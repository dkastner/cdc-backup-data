<p><strong>Vote on the Code 2015</strong></p>

<p><strong>Get involved. Become a CMAHC member. Join us for the CMAHC conference.</strong></p>

<p>CDC has worked with public health, academia, and aquatics industry representatives across the United States on developing the Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC), a voluntary guidance document to prevent drowning, injuries, and the spread of recreational water illnesses at public swimming pools and spas. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/pools/mahc/updating.html">The Council for the Model Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC),</a> a non-profit organization, was created to work in partnership with CDC to ensure that the MAHC is regularly improved and updated to keep pace with the latest science, industry advances, and public health findings.</p>

<p>CDC invites you to <a href="http://www.cmahc.org/membership.php">join the CMAHC</a> and add your voice, in person or virtually, to the chorus of public health and industry experts at the <a href="http://cmahc.org/biennial_conference.php">first <em>Vote on the Code</em> biennial conference, October 6-7, 2015.</a> The CMAHC exists solely to promote and sustain the MAHC. Unlike other codes, the MAHC is kept sustainable, current, and complete because the people who use it vote on its content every other year through membership in the CMAHC. These proposed changes are then passed by the CMAHC to CDC to advise CDC on how the MAHC needs to change to keep up with the latest science and best practices.</p>

<p>The CMAHC Technical Review Committee has completed a review of all proposed MAHC changes received in February 2015. All completed and final Change Request (CR) reviews, revisions, and member comments are <a href="https://cmahc.org/2015_change_requests.php?utm_source=Agenda,+Change+Requests+91715&amp;utm_campaign=Posted+CR+and+Agenda&amp;utm_medium=email">now posted for viewing and commenting</a> on the CMAHC website. Members are invited to comment on any proposed CRs or reviews. The CMAHC conference will include presentation of key CRs, the technical review, and summaries of member comments that are received by Thursday, September 30, as well as time for caucusing on the CRs and some floor discussion. The CMAHC will continue to accept comments through October 23 to help finalize the CRs, and electronic voting will start one month after the conference ends.</p>

<p>Help promote aquatic health, safety, and recreation. Join the CMAHC as a member and participate (in-person or online) in the <a href="https://cmahc.org/biennial_conference.php"><em>Vote on the Code</em> Biennial Conference</a> on October 6 – 7, 2015.

</ul>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>The Council for the Model Aquatic Health Code (CMAHC) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization created in 2013 to support and improve public health by promoting healthy and safe aquatic experiences for everyone. The CMAHC’s role is to serve as a national clearinghouse for input and advice on needed improvements to CDC’s Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). The CMAHC will serve in the key role of collecting, assessing, and relaying national input on needed MAHC revisions back to CDC for final consideration for acceptance into the MAHC. This process will keep the MAHC up to date with the latest scientific and operational lessons. The CMAHC will also 1) advocate for improved health and safety at aquatic facilities, 2) provide assistance to health departments, boards of health, legislatures, and other partners on MAHC uses, benefits, and implementation, 3) provide assistance to the aquatic industry on uses, interpretation, and benefits of the MAHC, and 4) solicit, coordinate, and prioritize MAHC research needs.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong></p>

<p>The 2014 CMAHC Organizational Meeting will be a unique opportunity for public health, aquatics, and other stakeholders to get in on the ground floor of deciding how this vital national entity will be organized and operated. We will discuss how the CMAHC should be organized, how proposed revisions to the MAHC will be submitted, discussed, and how final decisions and membership voting will be made on the recommendations to be sent to CDC. The meeting will also start the process of signing up volunteers to fill vital roles in the proposed submission review and discussion process and start planning for the first official CMAHC Conference to be held in October 2015.</p>

<h5>Make Swimming Healthier &#38; Safer: Model Aquatic Health Code 1st Edition Released Today</h5>

<br />
<h5>MAHC 1st Edition now available</h5>

<p>Today we launched the nation’s first voluntary guidelines based on science and best practices for improving health and safety at swimming pools and other aquatic venues: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/pools/mahc/structure-content/index.html"><strong>The Model Aquatic Health Code 1st Edition</strong></a>. States and localities can use the MAHC to create or update existing pool codes to reduce risk for outbreaks, drowning, and pool-chemical injuries.</p>

<p>Creating the MAHC has been a tremendous process, and CDC thanks the many organizations and individuals who have worked together to develop this document. The MAHC 1st Edition is a product of seven years of work, involving a steering committee, 12 technical committees, 140 people, and input and consensus from public health, aquatics, and academia. In two rounds of public comment, we received more than 4,400 comments—nearly three-quarters of which we accepted to make the MAHC even better.</p>

<h5>New materials to promote the MAHC</h5>

<p>The Lifeguard &#38; Bather Supervision Module and the Ventilation and Air Quality Module have been revised and re-posted after the first public comment period.</p>

<h5>Reminders</h5>

<p><strong>The first full “knitted” version of the MAHC is coming soon, and we want your feedback! </strong>We plan to release the first full version of the MAHC—a combination of all revised modules and supplemental information—in spring 2014 for a 60-day public comment period.</p>

<h5>Get a head start!</h5>

<p>Because the MAHC will be a long document, we encourage you to get a head start and begin compiling your comments now on the modules that have been revised after the first public comment period so that you have plenty of time to submit your feedback. The content of these modules will not change substantially, but we will have to reorganize information that may be duplicated in multiple modules and resolve conflicts where duplicate items make different recommendations. We will announce when the full version is posted and we are accepting public comments for 60 days.</p>

<p>Each module has a short synopsis or abstract highlighting the most critical recommendations. Please visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/pools/mahc/structure-content/abstracts.html">MAHC Module Abstracts page</a> for more information.</p>
