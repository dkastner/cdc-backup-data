								<h3>Outbreak Summary</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<h5>Introduction</h5><p>This was a complex multistate outbreak investigation of listeriosis cases occurring over several years. Public health investigators used the <a href="../../../pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA &quot;fingerprinting&quot; is performed on <em>Listeria</em> bacteria isolated from ill people using techniques called <a href="../../../pulsenet/pathogens/pfge.html">pulsed-field gel electrophoresis</a> (PFGE) and <a href="../../../amd/index.html">whole genome sequencing</a> (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks of enteric illness. Several PFGE patterns (strains) of <em>Listeria</em> were involved in this outbreak.</p><p>A total of 10 people infected with several strains of <em>Listeria</em> were reported from 4 states: Arizona (1), Kansas (5), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (3). Illness onset dates ranged from January 2010 through January 2015. The people with illness onsets during 2010&#8211;2014 were identified through a retrospective review of the PulseNet database for DNA fingerprints matching isolates collected from Blue Bell ice cream samples. All 10 (100%) people were hospitalized. Three deaths were reported from Kansas.</p><h5>Investigation of the Outbreak</h5><p>February 2015</p><p>In February 2015, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control isolated <em>Listeria</em> as part of routine sampling from Blue Bell brand single-serving ice cream products collected from a distribution center: Chocolate Chip Country Cookie Sandwiches and Great Divide Bars. In response to the findings in South Carolina, the Texas Department of State Health Services collected product samples from the Blue Bell Creameries production facility in Brenham, Texas, that made these products.&#160;Testing by Texas health officials yielded <em>Listeria</em> isolates from some samples of the same two products tested by South Carolina and from another Blue Bell ice cream product called &#8220;Scoops.&#8221; This product was made on the same production line as the Chocolate Chip Country Cookie Sandwiches and Great Divide Bars. PFGE was performed on the <em>Listeria</em> isolated from the ice cream samples; seven different PFGE patterns were identified and uploaded to PulseNet.</p><p>March 2015</p><p>In March 2015, Kansas health officials identified two people from the same hospital who were infected with <em>Listeria</em> bacteria that had the same PFGE pattern. Three additional listeriosis cases with three other PFGE patterns had previously been identified from the same hospital. All five people were hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing invasive listeriosis &#8212; a finding that strongly suggested their infections were acquired in the hospital. <em>Listeria</em> isolates from four of the five people had PFGE patterns that were also identified in ice cream tested by South Carolina and Texas. Although some of the illnesses occurred more than a year before this investigation began, all four people with available information consumed milkshakes made with the &#8220;Scoops&#8221; Blue Bell ice cream product while they were in the hospital. Isolates from four of these people were highly related to each other by whole genome sequencing. <em>Listeria isolated</em> from the fifth person was not related to isolates from the other four ill people. In addition, the PFGE pattern was not identified in any ice cream samples. However, this person was part of a recognized illness cluster at the hospital and consumed milkshakes made with &#8220;Scoops&#8221; while hospitalized. As a result, this person was included as a case in the outbreak. &#160;Illness onset dates for the five people ranged from January 2014 through January 2015. Three of these people died as a result of their <em>Listeria</em> infection.</p><p>On March 13, 2015, Blue Bell Creameries reported removing the &#8220;Scoops&#8221; ice cream product and other products made on the same production line from the market.&#160;The company also reported that it had shut down that production line at its Brenham, Texas, facility.</p><p>On March 22, 2015, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) reported that <em>Listeria</em> was isolated from a previously unopened, single-serving Blue Bell brand <a href="http://www.kdheks.gov/news/web_archives/2015/03242015.htm">3 oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cup</a> collected from the Kansas hospital involved in the outbreak. Samples of Blue Bell brand 3 oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cups collected from the company&#8217;s Broken Arrow, <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/BB_withdrawal">Oklahoma, facility</a> also yielded <em>Listeria</em>. <em>Listeria</em> isolated from ice cream cup samples were indistinguishable from each other by PFGE, but were different from those isolated from people in Kansas and from other Blue Bell brand ice cream products previously sampled in Texas and South Carolina. On March 23, 2015, Blue Bell announced a <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/BB_withdrawal">recall</a> of 3 oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups (with tab lids) of several flavors produced at the company&#8217;s Broken Arrow, <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/BB_withdrawal">Oklahoma, facility</a>.</p><p>April 2015</p><p>On April 3, 2015, CDC reported that illnesses might be linked to ice cream made in Blue Bell Creameries&#8217; Oklahoma facility, but lacked sufficient information to include them as cases in the outbreak at the time. These illnesses were identified when investigators searched the <a href="../../../pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> database and identified 6 people from Arizona (1), Oklahoma (1), and Texas (4) with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 who had <em>Listeria</em> isolates with PFGE patterns indistinguishable from isolates from the chocolate ice cream cups made in the Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, facility. The four people reported from Texas were hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Information available for one person indicated that they consumed ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis; the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups. None of the four people in Texas died from <em>Listeria</em> infection. At this point in the investigation, CDC recommended that consumers not eat and institutions and retailers not serve any products made at the company&#8217;s Oklahoma facility, in addition to any previously recalled or withdrawn products. That day, Blue Bell Creameries reported that they had voluntarily suspended operations at their facility in Oklahoma.</p><p>On April 8, 2015, CDC reported that whole genome sequencing confirmed that three of the four isolates from people in Texas were nearly identical to <em>Listeria</em> strains isolated from ice cream produced at Blue Bell Creameries&#8217; Oklahoma facility. These three people were added to the case count for the outbreak, bringing the total to 8. The fourth isolate was later determined not to be part of the outbreak by whole genome sequencing and this illness was not added to the case count.</p><p>On April 20, 2015, Blue Bell Creameries voluntarily <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/the_little_creamery/press_releases/all-product-recall">recalled</a> all products currently on the market made at all of its facilities, including ice cream, frozen yogurt, sherbet, and frozen snacks.Blue Bell announced this recall after sampling by the company revealed that Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream half gallons produced on March 17, 2015, and March 27, 2015, contained <em>Listeria</em>.</p><p>On April 21, CDC reported that whole genome sequencing confirmed that the people from Arizona (1) and Oklahoma (1) were part of the outbreak, bringing the total case count to 10.</p><p>May 2015</p><p>On May 7, 2015, FDA released the findings from recent inspections at the Blue Bell production facilities in <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM446107.pdf">Brenham, Texas [PDF - 4 pages]</a>; <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM445811.pdf">Broken Arrow, Oklahoma [PDF - 11 pages]</a>; and <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/OfficeofGlobalRegulatoryOperationsandPolicy/ORA/ORAElectronicReadingRoom/UCM445810.pdf">Sylacauga, Alabama [PDF - 5 pages]</a>.</p><p>This outbreak investigation is over.

    	<h5>Case Count Update</h5><p>This is a complex and ongoing multistate investigation of listeriosis occurring over an extended period. Several strains of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> are involved in this outbreak. Information indicates that various Blue Bell brand products produced in facilities in Texas and Oklahoma are the source of this outbreak.</p><p>The outbreak consists of two clusters of people infected with several strains of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> that were also found in products made at two Blue Bell facilities in Texas and Oklahoma. Eight people with <em>Listeria</em> infections related to this outbreak have been confirmed from two states: Kansas (5) and Texas (3). Three deaths were reported from Kansas.</p><p>Cluster 1 consists of five patients reported from Kansas during January 2014 through January 2015 who were all hospitalized at a single hospital for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Of the four ill people for whom information is available on the foods eaten in the month before <em>Listeria</em> infection, all consumed milkshakes made at the hospital with a Blue Bell brand ice cream product called &#8220;Scoops.&#8221; Whole genome sequences of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> strains isolated from four of the patients were found to be highly related to sequences of <em>Listeria</em> strains isolated from &#8220;Scoops&#8221; and two other products made on the same line at the company&#8217;s Texas facility. These products were recalled by Blue Bell Creameries on March 13, 2015.</p><p>Cluster 2 consists of three patients reported from Texas during 2011 through 2014 who were all hospitalized for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Whole genome sequences of their <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> strains were nearly identical to <em>Listeria</em> strains isolated from ice cream produced at the Blue Bell Creameries&#8217; Oklahoma facility.</p><p>Three additional patients with listeriosis during 2010 through 2012 whose isolates have PFGE patterns similar to those of others in the cluster have been identified in the PulseNet database; further molecular laboratory testing is under way to determine whether these illnesses may be related to this outbreak. Results of this testing will be reported once they are available.</p><h5>Investigation Update</h5><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently isolated <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> strains from a 1-pint container of Blue Bell brand banana pudding ice cream collected from the company&#8217;s Oklahoma production facility. This contaminated product was produced in the same facility but on a different line from the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm439533.htm">3 oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups</a> previously recalled.</p><p>On April 3, 2015, Blue Bell Creameries reported that they had <a href="http://www.bluebell.com/BB_withdrawal">voluntarily suspended operations</a> at their Oklahoma production facility. &#160;On April 7, 2015, Blue Bell Creameries announced a third product <a href="http://cdn.bluebell.com/the_little_creamery/press_releases/broken-arrow-expands-recall">recall</a> that included banana pudding ice cream pints and other products made on the same line that were produced between February 12, 2015 and March 27, 2015 at their Oklahoma facility. Further testing of environmental and product samples from Blue Bell Creamery facilities is ongoing.</p><p>Blue Bell Creameries previously issued two other recalls. On March 13, 2015, the company removed from the market &#8220;Scoops&#8221; and other products made on the same line at their Texas facility. On March 23, 2015, the company recalled 3 oz. institutional/food service ice cream cups of chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla flavors made at their Oklahoma facility.</p><p>CDC continues to recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the Oklahoma production facility (including the recalled products) and that retailers and institutions should not sell or serve them. This advice is particularly important for consumers at higher risk for listeriosis, including pregnant women, adults 65 and older, and people with weakened immune systems.

The pattern is rare.</p><p>CDC searched the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> database and identified six patients with listeriosis between 2010 and 2014 who had <em>Listeria</em> isolates with PFGE patterns indistinguishable from those of <em>Listeria</em> isolated from Blue Bell brand 3 oz. institutional/food service chocolate ice cream cups. Four of these six patients had been hospitalized in Texas for unrelated problems before developing listeriosis. Information is available for one patient; that patient reported consuming ice cream in a Texas hospital before developing listeriosis, and the Texas Department of State Health Services reported that the hospital had received Blue Bell brand ice cream cups. Investigation to determine whether these illnesses are related to exposure to Blue Bell products is ongoing.</p><p>Based on the information CDC has at this time, we recommend that consumers do not eat any Blue Bell brand products made at the company&#8217;s Oklahoma facility and that retailers and institutions do not sell or serve them.

    	<h5>March 13, 2015</h5><h5>Introduction</h5><p>State and local health officials, CDC, and FDA are collaborating to investigate an outbreak of <em>Listeria</em> <em>monocytogenes</em> infections (listeriosis). The joint investigation found that certain Blue Bell brand ice cream products are the likely source for some or all of these illnesses. <em>Listeria</em> can cause a serious, life-threatening illness.</p><p>Public health investigators are using the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA &quot;fingerprinting&quot; is performed on <em>Listeria</em> bacteria isolated from ill people using techniques called <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/pathogens/pfge.html">pulsed-field gel electrophoresis</a> (PFGE) and <a href="../../../amd/index.html">whole genome sequencing</a> (WGS). WGS gives a more detailed DNA fingerprint than PFGE. PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.</p><p>The five ill people included in this outbreak investigation have been reported from <a href="http://www.kdheks.gov/news/web_archives/2015/03132015.htm">Kansas</a> and were each infected with one of four strains of <em>Listeria</em> <em>monocytogenes</em> identified by PFGE. &#160;All five people were hospitalized at the same hospital for unrelated problems before developing invasive listeriosis &#8212; a finding that strongly suggests their infections were acquired in the hospital. Isolates from four of these patients are highly related by whole genome sequencing. Illness onset dates for the five patients ranged from January 2014 through January 2015. Although some illnesses occurred more than a year ago, the cluster was identified in March 2015 after health officials noted that two patients who had been in the same hospital were infected with <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> bacteria that were indistinguishable by PFGE. All five ill people are older adults, and three are women. Three deaths have been reported.</p><h5>Investigation of the Outbreak</h5><p>The information available at this time indicates that certain Blue Bell brand ice cream products are the likely source of this outbreak. <em>Listeria</em> can cause a serious, life-threatening illness. Of the four ill people for whom information is available on the foods eaten in the month before <em>Listeria</em> infection, all four consumed milkshakes made with a single-serving Blue Bell brand ice cream product called &#8220;Scoops&#8221; while they were in the hospital.</p><p>In an unrelated investigation, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control isolated <em>Listeria monocytogenes&#160;</em>from the following Blue Bell brand single-serving ice cream products collected from a distribution center in 2015: Chocolate Chip Country Cookie Sandwiches and Great Divide Bars. &#160;In response to the findings in South Carolina, the Texas Department of State Health Services collected product samples from the Blue Bell Creameries production facility in Brenham, Texas.&#160;These samples yielded <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> from the same two products tested by South Carolina and also from the ice cream Scoops, which is made on the same production line. <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>&#160;was not found in other Blue Bell brand ice cream products tested.</p><p>Three strains of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> isolated from the ice cream samples had PFGE patterns that were indistinguishable from those of <em>Listeria</em> bacteria obtained from samples from four patients. <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> isolates with four other PFGE patterns were also isolated from the ice cream samples. Invoices provided by the hospital to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment indicate that the Blue Bell brand ice cream Scoops used in the patients&#8217; milkshakes came from Blue Bell Creamery&#8217;s facility in Texas. Whole genome sequencing of the <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> isolates obtained from the ice cream is in progress.</p><p>One patient&#8217;s <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> strain has a PFGE pattern that does not match any identified in an ice cream sample. However, epidemiologic evidence, including acquiring infection at the same hospital as the other patients and consumption of the ice cream products, suggests that this illness may be related. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> to identify any additional ill persons whose illnesses may be related to this outbreak.</p><p>Blue Bell Creameries has reported removing from the market the Scoops ice cream product and other products made on the same production line.&#160;The company also has reported that it has shut down that production line.</p><p>Contaminated ice cream products may still be in the freezers of consumers, institutions, and retailers, given that these products can have a shelf life of up to 2 years. CDC recommends that consumers do not eat products that Blue Bell Creameries removed from the market, and institutions and retailers should not serve or sell them.
