<p>A message from the CDC&#8212;</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American women, and African-American women are disproportionately affected by it.

Sadly, most of our women aren&#8217;t aware of a local program to get a low-cost or even a no-cost mammogram.</p><p><strong>Annie Johnson:</strong> My name is Annie Johnson, and I am a 12-year breast cancer survivor.

<strong>Maya Angelou:</strong> As we get older, our chances of developing breast cancer increase. However, every year more women continue to live meaningful lives because their breast cancer was discovered and treated early. Every woman deserves to be healthy, and a good way to make sure you don&#8217;t have breast cancer is to have a mammogram every year. If you&#8217;re over 40, call about a free mammogram. Do it for yourself and the people you love. Every woman counts, every year.

<p>A message from the CDC&#8212;</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American women, and African-American women are disproportionately affected by it. That number doesn&#8217;t have to be that high. Sadly, most of our women aren&#8217;t aware of a local program to get a low-cost or even a no-cost mammogram.</p><p><strong>Shaquetta Smith:</strong> Hi. My name is Shaquetta Smith. I am a 16-year long breast cancer survivor. I want to encourage women to do breast self-examinations, get a mammogram, and a second opinion. You might not know if you have a job tomorrow. But you can have peace of mind knowing that you don&#8217;t have breast cancer. Choosing to get a mammogram is choosing life.</p><p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Call this number to find one of the many locations for screening today. 1-800-4CANCER. It could save your life or the life of a loved one. 1-800-4CANCER. That&#8217;s 1-800-4CANCER. It could save your life.</p>
