<p>Nigeria’s success in containing the Ebola outbreak to just 19 cases in two cities was due to surveillance and response systems already in place. A strong trained workforce through the Field Epidemiology Program (FETP) helped identify and isolate potential cases of Ebola. CDC responders joined 13 Nigerian FETP trainees and 40 FETP graduates to halt the outbreak within three generations of transmission. In total, the team identified 894 contacts, completed nearly 19,000 contact tracing home visits, and reached 26,000 households through a social mobilization strategy. They also established an Ebola treatment unit and trained Ebola caregivers in just two weeks. Also crucial was the Lagos Emergency Operations Center, which had been set up to address the polio outbreak in the country. The EOC housed experienced polio staff who had extensive experience in Nigeria, knew many of the key Ministry of Health officials, and understood the strengths and weaknesses of the nation’s health system...<br />

<p>A field epidemiology training program called FETP STEP, which was put in place to address the Ebola outbreak, turned out to also be key in thwarting a potentially devastating outbreak of polio. In September 2015, a 19-month-old child from Guinea crossed the border into Mali with a case of vaccine-derived polio. Drawing on his training, an FETP STEP graduate led surveillance and investigation in the affected district. Through contact tracing, he found that seven other children had been in contact with the child and would need close monitoring. CDC-trained personnel also worked with the Ministry of Health to launch an emergency vaccination campaign in Bamako and surrounding areas, and helped increase monitoring at the border...<br />

<p>Cameroon is taking lessons learned from previous outbreaks to shorten response times through their newly developed Emergency Operations Center, which serves as a role model for global health security success. In one year, experts reduced response time to a health emergency from 8 weeks to one week. When Cameroon’s EOC was activated for the first time in response to a cholera outbreak, it took more than eight weeks to get organized and respond. By the time their full resources were brought to bear on the outbreak, it was nearly over.

<p>In 2005, Nantikan, then eight years old, developed a rash. For many caregivers, a rash would not inspire panic, but Nantikan’s aunt and primary caregiver, Kulton, recognized its importance. “Nantikan’s sister died, then six months later her mother died, so we thought it would be important to have her tested,” said Kulton. “I thought she might have HIV.”<br />
