 <p>This Internet release of <em>Vital Statistics of the </em><em>United States, 2000, Volume I, Natality,</em> includes a total of 32 tables. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/techap00.pdf">2000 Natality Technical Appendix [PDF - 740 KB]</a> describes the data contained in the tables in this Internet release. </p>
 <p>NOTE: Population based rates included in these tables for 1991-2000 are based on the more accurate population estimates that incorporate the results of the 2000 census, and are available in the report, <em>Revised Birth and Fertility Rates for the 1990s and New Rates for Hispanic Populations, 2000 and 2001: United States</em>. Since the populations included in &quot;Births: Final Data for 2000,&quot; are based on postcensal population estimates consistent with the 1990 census, if you wish to calculate population based rates, please use those in <a href="../../data/nvsr/nvsr51/nvsr51_12.pdf">Revised Birth and Fertility Rates for the 1990s and New Rates for Hispanic Populations, 2000 and 2001: United States [PDF - 1.2 MB]</a>. </p>
 <p>The 2000 census-based population estimates used in Vital Statistics of the United States, 2000, Volume I, Natality, may differ from population estimates used in the series that have already been published for 1994-99, that were based on postcensal population estimates consistent with the 1990 census. In addition, Tables 1-30 through 1-37 published in earlier years (which contain cohort-fertility rates) are currently being revised to incorporate the 2000 postcensal estimates and are not available at this time. These tables will be available at this Website in the near future. </p>
