<h2><a name="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br>
Young adults have the highest smoking rate of any age group in the United States and Canada, and recent data indicate that they often initiate smoking as young adults. The objective of this study was to systematically 
review peer-reviewed articles on cigarette smoking initiation and effective prevention efforts among young adults.</p>
<p><b>Methods</b><br>
We searched 5 databases for research articles published in English between 1998 and 2010 on smoking initiation among young adults (aged 18-25) living in the United States or Canada. We extracted the following data from each study selected: the measure of initiation used, age range of initiation, age range of study population, data source, target population, sampling method, and sample size. We summarized the primary findings of each study according to 3 research questions and categories of
data (eg, sociodemographic) that emerged during the data extraction process.</p>
<p><b>Results</b><br>
Of 1,072 identified studies, we found 27 articles that met our search criteria, but several included a larger age range of initiation (eg, 18-30, 18-36) than we initially intended to include. Disparities in young adult smoking initiation existed according to sex, race, and educational attainment. The use of alcohol and illegal drugs was associated with smoking initiation. The risk of smoking initiation among young adults increased under the following circumstances: exposure to
smoking, boredom or stress while serving in the military, attending tobacco-sponsored social events while in college, and exposure to social norms and perceptions that encourage smoking. Effective prevention efforts include exposure to counter-marketing, denormalization campaigns, taxation, and the presence of smoke-free policies.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
Much remains to be learned about young adult smoking initiation, particularly among young adults in the straight-to-work population. Dissimilar measures of smoking initiation limit our knowledge about smoking initiation among young adults. We recommend developing a standardized measure of initiation that indicates progression to regular established smoking.</p>

<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
 
 
<p>Young adulthood represents a critical time in the transition from adolescence to adulthood, when changes in risk-taking behaviors such as experimenting with smoking become apparent (1,2). According to the 2009 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), 38% of current smokers aged 18 to 25 report they initiated regular smoking after age 18, a 27% increase from the 2007 NHIS estimate of 30% (3,4). In the 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 1 million people reported that they
initiated smoking as young adults, an increase from about 600,000 in 2002; during the same period, the increase in the number of initiates aged 18 or younger was considerably less, from 1.3 million to 1.4 million (5).</p>
<p>Until 1998, when Wechsler et al (6) reported that 28% of college students who smoked initiated smoking at age 19 or older, most public health researchers believed that smoking behavior (ie, initiation) was established by age 18 (7). Results from a follow-up survey (8) confirmed the delayed age of initiation. Soon after, others (2,7,9) began challenging the long-held assumption that smoking initiation mostly occurs before age 18.</p>
<p>Despite the increased interest in young adult smoking behavior, we found no systematic review of published research on this topic, except a review in 2003 that identified a lack of prevention research and anti-tobacco initiatives for young adults (1). The objective of our study was to summarize the current knowledge on young adult smoking initiation and effective prevention efforts targeting this population.</p>
	<p class="topOPage"><a href="11_0037.htm#">Top of Page</a></p>

<h2><a name="Methods"></a>Methods</h2>
<h3 class="h3">Study design </h3>
<p>We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed research articles published in English between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2010, on cigarette smoking initiation among young adults living in the United States or Canada. The following 3 questions guided our research:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which young adults initiate smoking?</li>
  <li>Under what circumstances does initiation among young adults take place?</li>
  <li>What programming and policy efforts reduce young adult smoking initiation?</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="h3">Definitions of terms </h3>
<p>Although we initially defined &#8220;young adults&#8221; as being aged between 18 and 25 years, we accepted other definitions in the research literature (eg, aged 18-24 y, 18-29 y, 18-36 y). We applied this definition to the age of initiation. Similarly, because we were unclear on a definition for &#8220;smoking initiation,&#8221; we accepted other terms, particularly when authors used the term &#8220;initiation&#8221; to discuss the phenomenon of smoking onset or the progression from nonsmoker to experimental
smoker or regular smoker. We considered articles that focused on the initiation of cigarette smoking only.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Data sources</h3>
<p>We searched 5 databases: Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition via the EBSCOhost search platform, and PubMed. We chose to search these databases because they are comprehensive and archive articles that are most closely related to our topic. We limited our search to articles published after January 1, 1998, because Wechsler et al published their article first documenting young adult smoking initiation in 1998. We used the medical subject headings
(MeSH) and free search terms &#8220;smoking (and) tobacco (and) prevention&#8221; crossed with terms identifying our population of interest, 
âyoung adult,â and âinitiation (or) uptake (or) onset.â We included variations of the original search terms (eg, 
âyoung adult smoking [and] initiation [or] uptakeâ) to ensure our search was comprehensive. Additionally, we included the term 
âpolicyâ when searching for articles related to the research question on programming and policy.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Study selection</h3>
<p>The initial search identified 1,072 peer-reviewed articles; of these, we identified 87 for further review. We excluded 985 articles on the basis of their title or abstract: 348 were duplicate entries, 232 focused on unrelated topics, 151 did not report on smoking initiation or on young adults, 102 were rooted in biomedical or genetic research or both, 77 studied populations outside the United States and Canada, and 75 studied other types of tobacco (eg, smokeless tobacco, cigars) or
nontobacco substances (eg, marijuana, cocaine).</p>
<p>Next, we reviewed all remaining abstracts and obtained full-text versions for 85 articles; full-text versions were not available for 2 studies (15,16). For these 2 studies, we analyzed the abstracts, which provided sufficient information to continue with the data extraction process. Two reviewers (K.S.F., N.M.N.) independently read the articles and coded them for inclusion or exclusion. Following independent review, the 2 reviewers met to discuss preliminary findings and to reach a consensus on
the studies to be included. Throughout the initial review process, we also coded some of the excluded articles as &#8220;background&#8221; because although they did not meet our exact inclusion criteria, they were otherwise relevant to young adult smoking initiation and could inform our understanding of the issue. Of the 87 articles (including 2 abstracts) reviewed, we excluded 69 for the following reasons: 12 did not focus on young adults, 23 did not focus on smoking initiation, 11 reported on findings
not relevant to our research questions, and 9 focused on other types of tobacco or nontobacco. We set aside 14 articles as background. In addition, we identified 9 articles through the list of references in the reviewed articles. Thus, we had a total of 27 articles (including 2 abstracts) for further analysis.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Data extraction</h3>
<p>Following study selection, the same 2 reviewers jointly extracted information on study design and results from the 27 selected articles. We organized the information into the following categories: target population, measure of smoking initiation, age range of initiation, age range of sample population, data source, sampling method, and sample size. We created subcategories for measures of smoking initiation when patterns emerged. We then summarized the primary
results of each study according to each of our 3 research questions and broad topical categories that emerged during the data extraction process and compiled information on significant results (<i>P</i> &#8804; .05). We evaluated the generalizability of study results by considering the study design and other information. We focused on describing results that could be generalized to broader populations but noted studies of narrower scope when they provided corroborating
evidence.</p>
 
 
<p class="topOPage"><a href="11_0037.htm#">Top of Page</a></p>

<h2><a name="Results"></a>Results</h2>
	
<p>Overall, the 27 studies included in this review<a name="table1_up"></a> (<a href="11_0037.htm#table1_down">Table 1</a>) identified 4 target populations: young adults in the general population (n = 14), college/university students (n = 9), military personnel (n = 3), and straight-to-work (STW) young adults (ie, young adults who are not enrolled in college or enlisted in the military) (n = 1). The measure of smoking initiation varied among the studies 
<a name="table2_up"></a>(<a href="11_0037.htm#table2_down">Table 2</a>).</p>
<h3 class="h3">Which young adults initiate smoking?</h3>
	
<p>Young adult men are more likely than young adult women to initiate smoking as young adults (2,10-12), and nonwhite adult smokers, especially Asian/Pacific Islanders (14) and African Americans (9,13-18), are more likely to initiate as young adults than as youth<a name="table3_up"></a> (<a href="11_0037.htm#table3_down">Table 3</a>). White young adults who attend college or enlist in the military, however, are more likely to initiate or progress in their smoking behavior while in college or in the military (19-21). Additionally, young adults who report
experimenting with smoking as youth (defined as &#8220;smoked at least 1 but fewer than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and did not smoke in the last 30 daysâ) are more likely to progress in their smoking behavior while in college (19), and young adults who report consuming alcohol (10,11,15,20,23,24,26) are also more likely to initiate smoking as young adults. We found evidence (10,11,20,26) to suggest that past 
illegal drug use is associated with a greater likelihood of initiating smoking among young adults
in the college/university population, although this evidence cannot be generalized to the broader population.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Under what circumstances does smoking initiation among young adults take place?</h3>
	
<p>Young adults who are exposed to smoking (eg, by family members, friends, coworkers, other social contacts) are more likely to initiate smoking or to smoke than are young adults who are not exposed to smoking (27) 
<a name="table4_up"></a>(<a href="11_0037.htm#table4_down">Table 4</a>). Similarly, military personnel with roommates who smoke, who are bored or stressed, and who perceive their leaders or classmates to be tobacco users are more likely to initiate smoking (12,21). Furthermore, young adults in the college/university population who
attend social events sponsored by the tobacco industry (28) as well as those who believe their friends approve of smoking or that experimenting with smoking is safe (19) are at increased risk of becoming smokers.</p>
<h3 class="h3">What programming and policy efforts reduce young adult smoking initiation?</h3>
	
<p>Despite a dearth of information on effective programs and policies, we found evidence that exposure to counter-industry marketing and denormalization campaigns (eg, the Truth campaign) is associated with decreased risk of smoking initiation (30,31) and less progression along a continuum of smoking intention and behavior (32) 
<a name="table5_up"></a>(<a href="11_0037.htm#table5_down">Table 5</a>). In addition, smoke-free policies (33) and cigarette tax increases (34) have been shown to reduce the number of young adults who initiate smoking.</p>

 
<p class="topOPage"><a href="11_0037.htm#">Top of Page</a></p>
	<h2><a name="Discussion"></a>Discussion</h2>
	
<p>Relative to the amount of research on young adult smoking behavior, few studies focused on the initiation of smoking among young adults. Because the 27 articles reviewed here varied widely in their research methods, ages studied, sample population, and measure of initiation, we found direct comparisons among the studies difficult to make.</p>
<p>Despite these challenges, this review provides information on what is known about young adults who initiate smoking and the circumstances under which they initiate. Our findings suggest that prevention efforts to reduce smoking initiation among young adults should target men and racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asian/Pacific Islanders (14) and African Americans (2,10,11,14-18), as well as college students, particularly whites (19,20,22,23), and young adults who use alcohol and other
illegal drugs (10,11,15,20,23,24,26). Many studies offered guidance on the design of prevention programs and policies for the young adult population. For example, because the evidence suggests that friends influence smoking initiation among young adults, prevention programs and policies that target this population should focus on the role of peers. Because young adults with pro-smoking perceptions (eg, young adults who think that smoking is not harmful) are more likely to initiate smoking,
prevention programs should also focus on education and the changing of social norms. Finally, because young adults who consume alcohol or have a history of past 
illegal drug use are more likely to initiate smoking as young adults, the development of comprehensive prevention programs and policies for this age group may impact an array of high-risk behaviors in addition to smoking initiation.</p>
<p>The lack of evidence on our question &#8220;What programming and policy efforts reduce young adult smoking initiation?&#8221; is a critical finding, given the trend in the prevention field toward evidence-based programs and outcomes. Although counter-industry marketing and denormalization strategies (30-32) are effective in preventing young adults from initiating smoking, recent evidence suggests that awareness of the national Truth campaign varies by sex and education level (35), highlighting the need
for more research on the effect of these programs. Whether the lack of information on the effectiveness of prevention programs and policies indicates a general shortage of programs and policies or a lack of research, effective programs focused on reducing smoking initiation among young adults need to be identified and promoted.</p>
<p>The small number of articles found on military personnel and the STW population is likely explained by the easier access to college/university populations and to national survey data for the general population. Young adults in the STW group are likely diffused in the general population and not easily identified as a target group. Whatever the explanation, the limited information available on the STW population is of concern. One study found that 30% of young adults not enrolled in college
(or without a college degree) smoked, compared to 14% of their college-educated counterparts (36). The study also found differences in smoking prevalence between white-collar and blue-collar workers within the STW population; those employed in the service industry and blue-collar occupations reported the highest rate of smoking prevalence among young adults aged 18 to 24, consistent with other studies (37,38). According to the US Census Bureau&#8217;s 2006-2008 American Community Survey,
approximately 41% of the nearly 30 million young adults aged 18 to 24 are currently enrolled in postsecondary education (39); thus, approximately 18 million young adults in the United States must be in the STW population or military (39). The STW population represents a sizeable at-risk group, about which little is known. We recommend making the young adult STW population a research priority: Who are they? Where do they work? Why do they start smoking? Answers to these questions can assist the
prevention community in designing effective programs and policies.</p>
<p>The use of dissimilar measures for smoking initiation among studies suggests that researchers may not be obtaining an accurate picture of the prevalence of smoking initiation among the young adult population. Two studies (40,41) suggest differences in the criteria for generating prevalence rates for smoking initiation among young adults and among adolescents. The measure for adult smokers is &#8220;smoked 100 or more cigarettes in lifetime&#8221; whereas for youth and adolescents, it is 
âsmoked 1 or
more days in the past 30 days.â Depending on the measure used, researchers may over- or underestimate the actual number of young adults at risk for progression to regular smoking. One study found that using the adult criteria for defining a smoker reduces the estimate of the prevalence of young adult smoking by as much as 18% (41). A growing body of evidence on the phenomenon of 
âoccasionalâ or &#8220;social smokers&#8221; who may not self-identify as smokers but who, nevertheless, are at risk of
becoming regular established smokers (42-46) further highlights the problems caused by dissimilar measures. Because tobacco researchers rely on measures of prevalence to identify disparities and to make policy recommendations, we need more accurate measures of prevalence for the young adult population. Moreover, because regular smoking starts with initiation, we need a measure of initiation that predicts progression to established smoking. Therefore, we recommend public health researchers work
to identify a standard measure of initiation that indicates progression to established smoking.</p>
<p>This study had limitations. We may not have identified all relevant studies, particularly if they were not indexed in the databases used for this review. We chose to include studies only from the United States and Canada that were published in English after January 1, 1998; hence, our review does not represent research published elsewhere.</p>
<p>Much remains to be learned about young adult smoking initiation in the United States and Canada. The lack of information suggests that tobacco preventionists and public health researchers need to prioritize access to data on young adults, particularly those in the STW population. Moreover, dissimilar measures of smoking initiation limit what public health researchers can know about smoking initiation among young adults. Because the transition from adolescence to adulthood (ie, young
adulthood) is a critical time &#8212; when changes in risk-taking behaviors become apparent &#8212; we need more research and expanded prevention efforts if we are to effect a reduction in the number of young adults who initiate smoking after age 18.</p>
