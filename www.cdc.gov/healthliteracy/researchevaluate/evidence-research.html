								<h3>Numeracy affects decision-making about health risks</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Numeracy describes a person’s ability to understand medical data. We use numeracy to make decisions about screening and treatment options. There are two types of numeracy: subjective and objective. Subjective numeracy is the level of confidence a person has about understanding medical data, while objective numeracy measures a person’s actual math skills. This collection of selected research examines how numeracy affects a person’s ability to understand visual displays of risk, text-only decision aids, and conversations with a health care professional. Overall, findings from these studies suggest numeracy plays a critical role in a person’s ability to make informed decisions about his or her health. People with low numeracy are at increased risk of poorer health outcomes. Public health and health care professionals can improve how they communicate with people who have low numeracy.

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+benefits+of+discussing+adjuvant+therapies+one+at+a+time+instead">Zikmund-Fisher and colleagues (2011)</a> studied how numeracy influences decisions about treatment for breast cancer recurrence in a sample of 1,781 women ages 40-74. Researchers used pictographs (also called <a href="http://www.iconarray.com/">icon arrays</a>) to present treatment choices all at once to one group and in a sequential pattern to a second group. All participants understood risk better when presented with a sequential choice of therapy compared to those who received information about all choices at once. Among women with high numeracy, chemotherapy was selected less often when presented with a sequential pattern and risk of recurrence was low. Women with low numeracy demonstrated greater sensitivity to risk reduction with a sequential pattern compared to seeing all choices at one time. &#160;<strong>Study findings suggest</strong> presentation of risk data in addition to sequencing choices makes it less likely a person will feel overwhelmed and accept treatment based on misunderstood information.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25277673">Hamstra and colleagues (2015)</a> studied how 420 men, median age of 52 years, used graph data to understand recurrence of prostate cancer over time. Participants were randomized to view one of four different graph types (pie, bar, pictograph, or line), with either one number (those affected) or two numbers (those affected and unaffected). Participants who viewed the pictograph with two numbers demonstrated the highest knowledge of cancer recurrence based on reading graph data. Numeracy level was associated with a study participant’s ability to answer questions based on using line graphs or pie charts. Numeracy level was not associated with a participant’s ability to answer questions based on using pictographs or bar charts. <strong>Study findings suggest</strong> a combination of numbers and graphical display, specifically pictographs, can be used successfully to communicate important information about risk.</p>

<p><strong>Text-only decision aids</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25512199">Smith and colleagues (2016)</a> studied the association between numeracy, knowledge and attitudes regarding a type of colorectal cancer screening test called fecal occult blood test or FOBt. The sample comprised 964 adults aged 45-59 years. Participants received a mailed booklet about colon cancer screening information. There were no differences in numeracy by age, gender, self-reported health, or marital status. Participants identified as low numeracy were more likely to report less education than those with higher numeracy. Those with low numeracy were more likely to have negative attitudes towards the FOBt and to agree with questions about practical attitudes such as challenges related to keeping stool in the house, privacy, and time. Low numeracy also suggested less likelihood to seek screening or cancer-related information and lower knowledge of colorectal cancer screening. <strong>Study findings suggest</strong> text-based materials tailored for people with low numeracy can be developed to <a href="../../ccindex/tool/page-16.html">describe what the numbers mean</a> and <a href="../../ccindex/tool/page-19.html">explain the perceived and actual risks and benefits</a> of a procedure or treatment.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26613709">Lopez-Perez and colleagues (2015)</a> examined the relationship between numeracy and decisions about treatment options for localized prostate cancer in a sample of 279 men over age 50. Researchers provided a written scenario describing prostate cancer and two common treatment options including data on risks and benefits for each. Researchers assessed objective numeracy, a person’s actual ability to solve math problems. Treatment choices were the same between men who had been screened for prostate cancer and those who had not been screened previously. Higher numeracy was associated with selecting active surveillance (AS) over radical prostatectomy (RP). Mortality risk for both options is similar but short term effects vary. RP reduces the potential for cancer growth over time but risks include urinary incontinence and erectile dysfunction. Men who choose AS risk the cancer growing more quickly and making it harder to treat in time, but the short term effect is transitory urinary incontinency. <strong>Study findings suggest</strong> addressing the information needs of people with low numeracy promotes understanding of long and short term risks and associated quality of life following a treatment decision.</p>

<p><strong>Communication with health care professionals</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21154091">Ciampa and colleagues (2010)</a> examined the relationship between numeracy and provider communication related to colorectal cancer screening in a sample of adults over age 50. The authors assessed both subjective (confidence in ability) and objective (actual ability) numeracy. Participants with low subjective and objective numeracy were older, non-White, reported less educational attainment and had lower annual income. Respondents with low subjective numeracy were less likely to report their provider ensured understanding, answered their questions, or engaged them in decision making. Respondents with low objective numeracy reported the opposite. Ciampa and colleagues explain this discrepancy by citing different communication needs among those with low subjective and objective numeracy. Low subjective numeracy was also associated with less screening practices. <strong>Study findings suggest </strong>the importance of assessing perceived confidence and actual ability to understand risk data and tailoring communication accordingly.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27943007">Janz and colleagues (2016)</a> surveyed a sample of early-stage breast cancer patients about their doctor’s communication regarding cancer recurrence after surgery. More than half of the study participants (n=3930) reported doctors used words and numbers to communicate risk. Respondents with low numeracy reported less discussion about risk of recurrence. Women who thought they had zero risk of recurrence or overestimated their risk of recurrence were less likely to report having conversations with their doctor about risk. The authors caution that verbal communication alone may lead to using words that are not precise (e.g., unlikely, low risk) and using numbers alone may create a barrier for people with low numeracy. <strong>Study findings suggest</strong> using both words and numbers to explain risk.

<p><strong>Numeracy and health outcomes</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Numeracy+Predicts+Risk+of+Pre-Hospital+Decision+Delay%3A">Petrova and colleagues (2016)</a> studied how numeracy influences a person’s decision to seek medical care when experiencing acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The sample of 102 participants were surveyed five days after experiencing ACS and had a mean age of 58 years. Increased survival rate for ACS is associated with seeking care within 1 hour of symptom onset. In this study, researchers measured objective numeracy using three items asking participants to solve basic math questions. Subjective numeracy was self-reported based on participants’ perceived numerical abilities. Participants with high objective and subjective numeracy reported higher level of education and were more likely to seek care within the first 50 minutes of experiencing cardiac symptoms. Higher objective and subjective numeracy was also associated with having fewer obstructed arteries. A higher objective numeracy level was associated with shorter delays in decision to seek care. <strong>Study findings suggest</strong> that people with low numeracy are at greater risk of delaying their decision to seek medical care and experiencing negative health outcomes as a result.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>You can support the information needs of people with low numeracy by 1) assessing perceived confidence and actual ability to understand risk data and 2) tailoring communication using a combination of text and visual formats that address perceived and actual risk.</p>

									<h3>Limited health literacy can affect self-care abilities, readmission, and early death for people diagnosed with heart disease</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>People with heart failure have various self-care activities they must perform, such as monitoring weight, salt and fluid intake, and assessing the effect of diuretics. For patients with limited health literacy, these critical activities can be complicated because they may already have difficulty understanding and using health information to take care of their health. This collection of selected research presents articles that examined the problem of limited health literacy and its influence on the ability of adult patients to manage heart disease. Findings support use of tailored programs to improve patients’ self-care techniques and delay or prevent re-hospitalization. Training staff to deliver tailored education to match people’s health literacy skills may produce health benefits for the patient and cost savings to the health care system.</p>

<p><strong>Training and staff support make a difference in reducing hospital readmission for patients with heart problems</strong></p>

<p>In two separate randomized control trials (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883526">Bell et al., 2016</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16533388">DeWalt et al., 2006</a>) researchers conducted tailored educational sessions, including follow up phone calls, with patients. Sessions included discussion of barriers to medication adherence and a plan to address those barriers. Control group participants in both studies received usual care. Bell and colleagues used pharmacist-provided education while DeWalt and colleagues trained health educators to conduct the intervention. Results from both studies suggest patients in the intervention groups were readmitted less often than those in the usual care groups. Further, DeWalt and colleagues found that compared to the control group participants, those in the intervention group demonstrated an increase in heart failure knowledge and self-efficacy. Additionally, DeWalt and colleagues noted that significantly more participants in the intervention group reported performing daily weight measurement compared to those in the control group up to 12 months after the intervention.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21099698">Dennison and colleagues (2011)</a> surveyed 95 hospital patients who received heart failure education provided by the heart failure care coordinator. Prior to hospital admission these patients were living in the community. Researchers cited that overall, participants demonstrated lower than expected heart failure knowledge scores after receiving standardized heart failure education. However, patients with inadequate health literacy demonstrated lower scores on heart failure knowledge compared to patients with marginal or adequate health literacy. &#160;Dennison and colleagues suggest that only providing inpatient education is not enough to increase knowledge of heart failure. Unlike the previous two studies (Bell et al., 2016, DeWalt et al., 2006), researchers in this study did not find an association between health literacy level and readmission rate.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Findings from these three studies suggest that a tailored approach to heart failure education is helpful for patients of various health literacy levels. The comprehensive approach should include adequate support such as easy to understand education about the patient’s condition or care regimen, and an opportunity for the patient to practice skills, resolve potential issues, ask questions as needed, and receive clinical staff follow up shortly after the sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Health literacy is associated with self-care behaviors related to heart disease</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26830514">Matsouka and colleagues (2016)</a> surveyed 249 heart failure patients in outpatient settings to assess knowledge of heart failure and related self-care behaviors such as daily weighing, fluid restriction, medication, and contacting health care providers when they experience increased weight gain. Health literacy was assessed in three areas: functional (ability to read and write), comprehensive (ability to access information), and critical (ability to evaluate information). Overall findings suggest that patients with lower health literacy had less knowledge of heart failure and reported performing fewer self-care behaviors, compared to those with higher health literacy.</p>

<p>Other factors associated with lower self-care behavior included age, prior hospitalization for heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and lower heart failure knowledge. An analysis of the different types of health literacy assessed in this study found that critical health literacy, the ability to evaluate information, impacted the practice of self-care behavior more than functional or comprehensive forms of health literacy.</p>

<p>In a large survey study of over 1300 patients with acute heart failure, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25926328">McNaughton and colleagues (2015)</a> found that patients with low health literacy had an increased risk of death compared to patients with average or above average health literacy. The researchers concluded that a heart disease patient with low health literacy will likely need more assistance from medical staff, particularly during discharge planning and after-care coordination to avoid readmission or death due to poor self-care.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>These findings suggest that health literacy influences how a person manages their care. Limited health literacy can increase the likelihood of poor health outcomes. Given that patients with heart failure need to perform monitoring behaviors and evaluate when to contact a health care provider, the task of assessing barriers to self-care, including limited health literacy, among heart disease patients is critical.</p>

									<h3>Applying health literacy strategies to the health needs of older adults</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Older adults often experience challenges related to managing multiple chronic conditions, changes in vision and hearing, and some older adults may experience cognitive impairments as they age. This collection of selected research from the last few years presents articles that examined the problem of low health literacy and its influence on an older adult’s ability to manage a health condition or medication regimen. Access ‘<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/talking-your-older-patient" target="_blank">Talking with Your Older Patient</a>’ to learn more.</p>

<p><strong>Asthma</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.3109%2F02770903.2013.852202" target="_blank">Federman and colleagues (2013)</a> assessed measures of asthma control, health resource use, and quality of life among older adults who had been diagnosed with asthma by a doctor. Approximately 158 (35%) of the 452 study participants had low health literacy. In addition, this subgroup was more often older (70 and above), Hispanic, reported low income and educational attainment, had fair or poor health, and a history of intubation. About 9% reported an asthma-associated hospitalization while 23% reported an asthma-associated visit to the emergency department. Findings suggest that older adults who have asthma and low health literacy may be more vulnerable to emergency care and hospitalizations. &#160;<a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/publication/talking-your-older-patient" target="_blank">Health care providers</a> have the opportunity to assess an older adults’ barriers to asthma self-management techniques including a person’s self-confidence, knowledge about the condition, and health beliefs.</p>

<p><strong>HIV</strong></p>

<p>To design a patient-centered HIV management intervention for African-Americans, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.2147%2FPPA.S69763" target="_target">Gakumo and colleagues (2015)</a> interviewed 20 patients receiving care at the clinic where the program would be delivered. Participants’ average age was 55 years. Interviewers asked participants about the types of things they wanted to learn about HIV and to describe their preferred learning style. Four themes emerged from the interviews: keep health information simple, use a team-based approach that includes a facilitator living with HIV, tailor to individual needs, and account for level of experience and interest in technology. Findings support the health literacy principle of keeping health messages and instructions simple to avoid overwhelming the person with HIV and risk disengaging them from their care. Use of <a href="http://patienteducation.stanford.edu/programs/psmp.html" target="_blank">self-management programs</a> may also help participants become more knowledgeable and involved in their healthcare decision-making.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Medication information</strong></p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1007%2Fs11096-014-9973-2" target="_blank">2014 study</a> examined 48 patient information materials on heart disease and type 2 diabetes to identify relevant information for older adults. Researchers found most of the materials were written at a high reading level and the font size on most of the materials was too small for ease of reading. Also, few materials described side effects specific to older adults and when they did it was rarely broken down by age group (over 65, over 80). Health professionals, such as pharmacists, can help older adults review these types of materials to ensure older adults understand how the medication may affect them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Delinda+Martin" target="_blank">Martin and colleagues (2012)</a> provided 20 participants of an adult day center with a personalized, illustrated medication schedule and six weeks later re-assessed how confident they felt managing their medications. Findings demonstrate a significant increase in self-efficacy and medication adherence after using the illustrated medication cards. Participants also reported the design of the medication cards helped them remember what each medicine was for and what time to take the medicine. Working with older adults, health professionals can reinforce medication adherence using images and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/quickreference/checklist.cfm">plain language principles</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=10.1002%2Fj.1875-9114.2012.01109.x" target="_blank">2012 study</a> on medication adherence, researchers divided older adult participants in two groups. The first received usual care, while the second received health topic-specific materials and education from the clinic pharmacist over 9 months. Additionally the pharmacist communicated with clinic doctors and nurses about any relevant medication issues. The authors found that, for patients who had low health literacy, medication adherence was significantly higher among those who received the pharmacist intervention than those who received usual care. This suggests that a tailored approach for patients with low health literacy can improve important health outcomes such as medication safety.</p>

									<h3>Health care professionals&#8217; use of health literacy-based communication techniques</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Patients need health care providers who can communicate clearly. Goal 2 of the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy outlines strategies all health professionals can use to identify and address health literacy barriers that negatively affect patient care and individual and community health outcomes.</p><p>Clinical professionals such as dentists, pharmacists, nurses, and physicians have an especially important role in improving health literacy and implementing strategies from the Action Plan.&#160; &#160;This brief summary of research from 2011 to 2014 describes the use of health literacy-based communication strategies by health care professionals.</p><p><strong>Dentists and Dental Hygienists</strong></p><p>In a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531934">2011 study</a>, two-thirds or more of dentists reported using four communication techniques to ensure effective communication with patients and their understanding of oral health information. &#160;These techniques include handing out printed materials, speaking slowly, using models or radiographs to explain, and using simple language.</p><p>These results were from a national survey to determine how frequently dentists use 18 communication techniques.

Pediatric dentists were more likely to ask patients to tell them what they will do at home to follow instructions (50%).</p><p>Results from health literacy environmental scans of community-based dental clinics are reported in a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922128">2014 study</a>.&#160; One component of these scans involved assessing the frequency of dentists&#8217; and dental hygienists&#8217; use of recommended communication techniques.

Two to four encounters were recorded per nurse. Clarifying health information was the most commonly applied technique (58% often used), followed by repeating health information (33% often used).

									<h3>Health literacy and medication labels, instructions, and regimens</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Poor quality and variability of medication labeling have been cited as key contributors to medication misuse. Evidence suggests that health literacy plays a significant role in determining how well patients interpret medication labels and take nonprescription and prescription drugs safely and appropriately.&#160; Recent research aimed at improving medication labeling is described below.</p><p><strong>Medication Labels</strong></p><p>A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24093344">study published in 2013</a> finds a patient-centered label was better at preventing participants from exceeding the maximum dose in 24 hours, compared to a standard label.

    	<p><strong>Research summary: Health literacy, patient activation and health outcomes</strong></p><p>A growing body of evidence shows individuals with the skills and confidence to become actively engaged in their health care have better health outcomes.&#160; Ongoing research seeks to determine the relative contribution of measures of health literacy and patient activation to improved outcomes.&#160; Some conceptualizations of health literacy include aspects of motivation and self-efficacy. However, other conceptualizations limit health literacy to a more skills-based construct that involves reading, math, speaking and listening abilities needed to make informed health decisions. While an individual&#8217;s motivation and confidence to engage in health self-management are often not measured as part of health literacy, they are included in measures of patient activation.</p><p>Below is a summary of recent research into these constructs, how they relate to each other, and their potential for improving outcomes such as health information seeking, comprehension and use, patient self-advocacy, mental and physical health, and costs.</p><p><strong>Health literacy, patient activation and health information seeking, comprehension and use</strong></p><p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24397280">A study published in 2014</a> investigates the relative contribution of patient activation and functional health literacy to the seeking and use of health information among adults in The Netherlands.&#160; While the researchers acknowledge alternative definitions of health literacy, such as broader definitions that include aspects of motivation, skills and self-efficacy, they employ a functional definition limited to the basic reading and numerical tasks required to function in a health environment.&#160; Among a sample from a consumer panel, they find patient activation to be a stronger predictor for seeking and using health information than functional health literacy.&#160;</p><p>Two of the three items used to measure functional health literacy were significantly related to patient activation.&#160; Those who were more confident with filling out medical forms had higher patient activation scores.

The relationship between health literacy and patient activation was weak, but significant. The researchers also examine the independent and combined associations of health literacy and patient activation with physical and mental health.&#160; Lower health literacy was associated with worse physical health and depression.&#160; Lower patient activation was associated with worse physical health and depression, as well as anxiety.

									<h3>Nutritional and food literacy, food labels, and portion size estimation </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p><strong>Research summary: Nutritional and food literacy, food labels, and portion size estimation</strong></p>

<p>Health literacy is used broadly to refer to how individuals understand, interpret, and apply health information. However, researchers continue to debate and define what it means to be nutritionally literate and food literate. While some researchers use nutritional literacy and food literacy synonymously, others distinguish the two and refer to nutrition literacy as going beyond understanding the origin of food, how it is cultivated and processed and its impact on health, to being able to act on nutritional information.</p>

<p>A growing body of research shows that individuals who accurately estimate portion sizes and interpret and use food labels have higher nutritional literacy and numeracy skills and realize better health outcomes. Using emolabels and strategies to ease comprehension may help children select more nutritious food and have healthy dietary behaviors.&#160;</p>

<p>Below is a summary of recent nutritional and food literacy research, with emphasis on food labels, portion sizes, and dietary behaviors.</p>

<p><strong>Children and food literacy</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666315002573">Privera et al.</a> conducted a study in which children were asked to choose 4 out of 12 food items in a grocery aisle setting with emo-labels added (happy = healthy; sad = not healthy) and again without emo-labels. Children made overall healthier food choices when emo-labels were present, even when they knew about the unhealthy options available. Emo-labels may not only promote healthier food choices for children, but researchers contend that they may also be a good tool to help increase health literacy at an early age and potentially help reduce rates of childhood obesity.</p>

<p>A preschool program in Australia designed to increase children’s food literacy and encourage children to enjoy vegetables shows that food literacy begins at an early age. The curriculum consists of a one or two hour weekly session taught by dieticians, preschool staff and volunteers.&#160; <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S149940461500127X">Whiteley &#38; Matwiejczyk</a> found that after the program, over 70% of children asked for and ate more vegetables and parents and preschool staff also reported that children were more knowledgeable about vegetables and had improved food literacy.</p>

<p><strong>Health literacy skills and use of food labels</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039409/">A 2014 study</a> finds that young adults with poor health literacy are not likely to use food labels to select food products and are more likely to report an unhealthy diet. &#160;People with higher self-efficacy use food labels more often.&#160; When people use the information on food labels regularly, they tend to have better dietary choices and have better health outcomes. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379706002819">Another study</a> also notes a correlation between poor food label comprehension and low literacy and numeracy skills.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_health_care_for_the_poor_and_underserved/v023/23.3.speirs.pdf">2012 study</a> examined the health literacy and nutrition behaviors of low income adults. Race and parental status were found to be significant predictors of health literacy among a sample of Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) eligible adults. Only 37% of participants had adequate health literacy, as assessed by the Newest Vital Sign (NVS), a health literacy measurement tool, and less than half of them reported using nutrition labels when purchasing food. &#160;Questions that required numeracy skills proved to be most challenging for participants. &#160;</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212267215002063">2015 study</a> used eye-tracking glasses to measure adults’ visual attention to the nutritional information of food products during a food selection task. Front labels used a familiar red, yellow and green sign and there was a sign with explanatory information near the product. Back labels were the usual nutrition label. Nutrition labels located on the front of products were more likely to be viewed by participants than those located on the back, suggesting that consumers may be more willing to read the shortened and simplified labels.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1499404613004697">Sinclair &#38; Hammond</a> investigated how well adults could comprehend food labels. They found that although people self-report high levels of understanding, their actual comprehension of food label information is much lower. Comprehension was lowest among most disadvantaged socioeconomic groups. Higher education and income, and White ethnicity positively correlated with correctly answering questions pertaining to percentage of daily nutritional value of food products.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Portion Size</strong></p>

<p>A<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3423082/"> 2011 study</a> examined visual representations of food portion sizes on a web interface, noting that digital applications that help people keep track of their food intake are not always apt for people with low literacy or numeracy skills.&#160;&#160; Researchers noted that it is difficult for people with low literacy to estimate portion sizes and their food intake. &#160;Participants often preferred hand gestures such as the shape of a fist, or an extended palm to estimate portion size of shapeless foods, and were more accurate about estimating liquids and shapeless food items, rather than solids.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(08)01012-X/pdf">study by Huizinga et al.</a> found that although 91% of study participants reported completing high school, only 65% of them were accurate when asked to serve a single serving of food. Participants who overestimated how much food constitutes a single serving were much more likely to have low literacy and numeracy skills than adults who provided accurate estimates.</p>

<h3>Science Bites</h3>

<h4>Use pictures to improve health communication</h4>

<p>Pictures that are closely linked to written or spoken text and have minimal distracting details can be helpful to individuals with low literacy skills. For evidence of how adding pictures to written and spoken language can increase the effectiveness of health education materials see: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16122896">The role of pictures in improving health communication: A review of research on attention, comprehension, recall, and adherence. (2006)</a></p>

<h4>Make orally delivered health information accessible and actionable</h4>

<p>Just as written material can be made more reader-friendly, orally delivered health information can be made more accessible and actionable. For evidence of how the features of language and interactivity contribute to literacy see: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17614177">Assessing oral literacy demand in genetic counseling dialogue: Preliminary test of a conceptual framework. (2007)</a>.</p>

<h4>Use headings to help readers scan and find information</h4>

<p>Headings can be helpful organizational elements that ease the reading and use of your materials. Remember, people read our materials because they want to understand something about their health, make a decision, and take action. Descriptive headings should clearly communicate the purpose of the material, who it is for, and how to use it. Readers can skim and make quick judgments about what's worth reading.</p>

<p>For evidence of how descriptive headings and simplified print presentations increase comprehension and recall of informed consent information among those with limited literacy skills see: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140461">The effect of format modifications and reading comprehension on recall of informed consent information by low-income parents: A comparison of print, video, and computer-based presentations. (2004)</a></p>

<p>Headings are also very important in webpage layout. See <a href="http://guidelines.usability.gov/guidelines/84">usability.gov</a> for instruction on how to use descriptive headings throughout a website to help users scan and find information quickly.</p>

<h4>Use narrative communication</h4>

<p>Public health information is often presented in numbers and statistics. However, the public may be disinterested or confused by scientific data. You can use narratives such as anecdotes, quotations, examples, vignettes, and personal stories to describe subjects your audience is familiar with. Narratives increase the chance your audience will pay attention to and remember information. Studies find narratives can lead to cancer-relevant belief and behavior change (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2006.00288.x/full">Green, M.C., 2006</a>) and to be more effective than statistical evidence on some patient outcomes (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738399107003357">Mazor et al., 2007</a>).</p>

<p>For more information about narratives and health communication see <a href="http://heb.sagepub.com/content/34/5/777.short">Hinyard, L.J. &#38; Kreuter, M.W. (2007). Using Narrative Communication as a Tool for Health Behavior Change: A Conceptual, Theoretical, and Empirical Overview</a></p>

<p><span class="toTop"><span class="icon-angle-up"><!-- --></span>&#160;<a href="evidence-research.html#">Top of Page</a></span></p>

<h4>Chunk information to improve audience comprehension and recall</h4>

<p>Readers can handle only a limited amount of information at one time. By grouping information into meaningful "chunks" of reasonable size, we can save our audience from experiencing information overload and improve their ability to organize and recall the material. Doak and colleagues suggest that readers with less education and training may not comfortably process more than 5 pieces of information at a time. See <a href="http://cdn1.sph.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/135/2012/09/doak5-7.pdf">Chapter 5 [6.0 MB, 68 pages]</a> from Doak, Doak, &#38; Root, 1996, <em>Teaching Patients with Low Literacy Skills</em> for an example of how to chunk information.</p>

<p>To learn more about this topic see <a href="http://www.musanim.com/miller1956/">George A. Miller's classic article on recall</a> that established about seven chunks as the brain's limit for holding information in short-term memory.</p>

<h4>Explain risk and numbers</h4>

<p>Practical, science-based advice on explaining risks and numbers includes using numbers rather than words alone to explain risk, providing absolute risk (10 out of 100), and keeping the denominators and time frames the same when making comparisons. See <a href="http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/ucm268078.htm">Communicating Risks and Benefits: An Evidence-based User's Guide</a> from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for more evidence on when and how to use numbers and explain risks to the public and patients.</p>

<h4>Anticipate and assess audiences' emotional reactions to risk information</h4>

<p>Every risk communication is processed both cognitively and emotionally. Success in a risk communication must be measured not only by what recipients know but by how they feel.<br />
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20739135">Zikmund-Fisher, Fagerlin &#38; Ubel, 2010, Risky feelings: Why a 6% risk of cancer does not always feel like 6%, p. S92</a></p>

<h4>Understand how numbers affect comprehension and decisions</h4>

<p>Numeracy is related to perceptions of health-related risks and benefits. Participants lower in numeracy tend to overestimate the risk of cancer and other risk, are less able to use risk reduction information (e.g. about screening) to adjust their risk estimates, and may overestimate benefits of certain treatments.<br />
<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19883143">Reyna, Nelson, Han &#38; Dieckmann, 2009, How numeracy influences risk comprehension and medical decision making, p. 957</a></p>

<h4>Design for improved comprehension among limited health literacy populations</h4>

<p>The following specific design features seemed to improve comprehension for low-health-literacy populations in one or a few studies: (1) presenting essential information by itself (i.e. (sic) information on hospital death rates without other distracting information, such as information on consumer satisfaction); (2) presenting essential information first (i.e. (sic) information on hospital death rates before information about consumer satisfaction); (3) presenting health plan quality information such that the higher number (rather than the lower number) indicates better quality; (4) using the same denominators to present baseline risk and treatment benefit; (5) adding icon arrays to numerical presentations of treatment benefit; and (6) adding video to verbal narratives.<br />
