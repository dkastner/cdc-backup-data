                        <h3 id="q3">Question 3: What interventions best prevent or contain outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis in the healthcare setting?</h3>
                        <p>To address this question, 69 studies [58,63,66,79,83-85,87,89,92,102,103,112,148-203] were critically reviewed for evidence of interventions that might prevent or attenuate an outbreak of norovirus.  The available data dealt with viral shedding, recovery of norovirus, and components of an outbreak prevention or containment program, including the use of medications.  The evidence consisted of 1 randomized controlled trial,[202] 1 systematic review,[153] 20 basic science studies, [112,162,163,185-201] 43 descriptive studies, [58,63,79,83-85,87,89,92,102,103,149-152,154-161,165-184] and 4 observational studies.[66,148,164,203]  The findings from the evidence review and the grades of evidence for clinically relevant outcomes are shown in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/norovirus/tables/evidence-table-q3-copcp.html">Evidence</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/norovirus/tables/grade-table-Q3.html">Grade Table 3</a>.  </p>

                        <h3 id="q3a">Q3.A Viral Shedding</h3>
                        <p>This  review did not identify studies demonstrating direct associations between viral  shedding and infectivity.  However, there  was low-quality evidence to support an association between age and duration of  viral shedding.[149,150]   One observational study suggested that children under the age of six  months may be at an increased risk of prolonged viral shedding (greater than  two weeks), even after the resolution of symptoms.[148]   Other findings suggest that infants can shed higher titers of virus than  levels reported in other age groups.[149]    High-quality evidence was available to demonstrate the presence of viral  shedding in asymptomatic subjects, and low-quality evidence demonstrating that  shedding can persist for up to 22 days following infection and 5 days after the  resolution of symptoms.[150-152]   The search strategy employed did not identify studies that correlated  other clinical factors to duration of viral shedding. </p>

                        <h4 id="q3b1"><em>Q3.B.1 Fomites </em></h3>
                        <p>There  was low-quality evidence positively associating fomite contamination with  norovirus infection.[153-159,161,163,194]   Similarly, there was low-quality evidence demonstrating transfer of  norovirus from fomites to hands.[194]   One basic science study demonstrated that norovirus on surfaces can be  readily transferred to other fomites (telephones, taps, door handles) via  fingertips in 30-50% of opportunities even when virus has been left to dry for  15 minutes.[194]   There was moderate quality evidence examining the norovirus  contamination of the environment.[153-159,161,163]   A single systematic review evaluated 5 outbreaks with environmental  sampling data.[153]   Three of those outbreaks confirmed environmental contamination with  norovirus.  Of the over 200 swabs  examined from the 5 outbreaks in this review, 36% identified norovirus  contamination on various fomites such as curtains, carpets, cushions, commodes  and toilets, furnishings and equipment within 3-4 feet of the patient,  handrails, faucets, telephones, and door handles. However, in two outbreaks from  which 47 environmental samples were collected, norovirus was not detected.    Additional studies detected norovirus on  kitchen surfaces, elevator buttons, and other patient equipment. [154-157,  194]  </p>
                        <p>There  was low-quality evidence regarding the duration of norovirus persistence. [154,155,157-159,161]   Norovirus can persist in a dried state at room temperature for up to  21-28 days and, in a single observational study, was undetectable in areas of  previously known contamination after 5 months had elapsed.[159]   Laboratory studies comparing FCV and MNV-1 also demonstrated persistence  of virus in both dried and in fecal suspensions for a minimum of seven days on  stainless steel preparations at 4&deg;C and at room temperature.20   Within a systematic review, it was observed that norovirus may remain  viable in carpets up to 12 days, despite regular vacuuming.153   Similarly, a cultivable surrogate for human strains of norovirus (FCV)  was detected on computer keyboards and mice, as well as telephone components up  to 72 hrs from its initial inoculation.156   This search strategy did not find studies in which the recovery of  norovirus from fomites, food, and water sources was directly associated with  transmission of infection in healthcare settings; however transmission from  these sources has been well documented in other settings.       </p>
                        <h4 id="q3b2"><em>Q3.B.2 Foods and Food  Preparation Surfaces</em></h3>
                        <p>There  was low-quality evidence suggesting that foods and food-preparation surfaces are  significant sources of norovirus transmission in healthcare settings.112,162,163   There was moderate quality evidence among three basic science studies to  suggest that norovirus can be recovered from foods such as meats and produce as  well as from utensils and non-porous surfaces (e.g., stainless steel, laminate,  ceramics) upon which foods are prepared.112,162,163   Two of these studies, comprised of low-quality evidence, suggested that  the transfer of diluted aliquots of norovirus from stainless steel surfaces to  wet and dry food, and through contaminated gloves was detectable using PCR  methods.  Norovirus transfer was  statistically more efficient when it was inoculated onto moist surfaces  compared to dry ones.[162,163] </p>
                        <p>There  was low-quality evidence to suggest that norovirus persists for longer periods  in meats compared to other foods and non-porous surfaces, both at 4&deg;C and at  room temperature.[112]   There was moderate quality evidence demonstrating that over a period of  7 days after application, both human norovirus genogroup I and a surrogate  (FCV) could be detected among all surfaces tested.[112,162]   Within the first hour, the log<sup>10</sup> of FCV titers declined by 2-3, with an  additional drop of 2-4 after 48 hours elapsed.[162]   Food and food-preparation areas can serve as a common source of  contamination with norovirus in the absence of cleaning and disinfection. </p>
                        <h4 id="q3b3"><em>Q3.B.3 Water</em></h3>
                        <p>This  search strategy did not identify studies that measured the contribution of  norovirus-contaminated water to outbreaks in the healthcare setting.  However, there was moderate quality evidence  to suggest that norovirus could be recovered from water. [155,158,160]   Among three outbreaks that examined water as a source, one identified  norovirus in 3 of 7 water samples.[160]   In outbreaks in the community, which were outside the scope of this  review, contaminated surface water sources, well water, and recreational water  venues have been associated with outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.[204] </p>

                        <h3 id="q3c">Q3.C Components of an  Outbreak Prevention/Containment Program</h3>
                        <p>As  with most infection-prevention and control activities, multiple strategies are  instituted simultaneously during outbreaks in healthcare settings.  Thus, it is difficult to single out  particular interventions that may be more influential than others, as it is  normally a combination of prudent interventions that reduce disease  transmission.  Numerous studies cite the  early recognition of cases and the rapid implementation of infection control  measures as key to controlling disease transmission.  The following interventions represent a  summary of key components in light of published primary literature and  addressed in seminal guidelines on outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.</p>
                        <h4 id="q3c1"><em>Q3.C.1 Hand Hygiene</em> </h3>
                        <h4 id="q3c1a"><em>Q3.C.1.a Handwashing  with soap and water</em></h4>
                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence was available to confirm that handwashing with soap and  water prevents symptomatic norovirus infections. [63,66,79,85,89,102,103,165,166,168-171,173-177,183]   Several descriptive studies emphasized hand hygiene as a primary  prevention behavior and promoted it simultaneously with other practical  interventions.  Several outbreaks  centered in healthcare augmented or reinforced hand hygiene behavior as an  early intervention and considered it an effective measure aimed at outbreak  control. [103,165,168,170,174,176,177,183]   The protocols for hand hygiene that were reviewed included switching to  the exclusive use of handwashing with soap and water, and a blend of  handwashing with the adjunct use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers.   Additional guidance is available in the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr5116.pdf">2002  HICPAC Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health-Care Settings [PDF - 495 KB]</a>.</p>
                        <h4 id="q3c1b"><em>Q3.C.1.b  Alcohol-based hand sanitizers</em></h4>
                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence was available to suggest that hand hygiene using  alcohol-based hand sanitizers may reduce the likelihood of symptomatic  norovirus infection. [66,87,169,171,205]   Several studies used FDA-compliant alcohol-based hand antiseptics during  periods of norovirus activity as an adjunct measure of hand hygiene. [66,87,168,169,171,205,206]   Two studies used a commercially available 95% ethanol-based hand  sanitizer along with handwashing with soap and water; but without a control  group and with hand hygiene comprising one of several interventions, the  relative contribution of hand hygiene to attenuating transmission was difficult  to evaluate. [169,171]   In the laboratory, even with 95% ethanol products, the maximum mean  reduction in log<sup>10</sup> titer reduction was 2.17.[193]   Evidence to evaluate the efficacy of alcohol-based hand disinfectants  consisted of basic science studies using FCV as a surrogate for norovirus.  Moderate quality evidence supported ethanol  as a superior active ingredient in alcohol-based hand disinfectants compared to  1-propanol, particularly when simulated organic loads (e.g. fecal material)  were used in conjunction with exposure to norovirus. [189,191,193,196]  The use of hand sanitizers with mixtures of ethanol and propanol have  shown effectiveness against FCV compared to products with single active  ingredients (70% ethanol or propanol) under controlled conditions.[189]   There were no studies available to evaluate the effect of non-alcohol  based hand sanitizers on norovirus persistence on skin surfaces.</p>
                        <h4 id="q3c1c"><em>Q3.C.1.c Role of  artificial nails </em></h4>
                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence suggested that the magnitude in reduction of a norovirus  surrogate (FCV) using a spectrum of soaps and hand disinfectants was  significantly greater among volunteers with natural nails compared to those  with artificial nails.[197]   A subanalysis showed that longer fingernails were associated with  consistently greater hand contamination.   Further evidence summarizing the impact of artificial and long fingernails  in healthcare settings can be found in the HICPAC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Handhygiene/">Guidelines for Hand Hygiene  in Healthcare Settings</a>.</p>

                        <p>There  was very low-quality evidence among several descriptive studies to support  patient cohorting or placing patients on Contact Precautions as an intervention  to prevent symptomatic norovirus infections in healthcare settings.[87,166-171,173,176,177,179-182,184]   No evidence was available to encourage the use of Contact Precautions  for sporadic cases, and the standard of care in these circumstances is to  manage such cases with <a href="../Disinfection_Sterilization/toc.html">Standard Precautions</a>.  Fifteen descriptive studies used isolation  precautions or cohorting practices as a primary means of outbreak management.[87,166-171,173,176,177,179-182,184]    Patients were cared for in single occupancy (e.g., private) rooms,  physically grouped into cohorts of symptomatic, exposed but asymptomatic, or  unexposed within a ward, or alternatively, with entire wards placed under  Contact Precautions.  Exposure status  typically was based on a person’s symptoms and/or physical and temporal  proximity to norovirus activity.  A few  studies cited restricting patient movements within the ward, suspending group  activities, and special considerations for therapy or other medical  appointments during outbreak periods as adjunct measures to control the spread  of norovirus.[63,169,182,183] </p>
                        <h4 id="q3c5"><em>Q3.C.5 Staff  Cohorting</em></h3>
                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence supported the implementation of staff cohorting and the  exclusion of non-essential staff and volunteers to prevent symptomatic  norovirus infections.[87,103,165,168-170,172,173,177,179,180,182,183]   All studies addressing this topic were descriptive.  Staff was designated to care for one cohort  of patients (symptomatic, exposed but asymptomatic, or unexposed).  Exposed staff was discouraged from working in  unaffected clinical areas and from returning to care for unexposed patients  before, at a minimum, allowing 48 hours from their last putative exposure to  elapse.[177]   The search strategy did not identify healthcare personnel other than  nursing, medical, environmental services, and paramedical staff who were  assigned to staff cohorting.  There were  no identified studies that evaluated the infectious risk of assigning recovered  staff as caregivers for asymptomatic patients.</p>
                        <h4 id="q3c6"><em>Q3.C.6 Ward Closure</em></h3>
                        <p>Low-quality  evidence was available to support ward closure as an intervention to prevent  symptomatic norovirus infections.[85,164-166,168,173,176-179,183,184]   Ward closure focused on temporarily suspending transfers in or out of  the ward, and discouraged or disallowed staff from working in clinical areas  outside of the closed ward.  One  prospective controlled study evaluating 227 ward-level outbreaks between 2002  and 2003 demonstrated that outbreaks were significantly shorter (7.9 vs. 15.4  days, p&lt;0.01) when wards were closed to new admissions.[164]   The mean duration of ward closure was 9.65 days, with a loss of 3.57  bed-days for each day the ward was closed.   The duration of ward closure in the descriptive studies examined was  dependent on facility resources and magnitude of the outbreaks.  Allowing at least 48 hours from the  resolution of the last case, followed by thorough environmental cleaning and  disinfection was common before re-opening a ward.  Other community-based studies have used  closures as an opportunity to perform thorough environmental cleaning and  disinfection before re-opening.  Two  studies moved all patients with symptoms of norovirus infection to a closed  infectious disease ward and then performed thorough terminal cleaning of the  vacated area.[170,172]    In most instances, studies defended that it was preferable to minimize  patient movements and transfers in an effort to contain environmental contamination.   </p>

                        <p>There  was very low-quality evidence on the impact of staff and/or patient education  on symptomatic norovirus infections.[166,168,169,172,173,182]   Six studies simply described education promoted during outbreaks.[166,168,169,172,173,182]  Content for education included recognizing  symptoms of norovirus, understanding basic principles of disease transmission,  understanding the components of transmission-based precautions, patient  discharges and transfer policies, as well as cleaning and disinfection  procedures.  While many options are  available, the studies that were reviewed used posters to emphasize hand  hygiene and conducted one-on-one teaching with patients and visitors, as well  as holding departmental seminars for staff.   The literature reviewed failed to identify research that examined the  impact of educational measures on the magnitude and duration of outbreaks of  norovirus gastroenteritis, or what modes of education were most effective in  promoting adherence to outbreak measures.  </p>

                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence was available to support the benefits of having established  written policies and a pre-arranged communication framework in facilitating the  prevention and management of symptomatic norovirus infections. [63,84,172,182-184]   Six descriptive studies outlined the need for  mechanisms to disseminate outbreak information and updates to staff, laboratory  liaisons, healthcare facility administration, and public health departments. [63,84,172,182-184]   The search of the literature did not yield any studies to demonstrate  that facilities with written norovirus policies already in place had fewer or shorter  outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.</p>

                        <p>There  was very low-quality evidence examining the benefit of delayed discharge or  transfer for patients with symptomatic norovirus infection.[172,179,183,184]   Transfer of patients after symptom resolution was supported in one study  but discouraged unless medically necessary in three others.  Discharge home was supported once a minimum  of 48 hours had elapsed since the patient’s symptoms had resolved.  For transfers to long-term care or assisted  living, patients were held for five days after symptom resolution before  transfer occurred.  The literature search  was unable to identify studies that compared the impact of conservative patient  discharge policies for recovered, asymptomatic patients.</p>

                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence was available to support cleaning and disinfection of  frequently touched surfaces to prevent symptomatic norovirus infection.[79,153,168,183]   One systematic review[153] and three descriptive studies[79,168,183] highlighted the need to routinely  clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (e.g., patient and staff  bathrooms and clean and dirty utility rooms, tables, chairs, commodes, computer  keyboards and mice, and items in close proximity to symptomatic patients).  One systematic review[153] and two descriptive studies[102,177,183,184] supported-steam cleaning carpets once  an outbreak was declared over.  Within  the review, a single case report suggested that contaminated carpets may  contain viable virus for a minimum of twelve days even after routine dry  vacuuming.[153]   Routine cleaning and disinfection of non-porous flooring were supported  by several studies, with particular attention to prompt cleaning of visible  soiling from emesis or fecal material.[153,168]   There were no studies directly addressing the impact of surface  disinfection of frequently touched areas on outbreak prevention or containment.</p>
                        <h4 id="q3c12b"><em>Q3.C.12.b Process of  environmental disinfection</em></h4>
                        <p>There  was very low-quality evidence supportive of enhanced cleaning during an  outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis.[168, 170, 177, 179]   Several studies cited increasing the frequency of cleaning and  disinfection during outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.[168, 170, 177, 179]   Ward-level cleaning was performed once to twice per day, with frequently  touched surfaces and bathrooms cleaned and disinfected more frequently (e.g.,  hourly, once per shift, or three times daily).   Studies also described enhancements to the process of environmental  cleaning.  Environmental services staff  wore PPE while cleaning patient-care areas during outbreaks of norovirus  gastroenteritis.[176,177, 179, 205]   Personnel first cleaned the rooms of unaffected patients and then moved  to the symptomatic patient areas [159].  Adjunct measures to minimize environmental  contamination from two descriptive studies included labeling patient commodes  and expanding the cleaning radius for enhanced   cleaning within the immediate patient area to include other proximal  fixtures and equipment.[170,177]   In another study, mop heads were changed at an interval of once every  three rooms.[168]   This literature search was not able to identify whether there was an association  with enhanced cleaning regimens during outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis  and the attenuation in outbreak magnitude or duration.</p>

                        <p>There  was very low-quality evidence to support the cleaning of patient equipment or  service items to reduce symptomatic norovirus infections.[168,172,177]   Three descriptive studies suggested that patient equipment/service items  be cleaned and disinfected after use, with disposable patient care items  discarded from patient rooms upon discharge.[168,172,177]   A single descriptive study used disposable dishware and cutlery for  symptomatic patients.[172]   There were no identified studies that directly examined the impact of  disinfection of patient equipment on outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.</p>

                        <p>Very  low-quality evidence was available to examine the impact of fabric disinfection  on norovirus infections.[153,168,177,183]   One systematic review[153] and three descriptive studies[168,177,183] suggested changing patient privacy  curtains if they are visibly soiled or upon patient discharge.  One descriptive study suggested that soiled,  upholstered patient equipment should be steam cleaned[135, 159]. If  this was not possible, those items were discarded.  Two descriptive studies emphasized careful  handling of soiled linens to minimize re-aerosolization of virus.[177,183]   Wheeling hampers to the bedside or using hot soluble hamper bags (e.g.,  disposable) were suggested mechanisms to reduce self-contamination.  This literature search did not identify  studies that examined the direct impact of disinfection of fabrics on outbreaks  of norovirus gastroenteritis or whether self- contamination with norovirus was  associated with new infection.  </p>
                        <h4 id="q3c12e"><em>Q.3.C.12.e Cleaning  and disinfection agents</em></h4>
                        <p>The  overall quality of evidence on cleaning and disinfection agents was very low.[63,83,87,89,153,167,168,170,174,176-179,182,184] The outcomes examined were  symptomatic norovirus infection, inactivation of human norovirus, and  inactivation of FCV.  Evidence for  efficacy against norovirus was usually based on studies using FCV as a  surrogate. However, FCV and norovirus exhibit different physiochemical  properties and it is unclear whether inactivation of FCV reflects efficacy  against human strains of norovirus.  One  systematic review[153] and 14 descriptive studies[63,83,87,89,167,168,170,174,176-179,182,184] outlined strategies for containing  environmental bioburden.  The majority of  outbreaks were managed with sodium hypochlorite in various concentrations as  the primary disinfectant.  The  concentrations for environmental cleaning among these studies ranged from 0.1%  to 6.15% sodium hypochlorite.  </p>
                        <p>There  was found moderate quality evidence to examine the impact of disinfection  agents on human norovirus inactivation.[187,194,201]   Three basic science studies evaluated the virucidal effects of select  disinfectants against norovirus.[187,194,201]   A decline of 3 in the log<sup>10</sup> of human norovirus exposed to disinfectants  in the presence of fecal material, a fetal bovine serum protein load, or both  was achieved with 5% organic acid after 60 minutes of contact time, 6000 ppm  free chlorine with 15 minutes of contact time, or a 1 or 2% peroxide solution  for 60 minutes.[187]   This study also demonstrated that the range of disinfectants more  readily inactivated FCV than human norovirus samples, suggesting that FCV may  not have equivalent physical properties to those of human norovirus.  One basic science study demonstrated a  procedure to eliminate norovirus (genogroup II) from a melamine substrate using  a two step process - a cleaning step to remove gross fecal material, followed  by a 5000-ppm hypochlorite product with a one minute contact time.[194]   Cleaning with a detergent, or using a disinfectant alone failed to  eliminate the virus.</p>
                        <p>Moderate  quality evidence was available on the impact of disinfection agents on the  human norovirus surrogate, FCV.[185,187,188,190-192,198-200] Nine basic science studies evaluated  the activity of several disinfectants agents against FCV.[185,187,188,190-192,198-200]   Only a single study showed equivalent efficacy between a quaternary  ammonium compound and 1000 ppm hypochlorite on non-porous surfaces.[188]   In contrast, selected quaternary ammonium based-products, ethanol, and a  1% anionic detergent were all unable to inactivate FCV beyond a reduction of  1.25 in the log<sup>10</sup> of virus, compared to 1000 ppm and 5000 ppm hypochlorite,  0.8% iodine, and 0.5% glutaraldehyde products.200   4% organic acid, 1% peroxide, and &gt;2% aldehyde products showed  inactivation of FCV but only with impractical contact times exceeding 1 hour.[187]  </p>
                        <p>Studies  of disinfecting non-porous surfaces and hands evaluated the efficacy of varying  dilutions of ethanol and isopropanol and determined that 70-90% ethanol was  more efficacious at inactivating FCV compared to isopropanol, but unable to  achieve a reduction of 3 in the log<sup>10</sup> of the viral titer (99.9%), even after 10  minutes of contact.[191]   Other studies have shown that combinations of phenolic and quaternary  ammonium compounds and peroxyacetic acid were only effective against FCV if  they exceeded the manufacturers’ recommended concentrations by a factor of 2 to  4.[199]   The included basic science studies agents demonstrating complete  inactivation of FCV were those containing hypochlorite, glutaraldehyde,  hydrogen peroxide, iodine, or &gt;5% sodium bicarbonate active ingredients.  Not all of these products are feasible for  use in healthcare settings.  </p>
                        <p>In  applications to various fabrics (100% cotton, 100% polyester, and cotton  blends), FCV was inactivated completely by 2.6% glutaraldehyde, and showed  &gt;90% reductions of FCV titers when phenolics, 2.5% or 10% sodium  bicarbonate, or 70% isopropanol were evaluated.190   In carpets consisting of olefin, polyester, nylon, or blends, 2.6%  glutaraldehyde demonstrated &gt;99.7% inactivation of FCV, with other  disinfectants showing moderate to modest reductions in FCV titers.[190]   The experimental use of monochloramine as an alternative disinfectant to  free chlorine in water treatment systems only demonstrated modest reductions in  viral titer after 3 hours of contact time.   The literature search did not evaluate publications using newer methods  for environmental disinfection, such as ozone mist from a humidifying device,  fumigation, UV irradiation, and fogging.      </p>
                        <p>This  search strategy was unable to find well-designed studies that compared  virucidal efficacy of products on human norovirus, FCV, or other surrogate  models among commonly used hospital disinfectants agents to establish practical  standards, conditions, concentrations, and contact times.  Ongoing laboratory studies are now exploring  murine models as a surrogate that may exhibit greater similarity to human  norovirus than FCV.  Forthcoming research  using this animal model may provide clearer direction regarding which  disinfectants reduce norovirus environmental contamination from healthcare  environments, while balancing occupational safety issues with the practicality  of efficient and ready-to-use products. </p>

</p>

<p>
3.C.9.a Begin active case-finding when a cluster of acute gastroenteritis cases is detected in the healthcare facility.  Use a specified case definition, and implement line lists to track both exposed and symptomatic patients and staff.  Collect relevant epidemiological, clinical, and demographic data as well as information on patient location and outcomes. <strong>(Category&nbsp;IB)</strong>(<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>)   
</p>

<p>
3.C.9.b As with all outbreaks, notify appropriate local and state health departments, as required by state and local public health regulations, if an outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis is suspected.  <strong>(Category IC)</strong>  (<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>)
</p>

<p>
3.C.10 Develop written policies that specify the chains of communication needed to manage and report outbreaks of norovirus gastroenteritis.  Key stakeholders such as clinical staff, environmental services, laboratory administration, healthcare facility administration and public affairs, as well as state or local public health authorities, should be included in the framework.  <strong>(Category&nbsp;IB)</strong>(<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>)
</p>

<p>
3.C.10.a  Provide timely communication to personnel and visitors when an outbreak of norovirus gastroenteritis is identified and outline what policies and provisions need to be followed to prevent further transmission <strong>(Category&nbsp;IB) </strong>(<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>)</p>
<p>3.C.11  Consider limiting transfers to those for which the receiving facility is able to maintain Contact Precautions; otherwise, it may be prudent to postpone transfers until patients no longer require Contact Precautions.  During outbreaks, medically suitable individuals recovering from norovirus gastroenteritis can be discharged to their place of residence.<strong>(Category II)</strong>  (<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>) </p>
<p>
3.C.12.a  Clean and disinfect shared equipment between patients using EPA-registered products with label claims for use in healthcare.

<p>
3.C.12.d.1 Consider avoiding the use of upholstered furniture and rugs or carpets in patient care areas, as these objects are difficult to clean and disinfect completely.  If this option is not possible, immediately clean soilage, such as emesis or fecal material, from upholstery, using a manufacturer-approved cleaning agent or detergent.  Opt for seating in patient-care areas that can withstand routine cleaning and disinfection. <strong>(Category II)</strong>  (<a href="013_norovirus-evidence-q3.html#q3c">Key Question 3C</a>)
</p>

<p>
3.C.12.d.2 Consider steam cleaning of upholstered furniture in patient rooms upon discharge.  Consult with manufacturer's recommendations for cleaning and disinfection of these items.
