<p>Since 2002, 4 states have enacted legislation that requires health care organizations to publicly disclose health care&ndash;associated
  infection (HAI) rates. Similar legislative efforts are underway in several other states. Advocates of mandatory public reporting of
  HAIs believe that making such information publicly available will enable consumers to make more informed choices about their
  health care and improve overall health care quality by reducing HAIs. Further, they believe that patients have a right to know this
  information. However, others have expressed concern that the reliability of public reporting systems may be compromised by
  institutional variability in the definitions used for HAIs, or in the methods and resources used to identify HAIs. Presently, there is
  insufficient evidence on the merits and limitations of an HAI public reporting system. Therefore, the Healthcare Infection Control
  Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) has not recommended for or against mandatory public reporting of HAI rates. However,
  HICPAC has developed this guidance document based on established principles for public health and HAI reporting systems. This
  document is intended to assist policymakers, program planners, consumer advocacy organizations, and others tasked with
  designing and implementing public reporting systems for HAIs. The document provides a framework for legislators, but does not
  provide model legislation. HICPAC recommends that persons who design and implement such systems 1) use established public
  health surveillance methods when designing and implementing mandatory HAI reporting systems; 2) create multidisciplinary
  advisory panels, including persons with expertise in the prevention and control of HAIs, to monitor the planning and oversight of
  HAI public reporting systems; 3) choose appropriate process and outcome measures based on facility type and phase in measures
  to allow time for facilities to adapt and to permit ongoing evaluation of data validity; and 4) provide regular and confidential
  feedback of performance data to healthcare providers. Specifically, HICPAC recommends that states establishing public reporting
  systems for HAIs select one or more of the following process or outcome measures as appropriate for hospitals or long-term care
  facilities in their jurisdictions: 1) central-line insertion practices; 2) surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis; 3) influenza vaccination
  coverage among patients and healthcare personnel; 4) central line-associated bloodstream infections; and 5) surgical site infections
  following selected operations. HICPAC will update these recommendations as more research and experience become available.
  (Am J Infect Control 2005;33:217-26.)</p>
<p>Consumer demand for health care information,
including data about the performance of health care
providers, has increased steadily over the past decade.
Many state and national initiatives are underway to
mandate or induce health care organizations to publicly
disclose information regarding institutional and
physician performance. Mandatory public reporting of
health care performance is intended to enable stakeholders,
including consumers, to make more informed
choices on health care issues.</p>
<p>Public reporting of health care performance information
  has taken several forms. Health care performance
  reports (report cards and honor rolls) typically
  describe the outcomes of medical care in terms of
  mortality, selected complications, or medical errors
  and, to a lesser extent, economic outcomes. Increasingly,
  process measures (ie, measurement of adherence
  to recommended health care practices, such as hand
  hygiene) are being used as an indicator of how well an organization adheres to established standards of practice
with the implicit assumption that good processes
lead to good health care outcomes. National health care
quality improvement initiatives, notably those of the
Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations (JCAHO), the Centers for Medicare &amp;
Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Hospital Quality
Alliance, use process measures in their public reporting
initiatives.</p>
<p>Health care&ndash;associated infections (HAIs) are infections
that patients acquire during the course of receiving
treatment for other conditions (see Appendix 1 for
full definition of this and other terms used in this
document). In hospitals alone, HAIs account for an
estimated 2 million infections, 90,000 deaths, and $4.5
billion in excess health care costs annually1; however,
few of the existing report cards on hospital performance
use HAIs as a quality indicator. Since 2002, 4
states (Illinois, Pennsylvania, Missouri, and Florida)
have enacted legislation mandating hospitals and
health care organizations to publicly disclose HAI
rates. Similar legislative efforts are underway in several
other states.</p>
<p>
Because of the increasing legislative and regulatory
interest in this area, the Healthcare Infection Control
Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) conducted a
scientific literature review to evaluate the merits and
limitations of HAI reporting systems.We found no published
information on the effectiveness of public reporting
systems in reducing HAIs. Therefore, HICPAC has
concluded that there is insufficient evidence at this time
to recommend for or against public reporting of HAIs.</p>
<p>
However, to assist those who will be tasked with
designing and implementing such reporting systems,
HICPAC presents the following framework for an HAI
reporting system and recommendations for process
and outcome measures to be included in the system.
The framework and recommendations are based on
established principles for public health and HAI
surveillance. This document is intended primarily for
policymakers, program planners, consumer advocacy
organizations, and others who will be developing and
maintaining public reporting systems for HAI. The
document does not provide model legislation.</p>
<p>
This document represents the consensus opinion of
HICPAC. HICPAC is a federal advisory committee that
was established in 1991 to provide advice and guidance
to the Department of Health and Human Services and
CDC regarding surveillance, prevention, and control
of HAIs and related events in healthcare settings
(<a href="../index.html">www.cdc.gov/HICPAC</a>/).These recommendations
also have been endorsed by the
Association for Professionals in Infection Control and
Epidemiology, the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology
of America. These recommendations
also have been endorsed by the
Association for Professionals in Infection Control and
Epidemiology, the Council of State and Territorial
Epidemiologists, and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America. These recommendations will be
updated as new information becomes available.</p>

                  <h3> Essential Elements Of A Public
Reporting System For HAIs                  </h3>
                    <p>As a first step, the goals, objectives, and priorities of a
public reporting system should be clearly specified and
the information to be monitored should be measurable
to ensure that the system can be held accountable by
stakeholders. The reporting system should collect and
report healthcare data that are useful not only to the
public, but also to the facility for its quality improvement
efforts. This can be achieved by selection of
appropriate measures and patient populations to monitor;
use of standardized case-finding methods and data
validity checks; adequate support for infrastructure,
resources, and infection control professionals; adjustment
for underlying infection risk; and production of
useful and accessible reports for stakeholders, with
feedback to healthcare providers. The planning and
oversight of the system should be monitored by a
multidisciplinary group composed of public health
officials, consumers, health care providers, and health
care infection control professionals.                    </p>
                    <p class="topOPage"><a href="publicReportingHAI.html#">Top of Page</a></p>  
                    
                     <a name="a2" id="a2"></a>	
                      <h3>Identifying Appropriate Measures of Health Care Performance</h3>
                   
<p>Monitoring both process and outcome measures and
assessing their correlation is a comprehensive approach
to quality improvement. Standardized process
and outcome measures for national health care performance
for hospitals, nursing homes, and other
settings have been endorsed through the National
Quality Forum (NQF) voluntary consensus process.2-4
NQF also has developed a model policy on the
endorsement of proprietary performance measures.5
Several other agencies and organizations, including
CDC, CMS, the Agency for Healthcare Quality and
Research, JCAHO, the Leapfrog organization, and the
National Committee for Quality Assurance, also have
developed health care quality measures. Health care
performance reports should identify the sources and
endorsers of the measures and the sources of the data
used (eg, administrative or clinical).</p>
<p><strong>Process measures. </strong>Process measures are desirable
  for inclusion in a public reporting system because the
  target adherence rate of 100% to these practices is
  unambiguous. Furthermore, process measures do not
  require adjustment for the patient's underlying risk
  of infection. Process measures that are selected for
  inclusion in a public reporting system should be
  those that measure common practices, are valid for a
  variety of health care settings (eg, small, rural versus
  large, urban hospitals); and can be clearly specified (eg, appropriate exclusion and inclusion criteria). Process
measures meeting these criteria include adherence
rates of central line insertion practices and
surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis and coverage rates
of influenza vaccination for health care personnel and
patients/residents (<a href="prg_tbl1.html">Table 1</a>). Collection of data on one or
more of these process measures already is recommended
by the NQF and required by CMS and JCAHO for
their purposes.
Outcome measures. Outcome measures should be
chosen for reporting based on the frequency, severity,
and preventability of the outcomes and the likelihood
that they can be detected and reported accurately.14
Outcome measures meeting these criteria include
central line&ndash;associated, laboratory-confirmed primary
bloodstream infections (CLA-LCBI) in intensive care
units (ICU) and surgical site infections (SSI) following
selected operations (<a href="prg_tbl2.html">Table 2</a>). Although CLA-LCBIs and
SSIs occur at relatively low rates, they are associated
with substantial morbidity and mortality and excess
health care costs. Also, there are well-established
prevention strategies for CLA-LCBIs and SSIs.6,10 Therefore,
highest priority should be given to monitoring
these two HAIs and providers' adherence to the related
processes of care (ie, central-line insertion practices
for CLA-LCBI and surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis
for SSIs).</p>
<p>Use of other HAIs in public reporting systems may
  be more difficult. For example, catheter-associated
  urinary tract infections, though they may occur more
  frequently than CLA-LCBIs or SSIs, are associated with a
  lower morbidity and mortality; therefore, monitoring
  these infections likely has less prevention effectiveness
  relative to the burden of data collection and reporting.
  On the other hand, HAIs such as ventilator-associated
  pneumonia, which occur relatively infrequently but
  have substantial morbidity and mortality, are difficult
  to detect accurately. Including such HAIs in a reporting
  system may result in invalid comparisons of infection
  rates and be misleading to consumers.  </p>
<p>Monitoring of process and outcome measures should
  be phased in gradually to allow time for facilities to
  adapt and to permit ongoing evaluation of data validity. </p>

<h3> Identifying Patient Populations for Monitoring </h3>
  
  <p>CDC16 and other authorities17 no longer recommend
collection or reporting of hospital-wide overall HAI
rates because 1) HAI rates are low in many hospital
locations (which makes routine inclusion of these units
unhelpful), 2) collecting hospital-wide data is labor
intensive and may divert resources from prevention
activities, and 3) methods for hospital-wide risk adjustment
have not been developed. Rather than hospitalwide
rates, reporting rates of specific HAI for specific hospital units or operation-specific rates of SSIs is
recommended.16 This practice can help ensure that
data collection is concentrated in populations where
HAIs are more frequent and that rates are calculated
that are more useful for targeting prevention and
making comparisons among facilities or within facilities
over time.  </p>   
  <p class="topOPage"><a href="publicReportingHAI.html#">Top of Page</a></p>  
  
   <a name="a4" id="a4"></a>
  <h3> 
Case-Finding</h3>
  
  <p>Once the population at risk for HAIs has been
identified, standardized methods for case-finding
should be adopted. Such methods help to reduce
surveillance bias (ie, the finding of higher rates at
institutions that do a more complete job of casefinding).
Incentives to find cases of HAI may be helpful.
Conversely, punitive measures for hospitals that report
high rates may encourage underreporting.</p>
  <p>Traditional case-finding methods for HAIs include
    review of medical records, laboratory reports, and
    antibiotic administration records. However, these standard
    case-finding methods can be enhanced. For
    example, substantially more SSIs are found when
    administrative data sources (eg, International Classification
    of Diseases, 9th Revision [ICD-9], discharge
    codes) are used in combination with antimicrobial
    receipt to flag charts for careful review.18,19 However,
    the accuracy of case-finding using ICD-9 codes alone
    likely varies by HAI type and by hospital. Therefore,
    ICD-9 discharge codes should not be relied upon as the
    sole source of case finding for HAI monitoring systems.</p>
  <p>Traditional HAI case-finding methods were developed
    in an era when patients' lengths of hospitalization
    were much longer than they are today, allowing most
    HAIs to be detected during the hospital stay. However,
    for SSIs in particular, the current climate of short stays
    and rapid transfers to other facilities makes accurate
    detection difficult because as many as 50% of SSIs
    do not become evident until after hospital discharge
    or transfer.20 Since there is no consensus on which
    postdischarge surveillance methods are the most
    accurate and practical for detection of SSIs,10 the
    limitations of current case-finding methods should be
    recognized if SSIs are selected for inclusion in mandatory
    reporting systems. </p>

  <h3>
Validation of Data </h3>
  
  <p>A method to validate data should be considered in
any mandatory reporting system to ensure that HAIs
are being accurately and completely reported and that
rates are comparable from hospital to hospital or
among all hospitals in the reporting system. The
importance of validation was emphasized by a CDC
study of the accuracy of reporting to the NNIS system,
which found that although hospitals identified and reported most of the HAIs that occurred, the accuracy
varied by infection site.15  </p>

   <a name="a6" id="a6"></a>  
  <h3>
Resources and Infrastructure Needed for a Reporting System </h3>
  
  <p>A reporting system can not produce quality data
without adequate resources. At the institution level,
trained personnel with dedicated time are required,
eg, infection control professionals to conduct HAI
surveillance. At the system level, key infrastructure includes instruction manuals, training materials, data
collection forms, methods for data entry and submission,
databases to receive and aggregate the data,
appropriate quality checks, computer programs for
data analysis, and standardized reports for dissemination
of results. Computer resources within reporting
systems must include both hardware and software
and a standard user interface. In order to collect
detailed data on factors such as use of invasive
devises (eg, central lines), patient care location within
the facility, type of operation, and extensive data dictionaries and coding schema must be developed
and maintained.  </p> 
  <p class="topOPage"><a href="publicReportingHAI.html#">Top of Page</a></p>    
  
   <a name="a7" id="a7"></a>
  <h3>
HAI Rates and Risk Adjustment </h3>
  
  <p>For optimal comparison purposes, HAI rates should
be adjusted for the potential differences in risk factors.  </p>
  <p>For example, in the NNIS system, device-associated
infections are risk adjusted by calculating rates per
1,000 device-days (eg, CLA-LCBI per 1,000 central
line&ndash;days) and stratifying by unit type.21-23 For that
system, risk adjustment of SSIs is done by calculating of
operation-specific rates stratified by a standardized risk
index.23-25 Although these methods do not incorporate all potential confounding variables, they provide an
acceptable level of risk adjustment that avoids the data
collection burden thatwould be required to adjust for all
variables.</p>
  <p>Risk adjustment is labor intensive because data must
    be collected on the entire population at risk (the
    denominator) rather than only the fraction with HAIs
    (the numerator). Risk adjustment can not correct for
    variability among data collectors in the accuracy of
    finding and reporting events. Further, current riskadjustment
    methods improve but do not guarantee the
    validity of inter-hospital comparisons, especially comparisons
    involving facilities with diverse patient populations
    (eg, community versus tertiary-care hospitals).    </p>
  <p>Valid event rates are facilitated by selecting events
    that occur frequently enough and at-risk populations
    that are large enough to produce adequate sample
    sizes. Unfortunately, use of stratification (eg, calculation
    of rates separately in multiple categories) for risk
    adjustment may lead to small numbers of HAIs in any
    one category and thereby yield unstable rates, as is the
    case of a small hospital with low surgical volume.</p>
    <p class="topOPage"><a href="publicReportingHAI.html#">Top of Page</a></p>  
    
     <a name="a8" id="a8"></a>
  <h3>
Producing Useful Reports and Feedback</h3>
  
  <p>Publicly released reports must convey scientific
meaning in a manner that is useful and interpretable
to a diverse audience. Collaboration between subject
matter experts, statisticians, and communicators is
necessary in developing these reports. The reports
should provide useful information to the various users
and highlight potential limitations of both the data and
the methods used for risk adjustment. In a new
reporting system, data should be examined and validated
before initial release; in addition, sufficient
sample size should be accumulated so that rates are
stable at the time of public release. Lastly, feedback of
performance data should be given to health care
providers regularly so that interventions to improve
performance can be implemented as quickly as possible.
For example, feedback of SSI rates to surgeons has
been shown to be an important component of strategies
to reduce SSI risk.26  </p>

  <h3> 
Adapting Established Methods for Use In Mandatory Reporting Systems </h3>
  
  <p>Where appropriate, developers of reporting systems
should avail themselves of established and proven
methods of collecting and reporting surveillance data.
For example, many of the methods, attributes, and
protocols of CDC's NNIS system may be applicable for
public reporting systems. A detailed description of the
NNIS methodologies has been described elsewhere, 23
and additional information on NNIS is available at
    <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/">www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/surveill/nnis.htm</a>.  </p>
  <p>Most reporting systems, such as NNIS, use manual
data collection methods. In most instances, information
in computer databases, when available, can be
substituted for manually collected data.27,28 However,
when manual data collection is necessary, alternate
approaches include limiting reporting to well-defined
and readily identifiable events, using simpler and more
objective event definitions,29 and sampling to obtain
denominators.30 These approaches could decrease the
burden of data collection and improve the consistency
of reporting among facilities. If data collection were
simplified, expanding the number of infection types
and locations in which they are monitored may
become more feasible.</p>

  <h3>
Potential Consequences of Mandatory Public Reporting Systems</h3>
  
  <p>Mandatory reporting of HAIs will provide consumers
and stakeholders with additional information for
making informed health care choices. Further, reports
from private systems suggest that participation in an
organized, ongoing system for monitoring and reporting
of HAIs may reduce HAI rates.31,32 This same
beneficial consequence may apply to mandatory public
reporting systems. Conversely, as with voluntary
private reporting, mandatory public reporting that
doesn't incorporate sound surveillance principles and
reasonable goals may divert resources to reporting
infections and collecting data for risk adjustment and
away from patient care and prevention; such reporting
also could result in unintended disincentives to treat
patients at higher risk for HAI. In addition, current
standard methods for HAI surveillance were developed
for voluntary use and may need to be modified for
mandatory reporting. Lastly, publicly reported HAI
rates can mislead stakeholders if inaccurate information
is disseminated. Therefore, in a mandatory public
report of HAI information, the limitations of current
methods should be clearly communicated within the
publicly released report.  </p>

    <h3> 
Research and Evaluation Needs</h3>
  
  <p>Research and evaluation of existing and future
HAI reporting systems will be needed to answer questions
about 1) the comparative effectiveness and efficiency
of public and private reporting systems and
2) the incidence and prevention of unintended consequences.
Ongoing evaluation of each system will be
needed to confirm the appropriateness of the methods
used and the validity of the results.  </p>

  <h3>
Recommendations </h3>
  
  <p>The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory
Committee proposes four overarching recommendations regarding the mandatory public reporting of HAIs.
These recommendations are intended to guide policymakers
in the creation of statewide reporting systems
for health care facilities in their jurisdictions.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Use established public health surveillance methods
      when designing and implementing mandatory HAI
      reporting systems. This process involves:
      <ol>
        <li> selection of appropriate process and outcome
      measures to monitor;      </li>
        <li>selection of appropriate patient populations to
          monitor;          </li>
        <li> use of standardized case-finding methods and
          data validity checks;          </li>
        <li> provision of adequate support and resources;          </li>
        <li>adjustment for underlying infection risk; and          </li>
        <li> production of useful and accessible reports to
          stakeholders.<br />
          <br />

          
          <em>Do not use hospital discharge diagnostic codes as the
          sole data source for HAI public reporting systems.</em></li>
      </ol>
       </li>
    <li> Create a multidisciplinary advisory panel to monitor
      the planning and oversight of the operations and
      products of HAI public reporting systems. This team
      should include persons with expertise in the prevention
      and control of HAIs.      </li>
    <li> Choose appropriate process and outcome measures
      based on facility type, and phase in measures
      gradually to allow time for facilities to adapt and
      to permit ongoing evaluation of data validity. States
      can select from the following measures as appropriate
      for hospitals or long term care facilities in
      their jurisdictions.
      <ol>
        <li> Three process measures are appropriate for
      hospitals and one (iii below) is appropriate for
      long term care facilities participating in a mandatory
      HAI reporting system (Table 1).
          <ol>
            <li>Central line insertion practices (with the goal of
      targeting ICU-specific CLA-LCBIs can be measured
      by all hospitals that have the type of ICUs
      selected formonitoring (eg, medical or surgical).</li>
            <li> Surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (with the
              goal of targeting SSI rates) can be measured by
              all hospitals that conduct the operations selected
              for monitoring.</li>
            <li> Influenza vaccination coverage rates for health
              care personnel and patients can be measured
              by all hospitals and long term care facilities. For
              example:
              <ul>
                <li> Coverage rates for health care personnel can
              be measured in all hospitals and long term
              care facilities.</li>
                <li>Coverage rates for high-risk patients can be
                  measured in all hospitals.                  </li>
                <li>Coverage rates for all residents can be
                  measured in all long term care facilities.</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
          </ol>
           </li>
        <li> Two outcome measures are appropriate for
          some hospitals participating in a mandatory HAI
          reporting system (Table 2).
          <ol>
            <li>CLA-LCBIs.          </li>
            <li> SSIs following selected operations.<br />
<br />

              Hospitals for which these measures are appropriate
              are those in which the frequency of the HAI is sufficient
              to achieve statistically stable rates. To foster performance
              improvement, the HAI rate to be reported
              should be coupled with a process measure of adherence
              to the prevention practice known to lower the rate
              (see 3ai and 3aii). For example, hospitals in states
              where reporting of SSIs is mandated should monitor
              and report adherence to recommended standards for
              surgical prophylaxis (see 3aii).</li>
          </ol>
         </li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    <li>Provide regular and confidential feedback of performance
      data to health care providers. This practice
      may encourage low performers to implement
      targeted prevention activities and increase the acceptability
      of the public reporting systems within
      the health care sector.</li>
