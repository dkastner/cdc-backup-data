                  <h1>IV. MDRO Prevention and Control</h1>

<a name="a1" id="a1"></a>
<p><em><strong>Prevention of Infections.</strong></em> Preventing infections will reduce the burden of MDROs in
healthcare settings. Prevention of antimicrobial resistance depends on appropriate clinical
practices that should be incorporated into all routine patient care. These include optimal
management of vascular and urinary catheters, prevention of lower respiratory tract
infection in intubated patients, accurate diagnosis of infectious etiologies, and judicious
antimicrobial selection and utilization. Guidance for these preventive practices include the
Campaign to Reduce Antimicrobial Resistance in Healthcare Settings
(<a href="../../getsmart/healthcare/index.html">www.cdc.gov/getsmart/healthcare/</a>), a multifaceted, evidence-based
approach with four parallel strategies: infection prevention; accurate and prompt diagnosis
and treatment; prudent use of antimicrobials; and prevention of transmission. Campaign
materials are available for acute care hospitals, surgical settings, dialysis units, LTCFs and
pediatric acute care units.</p>
<p>To reduce rates of central-venous-line associated bloodstream infections(CVL-BSIs) and
  ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a group of bundled evidence-based clinical
  practices have been implemented in many U.S. healthcare facilities(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a118">118</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a141">141</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a144">144</a>). One
  report demonstrated a sustained effect on the reduction in CVL-BSI rates with this
  approach(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a145">145</a>). Although the specific effect on MDRO infection and colonization rates have
  not been reported, it is logical that decreasing these and other healthcare-associated
  infections will in turn reduce antimicrobial use and decrease opportunities for emergence
  and transmission of MDROs.</p>
  
  <a name="a2" id="a2"></a>
  <p><strong>Prevention and Control of MDRO transmission</strong></p>
  <a name="a3" id="a3"></a>
<p><em><strong>Overview of the MDRO control literature.</strong></em> Successful control of MDROs has been
documented in the United States and abroad using a variety of combined interventions.
These include improvements in hand hygiene, use of Contact Precautions until patients are
culture-negative for a target MDRO, active surveillance cultures (ASC), education,
enhanced environmental cleaning, and improvements in communication about patients with
MDROs within and between healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>Representative studies include:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Reduced rates of MRSA transmission in The Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and other
    Scandinavian countries after the implementation of aggressive and sustained infection
    control interventions (i.e., ASC; preemptive use of Contact Precautions upon admission
    until proven culture negative; and, in some instances, closure of units to new
    admissions). MRSA generally accounts for a very small proportion of <em>S. aureus</em> clinical
    isolates in these countries(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a146">146</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a150">150</a>).</li>
  <li> Reduced rates of VRE transmission in healthcare facilities in the three-state Siouxland
    region (Iowa, Nebraska, and South Dakota) following formation of a coalition and
    development of an effective region-wide infection control intervention that included ASC
    and isolation of infected patients. The overall prevalence rate of VRE in the 30
    participating facilities decreased from 2.2% in 1997 to 0.5% in 1999(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>).</li>
  <li>Eradication of endemic MRSA infections from two NICUs. The first NICU included
    implementation of ASC, Contact Precautions, use of triple dye on the umbilical cord, and
    systems changes to improve surveillance and adherence to recommended practices and
    to reduce overcrowding(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>). The second NICU used ASC and Contact Precautions;
    surgical masks were included in the barriers used for Contact Precautions(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>).</li>
  <li>Control of an outbreak and eventual eradication of VRE from a burn unit over a 13-
    month period with implementation of aggressive culturing, environmental cleaning, and
    barrier isolation(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a154">154</a>).</li>
  <li> Control of an outbreak of VRE in a NICU over a 3-year period with implementation of
    ASC, other infection control measures such as use of a waterless hand disinfectant, and
    mandatory in-service education(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a155">155</a>). </li>
  <li> Eradication of MDR-strains of A. baumannii from a burn unit over a 16-month period with 
    implementation of strategies to improve adherence to hand hygiene, isolation,
    environmental cleaning, and temporary unit closure(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>).    </li>
  <li>In addition, more than 100 reports published during 1982-2005 support the efficacy of 
    combinations of various control interventions to reduce the burden of MRSA, VRE, and 
    MDR-GNBs (Tables 1 and 2). Case-rate reduction or pathogen eradication was reported 
    in a majority of studies.    </li>
  <li> VRE was eradicated in seven special-care units(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a154">154</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a156">156</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a160">160</a>), two hospitals(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a161">161</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a162">162</a>), 
    and one LTCF(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a163">163</a>).    </li>
  <li>MRSA was eradicated from nine special-care units(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a89">89</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a164">164</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a196">169</a>), two 
    hospitals(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a170">170</a>), one LTCF(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a167">167</a>), and one Finnish district(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a171">171</a>). Furthermore, four MRSA 
    reports described continuing success in sustaining low endemic MDRO rates for over 5 
    years(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a68">68</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a166">166</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a172">172</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a173">173</a>).    </li>
  <li>An MDR-GNB was eradicated from 13 special-care units(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a8">8</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a9">9</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a174">174</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a180">180</a>) and two 
    hospitals (<a href="mdro_reference.html#a11">11</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a181">181</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>  These success stories testify to the importance of having dedicated and knowledgeable 
  teams of healthcare professionals who are willing to persist for years, if necessary, to 
  control MDROs. Eradication and control of MDROs, such as those reported, frequently 
  required periodic reassessment and the addition of new and more stringent interventions 
  over time (tiered strategy). For example, interventions were added in a stepwise fashion 
  during a 3-year effort that eventually eradicated MRSA from an NICU(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>). A series of 
  interventions was adopted throughout the course of a year to eradicate VRE from a burn 
  unit(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a154">154</a>). Similarly, eradication of carbapenem-resistant strains of A. baumannii from a 
  hospital required multiple and progressively more intense interventions over several 
  years(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a11">11</a>).</p>
<p> Nearly all studies reporting successful MDRO control employed a median of 7 to 8 different 
  interventions concurrently or sequentially (<a href="mdro_table1.html">Table 1</a>). These figures may underestimate the 
  actual number of control measures used, because authors of these reports may have 
  considered their earliest efforts routine (e.g., added emphasis on handwashing), and did not 
  include them as interventions, and some &quot;single measures&quot; are, in fact, a complex combination of several interventions. The use of multiple concurrent control measures in
these reports underscores the need for a comprehensive approach for controlling MDROs.</p>
<p>Several factors affect the ability to generalize the results of the various studies reviewed,
  including differences in definition, study design, endpoints and variables measured, and
  period of follow-up. Two-thirds of the reports cited in Tables 1 and 2 involved perceived
  outbreaks, and one-third described efforts to reduce endemic transmission. Few reports
  described preemptive efforts or prospective studies to control MDROs before they had
  reached high levels within a unit or facility.  </p>
<p>With these and other factors, it has not been possible to determine the effectiveness of
  individual interventions, or a specific combination of interventions, that would be appropriate
  for all healthcare facilities to implement in order to control their target MDROs. Randomized
  controlled trials are necessary to acquire this level of evidence. An NIH-sponsored,
  randomized controlled trial on the prevention of MRSA and VRE transmission in adult ICUs
  is ongoing and may provide further insight into optimal control measures
  (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1</a>). This trial compares the use of
  education (to improve adherence to hand hygiene) and Standard Precautions to the use of
  ASC and Contact Precautions.  </p>
<a name="a4" id="a4"></a>
<p><em><strong>Control Interventions. </strong></em>The various types of interventions used to control or eradicate
  MDROs may be grouped into seven categories. These include administrative support,
  judicious use of antimicrobials, surveillance (routine and enhanced), Standard and Contact
  Precautions, environmental measures, education and decolonization. These interventions
  provide the basis for the recommendations for control of MDROs in healthcare settings that
  follow this review and as summarized in <a href="mdro_table3.html">Table 3</a>. In the studies reviewed, these
  interventions were applied in various combinations and degrees of intensity, with differences
  in outcome.  </p>
    <a name="a5" id="a5"></a>
<ol>
  <li><strong> Administrative support.</strong> In several reports, administrative support and involvement
    were important for the successful control of the target MDRO(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a3">3</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a182">182-185</a>), and
    authorities in infection control have strongly recommended such support(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a2">2</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a106">106</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a186">186</a>). There are several examples of MDRO control interventions that require
administrative commitment of fiscal and human resources. One is the use of ASC(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a8">8</a>,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a68">68</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a114">114</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a167">167</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a168">168</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a183">183</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a187">187</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a192">192</a>). Other interventions that
require administrative support include: 1) implementing system changes to ensure
prompt and effective communications e.g., computer alerts to identify patients
previously known to be colonized/infected with MDROs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a189">189</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a193">193, 194</a>); <a href="mdro_reference.html#a2">2</a>),
providing the necessary number and appropriate placement of hand washing sinks
and alcohol-containing hand rub dispensers in the facility(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a106">106</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a195">195</a>); 3) maintaining
staffing levels appropriate to the intensity of care required(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a196">196-202</a>); and 4)
enforcing adherence to recommended infection control practices (e.g., hand hygiene,
Standard and Contact Precautions) for MDRO control. Other measures that have
been associated with a positive impact on prevention efforts, that require
administrative support, are direct observation with feedback to HCP on adherence to
recommended precautions and keeping HCP informed about changes in
transmission rates(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a3">3</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a182">182</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a203">203-205</a>). A &quot;How-to guide&quot; for implementing change
in ICUs, including analysis of structure, process, and outcomes when designing
interventions, can assist in identification of needed administrative interventions(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a195">195</a>).
Lastly, participation in existing, or the creation of new, city-wide, state-wide, regional
or national coalitions, to combat emerging or growing MDRO problems is an effective
strategy that requires administrative support(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a146">146</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a167">167</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a188">188</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a206">206</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a207">207</a>).</li>
  
  <li><a name="a6" id="a6"></a><em><strong> Education.</strong></em> Facility-wide, unit-targeted, and informal, educational interventions were
included in several successful studies(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a3">3</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a189">189</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a193">193</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a208">208-211</a>). The focus of the
interventions was to encourage a behavior change through improved understanding
of the problem MDRO that the facility was trying to control. Whether the desired
change involved hand hygiene, antimicrobial prescribing patterns, or other outcomes,
enhancing understanding and creating a culture that supported and promoted the
desired behavior, were viewed as essential to the success of the intervention.
Educational campaigns to enhance adherence to hand hygiene practices in
conjunction with other control measures have been associated temporally with
decreases in MDRO transmission in various healthcare settings(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a3">3</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a106">106</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a163">163</a>).</li>
  
  <li><a name="a7" id="a7"></a><strong> Judicious use of antimicrobial agents.</strong> While a comprehensive review of
antimicrobial stewardship is beyond the scope of this guideline, recommendations for
control of MDROs must include attention to judicious antimicrobial use. A temporal
association between formulary changes and decreased occurrence of a target MDRO
was found in several studies, especially in those that focused on MDR-GNBs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a98">98</a>,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a177">177</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a209">209</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a212">212-218</a>). Occurrence of C. difficile-associated disease has also been
associated with changes in antimicrobial use(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a219">219</a>). Although some MRSA and VRE
control efforts have attempted to limit antimicrobial use, the relative importance of this
measure for controlling these MDROs remains unclear(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a193">193, 220</a>). Limiting
antimicrobial use alone may fail to control resistance due to a combination of factors;
including 1) the relative effect of antimicrobials on providing initial selective pressure,
compared to perpetuating resistance once it has emerged; 2) inadequate limits on
usage; or 3) insufficient time to observe the impact of this intervention. With the intent
of addressing #2 and #3 above in the study design, one study demonstrated a
decrease in the prevalence of VRE associated with a formulary switch from ticarcillinclavulanate
to piperacillin-tazobactam(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a221">221</a>).
<p>The CDC Campaign to Prevent Antimicrobial Resistance that was launched in 2002
provides evidence-based principles for judicious use of antimicrobials and tools for
implementation(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a222">222</a>) <a href="../../getsmart/healthcare/index.html">www.cdc.gov/getsmart/healthcare/</a>. This effort targets all
healthcare settings and focuses on effective antimicrobial treatment of infections, use
of narrow spectrum agents, treatment of infections and not contaminants, avoiding
excessive duration of therapy, and restricting use of broad-spectrum or more potent
antimicrobials to treatment of serious infections when the pathogen is not known or
when other effective agents are unavailable. Achieving these objectives would likely
diminish the selective pressure that favors proliferation of MDROs. Strategies for
influencing antimicrobial prescribing patterns within healthcare facilities include
education; formulary restriction; prior-approval programs, including pre-approved
indications; automatic stop orders; academic interventions to counteract
pharmaceutical influences on prescribing patterns; antimicrobial cycling(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a223">223-226</a>); computer-assisted management programs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a227">227-229</a>); and active efforts to remove
redundant antimicrobial combinations(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a223">230</a>). A systematic review of controlled studies
identified several successful practices. These include social marketing (i.e. consumer
education), practice guidelines, authorization systems, formulary restriction,
mandatory consultation, and peer review and feedback. It further suggested that
online systems that provide clinical information, structured order entry, and decision
support are promising strategies(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a231">231</a>). These changes are best accomplished
through an organizational, multidisciplinary, antimicrobial management program(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a232">232</a>).</p>

  <li><a name="a8" id="a8"></a><em><strong>MDRO surveillance.</strong></em> Surveillance is a critically important component of any MDRO
control program, allowing detection of newly emerging pathogens, monitoring
epidemiologic trends, and measuring the effectiveness of interventions. Multiple
MDRO surveillance strategies have been employed, ranging from surveillance of
clinical microbiology laboratory results obtained as part of routine clinical care, to use
of ASC to detect asymptomatic colonization. <br />&nbsp;<br />


 
 <p><a name="a9" id="a9"></a><em><strong>Surveillance for MDROs isolated from routine clinical cultures.<br />
Antibiograms.</strong></em> The simplest form of MDRO surveillance is monitoring of clinical
microbiology isolates resulting from tests ordered as part of routine clinical care. This
method is particularly useful to detect emergence of new MDROs not previously
detected, either within an individual healthcare facility or community-wide. In addition,
this information can be used to prepare facility- or unit-specific summary antimicrobial
susceptibility reports that describe pathogen-specific prevalence of resistance among
clinical isolates. Such reports may be useful to monitor for changes in known
resistance patterns that might signal emergence or transmission of MDROs, and also
to provide clinicians with information to guide antimicrobial prescribing practices(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a233">233-
235</a>).</p>

 <p> <a name="a10" id="a10"></a><em><strong>MDRO Incidence Based on Clinical Culture Results.</strong></em> Some investigators have
used clinical microbiology results to calculate measures of incidence of MDRO
isolates in specific populations or patient care locations (e.g. new MDRO isolates/1,000 patient days, new MDRO isolates per month)(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a205">205</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a236">236</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a237">237</a>). Such
measures may be useful for monitoring MDRO trends and assessing the impact of
prevention programs, although they have limitations. Because they are based solely
on positive culture results without accompanying clinical information, they do not
distinguish colonization from infection, and may not fully demonstrate the burden of
MDRO-associated disease. Furthermore, these measures do not precisely measure
acquisition of MDRO colonization in a given populaton or location. Isolating an
MDRO from a clinical culture obtained from a patient several days after admission to
a given unit or facility does not establish that the patient acquired colonization in that
unit. On the other hand, patients who acquire MDRO colonization may remain
undetected by clinical cultures(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>). Despite these limitations, incidence measures
based on clinical culture results may be highly correlated with actual MDRO
transmission rates derived from information using ASC, as demonstrated in a recent
multicenter study(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a237">237</a>). These results suggest that incidence measures based on
clinical cultures alone might be useful surrogates for monitoring changes in MDRO
transmission rates.</p>
 
<p><a name="a11" id="a11"></a><em><strong>MDRO Infection Rates.</strong></em> Clinical cultures can also be used to identify targeted MDRO
infections in certain patient populations or units(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a238">238, 239</a>). This strategy requires
investigation of clinical circumstances surrounding a positive culture to distinguish
colonization from infection, but it can be particularly helpful in defining the clinical
impact of MDROs within a facility.</p>

<p><a name="a12" id="a12"></a>
<em><strong>Molecular typing of MDRO isolates. </strong></em>Many investigators have used molecular
typing of selected isolates to confirm clonal transmission to enhance understanding
of MDRO transmission and the effect of interventions within their facility(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a68">68</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a89">89</a>,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a92">92</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a138">138</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a190">190</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a193">193</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a236">236</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a240">240</a>).</p>

<p><a name="a13" id="a13"></a>
<em><strong>Surveillance for MDROs by Detecting Asymptomatic Colonization</strong></em>
Another form of MDRO surveillance is the use of active surveillance cultures (ASC) to
identify patients who are colonized with a targeted MDRO(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a241">241</a>). This approach is based upon the observation that, for some MDROs, detection of
colonization may be delayed or missed completely if culture results obtained in the
course of routine clinical care are the primary means of identifying colonized
patients(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a8">8</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a114">114</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a167">167</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a168">168</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a183">183</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a187">187</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a189">189</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a191">191</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a193">193</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a242">242-244</a>).
Several authors report having used ASC when new pathogens emerge in order to
define the epidemiology of the particular agent(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a22">22, 23</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a190">190</a>). In addition, the
authors of several reports have concluded that ASC, in combination with use of
Contact Precautions for colonized patients, contributed directly to the decline or
eradication of the target MDRO(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a68">68</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a217">217</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a242">242</a>). However, not
all studies have reached the same conclusion. Poor control of MRSA despite use of
ASC has been described(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a245">245</a>). A recent study failed to identify cross-transmission of
MRSA or MSSA in a MICU during a 10 week period when ASC were obtained,
despite the fact that culture results were not reported to the staff(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a246">246</a>). The
investigators suggest that the degree of cohorting and adherence to Standard
Precautions might have been the important determinants of transmission prevention,
rather than the use of ASC and Contact Precautions for MRSA-colonized patients.
The authors of a systematic review of the literature on the use of isolation measures
to control healthcare-associated MRSA concluded that there is evidence that
concerted efforts that include ASC and isolation can reduce MRSA even in endemic
settings. However, the authors also noted that methodological weaknesses and
inadequate reporting in published research make it difficult to rule out plausible
alternative explanations for reductions in MRSA acquisition associated with these
interventions, and therefore concluded that the precise contribution of active
surveillance and isolation alone is difficult to assess(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a245">247</a>).</p>
Mathematical modeling studies have been used to estimate the impact of ASC use in
control of MDROs. One such study evaluating interventions to decrease VRE
transmission indicated that use of ASC (versus no cultures) could potentially
decrease transmission 39% and that with pre-emptive isolation plus ASC,
transmission could be decreased 65%(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a248">248</a>). Another mathematical model examining
the use of ASC and isolation for control of MRSA predicted that isolating colonized or infected patients on the basis of clinical culture results is unlikely to be successful at
controlling MRSA, whereas use of active surveillance and isolation can lead to
successful control, even in settings where MRSA is highly endemic.(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a248">249</a>) There is
less literature on the use of ASC in controlling MDR-GNBs. Active surveillance
cultures have been used as part of efforts to successful control of MDR-GNBs in
outbreak settings. The experience with ASC as part of successful control efforts in
endemic settings is mixed. One study reported successful reduction of extendedspectrum
beta-lactamase &ndash;producing Enterobacteriaceae over a six year period
using a multifaceted control program that included use of ASC(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a245">245</a>). Other reports
suggest that use of ASC is not necessary to control endemic MDR-GNBs.(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a250">250, 251</a>).
<p>More research is needed to determine the circumstances under which ASC are most
beneficial(252), but their use should be considered in some settings, especially if
other control measures have been ineffective. When use of ASC is incorporated into
MDRO prevention programs, the following should be considered:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> The decision to use ASC as part of an infection prevention and control program
      requires additional support for successful implementation, including: 1) personnel
      to obtain the appropriate cultures, 2) microbiology laboratory personnel to process
      the cultures, 3) mechanism for communicating results to caregivers, 4) concurrent
      decisions about use of additional isolation measures triggered by a positive
      culture (e.g. Contact Precautions) and 5) mechanism for assuring adherence to
      the additional isolation measures.      </li>
    <li> The populations targeted for ASC are not well defined and vary among published
      reports. Some investigators have chosen to target specific patient populations
      considered at high risk for MDRO colonization based on factors such as location
      (e.g. ICU with high MDRO rates), antibiotic exposure history, presence of
      underlying diseases, prolonged duration of stay, exposure to other MDROcolonized
      patients, patients transferred from other facilities known to have a high
      prevalence of MDRO carriage, or having a history of recent hospital or nursing
      home stays(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a151">151</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a253">253</a>). A more commonly employed strategy involves
      obtaining surveillance cultures from all patients admitted to units experiencing high rates of colonization/infection with the MDROs of interest, unless they are
already known to be MDRO carriers(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a242">242</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a254">254</a>). In an effort to better
define target populations for active surveillance, investigators have attempted to
create prediction rules to identify subpopulations of patients at high risk for
colonization on hospital admission(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a255">255, 256</a>). Decisions about which populations
should be targeted for active surveillance should be made in the context of local
determinations of the incidence and prevalence of MDRO colonization within the
intervention facility as well as other facilities with whom patients are frequently
exchanged(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a257">257</a>).</li>
    <li>Optimal timing and interval of ASC are not well defined. In many reports, cultures
      were obtained at the time of admission to the hospital or intervention unit or at the
      time of transfer to or from designated units (e.g., ICU)(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a107">107</a>). In addition, some
      hospitals have chosen to obtain cultures on a periodic basis [e.g., weekly(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a8">8</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>,
      <a href="mdro_reference.html#a159">159</a>) to detect silent transmission. Others have based follow-up cultures on the
      presence of certain risk factors for MDRO colonization, such as antibiotic
      exposure, exposure to other MDRO colonized patients, or prolonged duration of
      stay in a high risk unit(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a253">253</a>).</li>
    <li> Methods for obtaining ASC must be carefully considered, and may vary
      depending upon the MDRO of interest.
      o MRSA: Studies suggest that cultures of the nares identify most patients
      with MRSA and perirectal and wound cultures can identify additional
      carriers(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a258">258-261</a>).
      <ul>
        <li>VRE: Stool, rectal, or perirectal swabs are generally considered a sensitive
          method for detection of VRE. While one study suggested that rectal swabs
          may identify only 60% of individuals harboring VRE, and may be affected
          by VRE stool density(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a262">262</a>), this observation has not been reported
          elsewhere in the literature.          </li>
        <li>MDR-GNBs: Several methods for detection of MDR-GNBs have been
          employed, including use of peri-rectal or rectal swabs alone or in
          combination with oro-pharyngeal, endotracheal, inguinal, or wound
          cultures. The absence of standardized screening media for many gram negative bacilli can make the process of isolating a specific MDR-GNB a
relatively labor-intensive process(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a190">190</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a241">241, 250</a>).</li>
        <li> Rapid detection methods: Using conventional culture methods for active
          surveillance can result in a delay of 2-3 days before results are available. If
          the infection control precautions (e.g., Contact Precautions) are withheld
          until the results are available, the desired infection control measures could
          be delayed. If empiric precautions are used pending negative surveillance
          culture results, precautions may be unnecessarily implemented for many, if
          not most, patients. For this reason, investigators have sought methods for
          decreasing the time necessary to obtain a result from ASC. Commercially
          available media containing chromogenic enzyme substrates (CHROMagar
          MRSA(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a263">263, 264</a>) has been shown to have high sensitivity and specificity
          for identification of MRSA and facilitate detection of MRSA colonies in
          screening cultures as early as 16 hours after inoculation. In addition, realtime
          PCR-based tests for rapid detection of MRSA directly from culture
          swabs (< 1-2 hours) are now commercially available(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a265">265-267</a>), as well as
          PCR-based tests for detection of vanA and van B genes from rectal
          swabs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a268">268</a>). The impact of rapid testing on the effectiveness of active
          surveillance as a prevention strategy, however, has not been fully
          determined. Rapid identification of MRSA in one study was associated with
          a significant reduction in MRSA infections acquired in the medical ICU, but
          not the surgical ICU(265). A mathematical model characterizing MRSA
          transmission dynamics predicted that, in comparison to conventional
          culture methods, the use of rapid detection tests may decrease isolation
          needs in settings of low-endemicity and result in more rapid reduction in
          prevalence in highly-endemic settings(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a249">249</a>).</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Some MDRO control reports described surveillance cultures of healthcare
personnel during outbreaks, but colonized or infected healthcare personnel are
rarely the source of ongoing transmission, and this strategy should be reserved
for settings in which specific healthcare personnel have been epidemiologically
implicated in the transmission of MDROs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a92">92</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a154">154</a>, 1<a href="mdro_reference.html#a88">88</a>).    </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <a name="a14" id="a14"></a>
  <li> <strong>Infection Control Precautions</strong>. Since 1996 CDC has recommended the use of
Standard and Contact Precautions for MDROs &quot;judged by an infection control
program... to be of special clinical and epidemiologic significance.&quot; This
recommendation was based on general consensus and was not necessarily
evidence-based. No studies have directly compared the efficacy of Standard
Precautions alone versus Standard Precautions and Contact Precautions, with or
without ASC, for control of MDROs. Some reports mention the use of one or both
sets of precautions as part of successful MDRO control efforts; however, the
precautions were not the primary focus of the study intervention(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a164">164</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a190">190</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a205">205</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a269">269</a>-
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a271">271</a>). The NIH-sponsored study mentioned earlier (Section: Overview of the MDRO
control literature) may provide some answers,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a> (<a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1" >http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT00100386?order=1</a>).  <br />

<br />


  <a name="a15" id="a15"></a>
<p><strong>Standard Precautions</strong> have an essential role in preventing MDRO transmission,
even in facilities that use Contact Precautions for patients with an identified MDRO.
Colonization with MDROs is frequently undetected; even surveillance cultures may
fail to identify colonized persons due to lack of sensitivity, laboratory deficiencies, or
intermittent colonization due to antimicrobial therapy(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a262">262</a>). Therefore, Standard
Precautions must be used in order to prevent transmission from potentially colonized
patients. Hand hygiene is an important component of Standard Precautions. The
authors of the Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a106">106</a>) cited nine
studies that demonstrated a temporal relationship between improved adherence to
recommended hand hygiene practices and control of MDROs. It is noteworthy that in
one report the frequency of hand hygiene did not improve with use of Contact
Precautions but did improve when gloves were used (per Standard Precautions) for
contact with MDRO patients(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a272">272</a>).</p>
<p>MDRO control efforts frequently involved changes in isolation practices, especially
during outbreaks. In the majority of reports, Contact Precautions were implemented
for all patients found to be colonized or infected with the target MDRO (See Table 2). Some facilities also preemptively used Contact Precautions, in conjunction with ASC,
for all new admissions or for all patients admitted to a specific unit, until a negative
screening culture for the target MDRO was reported(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a30">30</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a273">273</a>).</p>
<a name="a16" id="a16"></a>
<p>
  <strong>Contact Precautions</strong> are intended to prevent transmission of infectious agents,
including epidemiologically important microorganisms, which are transmitted by direct
or indirect contact with the patient or the patient's environment. A single-patient room
is preferred for patients who require Contact Precautions. When a single-patient
room is not available, consultation with infection control is necessary to assess the
various risks associated with other patient placement options (e.g., cohorting,
keeping the patient with an existing roommate). HCP caring for patients on Contact
Precautions should wear a gown and gloves for all interactions that may involve
contact with the patient or potentially contaminated areas in the patient's
environment. Donning gown and gloves upon room entry and discarding before
exiting the patient room is done to contain pathogens, especially those that have
been implicated in transmission through environmental contamination (e.g., VRE, C.
difficile, noroviruses and other intestinal tract agents; RSV)(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a109">109</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a111">111</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a274">274</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a277">277</a>).</p>
<p>
<a name="a17" id="a17"></a>
<em><strong>Cohorting and other MDRO control strategies. </strong></em>In several reports, cohorting of
patients(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a152">152</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a153">153</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a167">167</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a183">183</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, 1<a href="mdro_reference.html#a88">88</a>, 1<a href="mdro_reference.html#a89">89</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a217">217</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a242">242</a>), cohorting of staff (<a href="mdro_reference.html#a184">184</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a217">217</a>,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a242">242</a>, 2<a href="mdro_reference.html#a78">78</a>), use of designated beds or units(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a183">183, 184)</a>, and even unit closure(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a38">38</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a146">146</a>,
<a href="mdro_reference.html#a159">159</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a161">161</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a279">279</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a280">280</a>) were necessary to control transmission. Some authors indicated
that implementation of the latter two strategies were the turning points in their control
efforts; however, these measures usually followed many other actions to prevent
transmission. In one, two-center study, moving MRSA-positive patients into single
rooms or cohorting these patients in designated bays failed to reduce transmission in
ICUs. However, in this study adherence to recommendations for hand hygiene
between patient contacts was only 21%(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a281">281</a>). Other published studies, including one
commissioned by the American Institute of Architects and the Facility Guidelines
Institute (www.aia.org/aah_gd_hospcons), have documented a beneficial relationship
between private rooms and reduction in risk of acquiring MDROs(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a282">282</a>). Additional studies are needed to define the specific contribution of using single-patient rooms
and/or cohorting on preventing transmission of MDROs.</p>
<p>
<a name="a18" id="a18"></a>
<em><strong>Duration of Contact Precautions. </strong></em>The necessary duration of Contact Precautions
for patients treated for infection with an MDRO, but who may continue to be
colonized with the organism at one or more body sites, remains an unresolved issue.
Patients may remain colonized with MDROs for prolonged periods; shedding of these
organisms may be intermittent, and surveillance cultures may fail to detect their
presence(84, 250, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a283">283</a>). The 19<a href="mdro_reference.html#a95">95</a> HICPAC guideline for preventing the transmission
of VRE suggested three negative stool/perianal cultures obtained at weekly intervals
as a criterion for discontinuation of Contact Precautions(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a247">274</a>). One study found these
criteria generally reliable(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a284">284</a>). However, this and other studies have noted a
recurrence of VRE positive cultures in persons who subsequently receive
antimicrobial therapy and persistent or intermittent carriage of VRE for more than 1
year has been reported(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a284">284</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a285">286</a>). Similarly, colonization with MRSA can be
prolonged(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a287">287, 288</a>). Studies demonstrating initial clearance of MRSA following
decolonization therapy have reported a high frequency of subsequent carriage(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a289">289, 290</a>). There is a paucity of information in the literature on when to discontinue
Contact Precautions for patients colonized with a MDR-GNB, possibly because
infection and colonization with these MDROs are often associated with outbreaks.
Despite the uncertainty about when to discontinue Contact Precautions, the studies
offer some guidance. In the context of an outbreak, prudence would dictate that
Contact Precautions be used indefinitely for all previously infected and known
colonized patients. Likewise, if ASC are used to detect and isolate patients colonized
with MRSA or VRE, and there is no decolonization of these patients, it is logical to
assume that Contact Precautions would be used for the duration of stay in the setting
where they were first implemented. In general, it seems reasonable to discontinue
Contact Precautions when three or more surveillance cultures for the target MDRO
are repeatedly negative over the course of a week or two in a patient who has not
received antimicrobial therapy for several weeks, especially in the absence of a draining wound, profuse respiratory secretions, or evidence implicating the specific
patient in ongoing transmission of the MDRO within the facility.</p>

<em><strong>Barriers used for contact with patients infected or colonized with MDROs.</strong></em><br />

Three studies evaluated the use of gloves with or without gowns for all patient
contacts to prevent VRE acquisition in ICU settings(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a30">30</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a105">105</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a273">273</a>). Two of the studies
showed that use of both gloves and gowns reduced VRE transmission(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a30">30</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a105">105</a>) while
the third showed no difference in transmission based on the barriers used(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a273">273</a>). One
study in a LTCF compared the use of gloves only, with gloves plus contact isolation,
for patients with four MDROs, including VRE and MRSA, and found no
difference(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a86">86</a>). However, patients on contact isolation were more likely to acquire
MDR-K. pneumoniae strains that were prevalent in the facility; reasons for this were
not specifically known. In addition to differences in outcome, differing methodologies
make comparisons difficult. Specifically, HCP adherence to the recommended
protocol, the influence of added precautions on the number of HCP-patient
interactions, and colonization pressure were not consistently assessed.</p>
<p>
<a name="a20" id="a20"></a>
<em><strong>Impact of Contact Precautions on patient care and well-being.</strong></em> There are limited
data regarding the impact of Contact Precautions on patients. Two studies found that
HCP, including attending physicians, were half as likely to enter the rooms of(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a291">291</a>), or
examine(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a292">292</a>), patients on Contact Precautions. Other investigators have reported
similar observations on surgical wards(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a293">293</a>). Two studies reported that patients in
private rooms and on barrier precautions for an MDRO had increased anxiety and
depression scores(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a294">294, 295</a>). Another study found that patients placed on Contact
Precautions for MRSA had significantly more preventable adverse events, expressed
greater dissatisfaction with their treatment, and had less documented care than
control patients who were not in isolation(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a296">296</a>). Therefore, when patients are placed
on Contact Precautions, efforts must be made by the healthcare team to counteract
these potential adverse effects.</p>
  </li>
  <a name="a21" id="a21"></a>
  <li><strong>Environmental measures.</strong> The potential role of environmental reservoirs, such as
surfaces and medical equipment, in the transmission of VRE and other MDROs has
been the subject of several reports(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a109">109</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a111">111</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a297">297, 298</a>). While environmental cultures
are not routinely recommended(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a299">299</a>), environmental cultures were used in several
studies to document contamination, and led to interventions that included the use of
dedicated noncritical medical equipment(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a217">217</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a300">300</a>), assignment of dedicated cleaning
personnel to the affected patient care unit(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a154">154</a>), and increased cleaning and
disinfection of frequently-touched surfaces (e.g., bedrails, charts, bedside
commodes, doorknobs). A common reason given for finding environmental
contamination with an MDRO was the lack of adherence to facility procedures for
cleaning and disinfection. In an educational and observational intervention, which
targeted a defined group of housekeeping personnel, there was a persistent
decrease in the acquisition of VRE in a medical ICU(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a301">301</a>). Therefore, monitoring for
adherence to recommended environmental cleaning practices is an important
determinant for success in controlling transmission of MDROs and other pathogens
in the environment(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a274">274</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a302">302</a>).</p>
<p>
In the MDRO reports reviewed, enhanced environmental cleaning was frequently
undertaken when there was evidence of environmental contamination and ongoing
transmission. Rarely, control of the target MDRO required vacating a patient care unit
for complete environmental cleaning and assessment (<a href="mdro_reference.html#a175">175</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a279">279</a>).  </li>
<a name="a22" id="a22"></a>
  <li> <strong>Decolonization.</strong> Decolonization entails treatment of persons colonized with a
    specific MDRO, usually MRSA, to eradicate carriage of that organism. Although
    some investigators have attempted to decolonize patients harboring VRE(220), few
    have achieved success. However, decolonization of persons carrying MRSA in their
    nares has proved possible with several regimens that include topical mupirocin alone
    or in combination with orally administered antibiotics (e.g., rifampin in combination
    with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin) plus the use of an antimicrobial
    soap for bathing(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a303">303</a>). In one report, a 3-day regimen of baths with povidone-iodine
    and nasal therapy with mupirocin resulted in eradication of nasal MRSA colonization(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a304">304</a>). These and other methods of MRSA decolonization have been
thoroughly reviewed.(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a303">303</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a305">305</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a306">307</a>).<p>

Decolonization regimens are not sufficiently effective to warrant routine use.
Therefore, most healthcare facilities have limited the use of decolonization to MRSA
outbreaks, or other high prevalence situations, especially those affecting special-care
units. Several factors limit the utility of this control measure on a widespread basis: 1)
identification of candidates for decolonization requires surveillance cultures; 2)
candidates receiving decolonization treatment must receive follow-up cultures to
ensure eradication; and 3) recolonization with the same strain, initial colonization with
a mupirocin-resistant strain, and emergence of resistance to mupirocin during
treatment can occur(<a href="mdro_reference.html#a289">289</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a303">303</a>, <a href="mdro_reference.html#a308">308</a>-<a href="mdro_reference.html#a310">310</a>). HCP implicated in transmission of MRSA
are candidates for decolonization and should be treated and culture negative before
returning to direct patient care. In contrast, HCP who are colonized with MRSA, but
are asymptomatic, and have not been linked epidemiologically to transmission, do
not require decolonization.</p>
