Her research for the National Bioethics Center which explores how “the critical nature of the public health communications network” that was instituted during National Negro Health Week by Booker T. Washington and his colleagues in 1915, created an academic opportunity for her to work with Dr. Rueben Warren, Professor and Director of the National Bioethics Center to establish an annual Public Health Ethics Symposium at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during Minority Health Month. The first forum in 2015 focused on the health disparities of African Americans and was titled, “National Negro Health Week to National Minority Health Month: 100 Years of Moving Public Health Forward.”&#160; The forum in April 2016 will concentrate on the Hispanic/Latino population, the theme is “Making it Count: Advancing a Public Health Ethics Framework on Data Collection for Social Justice.”&#160; In 2017 the Public Health Ethics Symposium will deliberate the health challenges in the Native American population and the 2018 Public Health Ethics Symposium will concentrate on disparities experienced by Asian Americans. Each year this forum is offered for in-house participation at the CDC and virtual participation via the internet. Joan’s scholarship investigation at the National Bioethics Center also includes the National Negro Health Movement and the intersection of media, social media, bioethics, racism, race-based medicine, religion and the phenomenology of public health injustices negatively impacting women, communities of color and impoverished populations.</p>				</div>
