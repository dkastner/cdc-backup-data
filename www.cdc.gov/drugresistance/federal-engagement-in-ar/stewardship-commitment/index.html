<p>Antibiotic stewardship is the development, promotion, and implementation of activities to ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics. By &#160;adopting antibiotic stewardship principles, organizations can improve how antibiotics are used and prescribed, and can slow the rise of antibiotic resistant infections.</p>
