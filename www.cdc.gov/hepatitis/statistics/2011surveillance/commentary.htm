<h2><a id="summary" name="summary"><!-- --></a>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>As part of CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), viral hepatitis case-reports are received electronically from state health departments via CDC’s National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS), a computerized public health surveillance system that provides CDC with data regarding cases of nationally notifiable diseases on a weekly basis. Although surveillance infrastructure is in place for reporting of acute infection, reports of chronic hepatitis B and C, which account for the greatest burden of disease, are not submitted by all states. As noted in a recent report from the Institute of Medicine (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>1</cite></a>), surveillance capacity to monitor both acute and chronic viral hepatitis is limited at the state and local levels, resulting in underreporting and incomplete variable quality data that is insufficient for understanding the magnitude of viral hepatitis.</p>

<p>Data in this report should be interpreted with the consideration that reported cases of acute or chronic viral hepatitis represent only those relatively few infected persons who were detected, diagnosed, met a stringent case definition, and eventually reported to CDC in 2011. Because most acute and chronic infections are not reported, this Summary is mainly useful in detecting major trends in viral hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV). In 2011 and 2012 a major effort was undertaken to improve methodologies for estimating total number of new cases of hepatitis A, B and C from the number of cases reported for each disease (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>2</cite></a>). Estimates in this report of incidence of new infections were obtained using the newly improved methodology (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>2</cite></a>). These estimates cannot be compared to previous years’ estimates that were obtained using different (unpublished) procedures; however, trends seen in reported data still pertain, such as the increase in acute HCV in young persons evident in 2011.</p>

<p>Because chronic HBV and HCV infection are largely hidden and part of what the current US Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Howard Koh has dubbed the “Secret Epidemic” (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>3</cite></a>), this report also provides data to inform our understanding of the current epidemic of chronic hepatitis B and C.</p>

<p>With progressive infant vaccination recommendations since 1996—with universal infant vaccination since 2006--vaccination rates and evidence of vaccine-induced immunity in young patients have been increasing continuously in the past decade (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>4</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>5</cite></a>). Half of all hepatitis A infections now apparently are acquired overseas by adult travelers (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>6</cite></a>). The major public health demands regarding hepatitis A relate to newly discovered HAV-infected foodhandlers, as these place a large burden on local public health departments to notify, test, and vaccinate potentially infected restaurant patrons (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>7</cite></a>). There were 1,398 reported cases of acute HAV in 2011. After asymptomatic infections and under-reporting were taken into account, it was estimated that approximately 2,700 (1,650-4,370) new infections occurred in 2011.</p>

<p>Acute hepatitis B has been declining in incidence since 1990 mainly due to effective vaccination strategies, but chronic HBV, estimated at 700,000-1.4 million of the US population (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>8</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>9</cite></a>), remains a major public health challenge. As the surveillance data in this report and other data indicate, about half of all chronic HBV infections are among persons born in Asia and Asian-Americans who were born to HBV-infected mothers in the United States. Identifying these chronically infected persons and linking them to care remains a challenge (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>10</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>11</cite></a>). There were 2,890 cases of acute HBV reported in 2011. After adjusting for asymptomatic infections and under-reporting, the estimated number of new HBV infections was approximately 18,800 (7,400- 86,200).</p>

<p>After 6 years of receiving reports of about 800 cases of acute HCV each year, there was a marked increase of 45% in reported acute HCV infections (n=1,229) in 2011 compared with 2010. This increase is thought to reflect a trend of increasing HCV infections among adolescents and young adults particularly in eastern and mid-western states. Based on limited epidemiologic studies, cases of reported HCV infection among young persons are white, live in non-urban areas, have a history of injection drug use, and previous use of opioid agonists such as oxycodone (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>12</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>13</cite></a>). Some of the increase in reported acute HCV reflects increased ascertainment by states and local health departments funded by CDC to investigate such cases more actively—New York, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Florida, and Philadelphia. However, in some locations where the number of cases has increased, notably in states that include rural Appalachian counties, those increases have occurred without any increased funding, or investigatory or ascertainment activities (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>14</cite></a>). There were 1,229 acute HCV cases reported in 2011. After adjusting for asymptomatic infections and under-reporting, an estimated 16,600 (7,200- 43,400) new infections with HCV occurred in 2011.</p>

<p>Chronic HCV infection affects at least 3 million US residents (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>15</cite></a>). However, prevalent chronic infections appear to be declining due, at least in part, to increasing mortality in HCV-infected persons—usually persons aged 45 to 65 years old—that since 2007 has yearly exceeded deaths from HIV/AIDS in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>16</cite></a>). A major public health challenge is to increase the proportion of people tested (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>17</cite></a>) and to increase the proportion of those who test positive who are referred for care and treatment (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>10</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>11</cite></a>).</p>

<h2><a id="bkgrndI" name="bkgrndI"><!-- --></a>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Viral hepatitis is caused by infection with any of at least five distinct viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Most symptomatic viral hepatitis infections in the United States are attributable to HAV, HBV, and HCV. All three of these unrelated viruses can produce an acute illness characterized by nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and jaundice, although many of these acute infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild disease. Thus, many persons infected with HBV or HCV are unaware they are infected and have clinically silent infections for decades until developing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndA" name="bkgrndA"><!-- --></a>Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>Transmitted through the fecal-oral route, HAV is acquired primarily through close personal contact and foodborne outbreaks (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>18</cite></a>). Since 1995, effective vaccines to prevent hepatitis A virus infection have been available in the United States, increasing the feasibility of eliminating indigenous transmission. In 1996, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended administration of hepatitis A vaccine to persons at increased risk for the disease, including international travelers, men who have sex with men (MSM), non-injection and injection-drug users (IDUs), and children living in communities with high rates of disease (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>19</cite></a>). In 1996 ACIP also recommended routine vaccination for children living in 11 states with average hepatitis A rates of <u>&#62;</u>20 cases per 100,000 population and recommended that vaccination be considered for children in an additional six states with rates of 10–20 cases per 100,000 population (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>20</cite></a>). ACIP expanded these recommendations in 2006 to include routine vaccination of newborns in all 50 states (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>4</cite></a>).</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndB" name="bkgrndB"><!-- --></a>Hepatitis B</h3>

<p>HBV is transmitted by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to the blood or body fluids of an infected person, most often through injection-drug use, from sexual contact with an infected person, or from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth. Transmission of HBV also can occur among persons who have prolonged but nonsexual interpersonal contact with someone who is HBV-infected (e.g., household contacts).</p>

<p>HBV is transmitted by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to the blood or body fluids of an infected person, from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth, through close contact within households, through exposures to unscreened blood transfusion or unsafe injections in health care settings, through injection-drug use, and from sexual contact with an infected person. Adults with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of acquiring HBV infection. These persons are recommended to receive hepatitis B vaccination before the age of 60 and, if above that age, to be considered for vaccination (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>21</cite></a>).</p>

<p>The risk for chronic HBV infection decreases with increasing age at infection. Of infants who acquire HBV infection from their mothers at birth, as many as 90% become chronically infected, whereas 30%–50% of children infected at age 1–5 years become chronically infected. This percentage is smaller among adults, in whom approximately 5% of all acute HBV infections progress to chronic infection (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>22</cite></a>).</p>

<p>Effective vaccines to prevent hepatitis B virus infection have been available in the United States since 1981. Ten years later, a comprehensive strategy was recommended for the elimination of HBV transmission in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>23</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>24</cite></a>). This strategy encompassed the following four components:</p>

<ul>
<li>universal vaccination of infants beginning at birth;</li>

<li>prevention of perinatal HBV infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBV infection and the provision of immunoprophylaxis to infants born either to infected women or to women of unknown infection status;</li>

<li>routine vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents; and</li>

<li>vaccination of adults at increased risk for infection (including health-care workers, dialysis patients, household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection, recipients of certain blood products, persons with a recent history of having multiple sex partners concurrently, those infected with a sexually transmitted disease, MSM, and IDUs).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to hepatitis B vaccination, efforts have been made to improve care and treatment for persons who are living with hepatitis B. In the United States, 700,000-1.4 million persons are estimated to be infected with the virus (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>8</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>25</cite></a>), many of whom are unaware of their infection status (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>10</cite></a>). To improve health outcomes for these persons, in 2008 CDC issued recommendations to guide hepatitis B testing and public health management of persons with chronic hepatitis B infection (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>26</cite></a>). These guidelines stress the need for testing persons at high risk for infection, conducting contact management, educating patients, and administering FDA-approved therapies for treating hepatitis B.</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndC" name="bkgrndC"><!-- --></a>Hepatitis C</h3>

<p>HCV is transmitted primarily through percutaneous (parenteral) exposure that can result from injection-drug use, needle-stick injuries, and inadequate infection control in health-care settings. Much less often, HCV transmission occurs among HIV-positive persons, especially MSM, as a result of sexual contact with an HCV-infected partner (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>27</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>28</cite></a>), among persons who received non-professionally applied tattoos (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>28</cite></a>) and among infants born to HCV-infected mothers (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>29</cite></a>). With an estimated 3.2 million chronically infected persons nationwide, HCV infection is the most common blood-borne infection in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>15</cite></a>).</p>

<p>Currently a single positive anti-HCV result cannot distinguish between acute and chronic (past or present) HCV infection, and making this distinction requires a health department to follow-up with a provider to determine if there were symptoms. Laboratory criteria in the 2011 case definition for past or present HCV infection require one or more of the following: anti-HCV positive (repeatedly reactive) by EIA, verified by at least one more specific assay, or HCV RIBA positive, or HCV nucleic acid test (NAT) positive, or anti-HCV screening-test positive with an assay-specific signal-to-cutoff ratio predictive of a true. No clinical symptoms are required; however, the case must be known to not be an acute case. Approximately 75%-85% of newly infected persons develop chronic infection (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>30</cite></a>).</p>

<p>Because of the high burden of chronic HCV infection in the United States and because no vaccine is available for preventing infection, national recommendations (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>31</cite></a>) emphasize other primary prevention activities, including screening and testing blood donors, inactivating HCV in plasma-derived products, testing persons at risk for HCV infection and providing them with risk-reduction counseling, and consistently implementing and practicing infection control in health-care settings. In 2010, the FDA approved point-of-care tests for HCV infection, which meant that patients could receive HCV test results within the same visit and faster referral to care (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>32</cite></a>). In 2012, CDC augmented existing risk-based recommendations for HCV testing by recommending one-time screening for HCV infection among all those born during 1945-1965 (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>33</cite></a>). It is estimated that persons born during these years have a 3% prevalence of HCV antibodies, which is five times higher than the prevalence seen in adults born in other years. Of all persons living with HCV infection, about 75% were born during 1945-1965; a similar percentage of HCV-associated deaths can be attributed to this birth cohort (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>33</cite></a>). The goal of the new birth-cohort approach to HCV testing is to identify unrecognized infections among the segment of the population with the largest risk of HCV associated morbidity and mortality, thereby increasing opportunities for persons infected with HCV to benefit from appropriate care and treatment. Implementation of the birth cohort screening recommendation and point of care testing for HCV infection will facilitate testing, notification of results, post-test counseling and referral to care.</p>

Linkage to care and treatment is critical to improving health outcomes for persons found to be infected with HCV. Such linkage is particularly important in light of the major advancements that have been made in HCV treatments. For patients infected with HCV, treatment has previously consisted of pegylated interferon combined with oral doses of ribavirin, a regimen that has improved health outcomes for many infected persons. Approximately 40% of HCV-infected patients receiving this therapy clear their infection. New direct acting agents against HCV (telaprevir, boceprevir) were licensed by the FDA in 2011 and are now standard-of-care. These agents, when given in combination with current therapy, can increase virologic cure rates to 80% while decreasing duration of therapy ( <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>34</cite></a>). Several drugs are now administered orally (a major advancement in how treatments are administered for this infection), leading to viral suppression in 90% of patients taking one of these new oral medications ( <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>35</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>36</cite></a>).

<h3><a id="caseClassification" name="caseClassification"><!-- --></a>Notes on “Case Classification”</h3>

<p>For analysis at the national level, cases of viral hepatitis are considered “confirmed” if they meet both the clinical case definition and laboratory criteria for diagnosis; however, these criteria are evaluated at the state or local level and are not validated by CDC. For hepatitis A, cases also are considered confirmed if they meet the clinical case definition and involve a person who is epidemiologically linked to someone with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A (e.g., through household or sexual contact with an infected person or eating HAV-contaminated food or food prepared by an infected foodhandler during the 15–50 days before symptom onset).</p>

<h3><a id="infoSources" name="infoSources"><!-- --></a>Sources of Information</h3>

<p>CDC relies on several sources of information to determine the incidence, prevalence, trends, and burden of viral hepatitis A, B, and C disease. The basis for most case reports is passive surveillance through the <em>National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS)</em><strong>.</strong> State and local health departments report acute hepatitis A, B and C infections (incident cases) through this system. However, a number of states do not report cases of chronic viral hepatitis B and C through the NNDSS. Collecting, verifying and reporting the many chronic cases of hepatitis B and C in the United States (estimated at over 4 million) is beyond the capability of many health departments. Reports of chronic hepatitis B and C are included in this Surveillance Summary from <em>NNDSS</em> and the <em>Emerging Infections Program (EIP).</em> This report includes the number or count of confirmed chronic cases reported to CDC through <em>NNDSS</em> from 10 states that gave permission for CDC to publish those counts. Data on confirmed cases of chronic hepatitis B and C from 9 selected sites that CDC funded in 2011, under the <em>EIP</em> to conduct more active case ascertainment and investigations are also included. Severity and burden of viral hepatitis A, B and C disease are measured by information obtained from death certificates through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>37</cite></a>).</p>

<p>Surveillance activities also include the examination of other data sets which are not included in this report, such as the <em>National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)</em> and the <em>National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)</em>. Additional special studies, including analysis of the <em>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),</em> which collects data from a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 non-institutionalized US residents each year, also are important in understanding the prevalence of chronic HCV (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>14</cite></a>; MM Denniston, manuscript submitted).</p>

<h3><a id="techNat" name="techNat"><!-- --></a>National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS)</h3>

<h4><em>Background</em></h4>

<p>Each week, state and territorial health departments report cases of acute, symptomatic viral hepatitis to CDC’s NNDSS. Since 1990, states have been electronically submitting individual case reports (absent of personal identifiers) to CDC. States’ participation in reporting nationally notifiable diseases, including viral hepatitis, is voluntary.</p>

National surveillance for viral hepatitis (including acute hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C; chronic hepatitis B; and chronic [past or present] hepatitis C) is based on case definitions developed and approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC. In 2011, reported cases of acute and chronic viral hepatitis were required to meet the following CSTE-defined clinical and laboratory criteria (available at: <a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&amp;Yr=2011">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&#38;Yr=2011</a>).

<h3><a id="techEnh" name="techEnh"><!-- --></a>Enhanced Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Sites</h3>

<h4><em>Background</em></h4>

<p>In 2011 CDC funded select sites for viral hepatitis surveillance through the Emerging Infections Program (EIP), a network involving CDC, state health departments, academic institutions, and local health departments. Since 2004, participating EIP sites have conducted routine surveillance for chronic HBV and chronic (past or present) HCV infections. All chronic cases of viral hepatitis obtained through these sites are de-duplicated; additionally, for a percentage of cases, follow-up is conducted by health departments to obtain clinical and laboratory data and information regarding risk behaviors and exposures. Each month, a dataset of cumulative cases from each site was sent to CDC’s DVH via a secure electronic file transfer protocol.</p>

<h4><em>Data Collection</em></h4>

<p>CDC funded five states (Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, New Mexico, and Oregon), two cities (New York City and San Francisco), and 34 counties in New York State to conduct enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance, representing a combined population of approximately 40 million persons. In each of these jurisdictions, clinical laboratories are mandated to submit reports from persons with positive HBV and HCV test results to state or local health departments. Participating health departments routinely review each report to assess whether the current case definition was met as established by CSTE and CDC. To determine whether a case is new, each site matches new case reports to existing cases in the surveillance registry using personal identifying information. New cases are added to an electronic registry, whereas duplicate cases are used to update previous reports. Most health departments collect basic demographic data (e.g., age and sex) from the laboratory reports. Efforts vary by site regarding the level of investigation undertaken to collect and store supplemental information (e.g., risk factor data) from patients or their providers. <u><!-- --></u></p>

<h4><em>Analyses</em></h4>

<p>Analyses were conducted on all serologically confirmed cases of chronic hepatitis B and chronic (past or present) hepatitis C infection reported by EIP sites during 2011 and submitted to CDC by January 24, 2013. Rates were calculated using appropriate jurisdiction-specific (state, county, or city) 2011 population estimates obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<h4><em>Limitations</em></h4>

<p>The number of chronic cases included in this report is likely an underestimate of the true prevalence of disease because chronic cases are generally asymptomatic and less likely to be discovered and reported. Additionally, data from these sites may not be representative of the U.S. population, and because not all sites conduct comprehensive follow-up. Data regarding race/ethnicity, place of birth, and risk are missing for some case reports.</p>

<h4><!-- --></h4>

<h3><a id="techMort" name="techMort"><!-- --></a>Mortality/Death Certificates</h3>

<h4><em>Background</em></h4>

<p>Death certificates are completed for all deaths registered in the United States. Information from death certificates is provided by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, and certificates are filed in vital statistics offices within each state and the District of Columbia. Through a program called the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>36</cite></a>), information from death certificates is compiled by CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to produce national multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) data (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>38</cite></a>); causes of death are coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>39</cite></a>). MCOD data are used to determine the national burden of mortality associated with viral hepatitis infections and to describe the demographic characteristics of decedents.</p>

<p>A major study of these records from 1999 through 2007 showed that the annual number of deaths among HCV-infected persons now exceed the annual number of deaths among HIV-infected persons since 2007 (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>16</cite></a>).</p>

<h4><em>Methods</em></h4>

<p>We analyzed national multiple-cause mortality data collected during 2006–2010 (the most recent data-years available) obtained from NCHS. The following case definitions were used to identify a death associated with hepatitis A, B, and C.</p>

<p>Any death record with a report of</p>

<ul>
<li>hepatitis A (ICD-10: B15),</li>

<li>hepatitis B (ICD-10: B16, B17.0, B18.0, and B18.1), or</li>

<li>hepatitis C (ICD-10: B17.1 and B18.2) listed as the underlying or one of the multiple (e.g., contributing) causes of death in the record axis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Demographic information on age, race, and sex were examined. Deaths were divided into six age categories: 0–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and <u>&#62;</u>75 years. Race categories for 2006-2009 consisted of white (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), and non-black, non-white (which included all other racial and ethnic groups). For 2010, race/ethnicity categories consisted of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) to be consistent with those used by DVH.</p>

To calculate national mortality rates, the number of deaths was divided by the total U.S. Census population for each demographic subgroup. Rates on race, sex, and overall total were standardized to the age distribution of the standard U.S. population in 2000 ( <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>40</cite></a>). Data were analyzed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC).

<h4><em>Interpretation of Mortality Data</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>Differences in recording practices of death certificate information may cause misclassification of ICD-10 codes and demographic information.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Certain racial/ethnic populations likely are underrepresented in U.S. Census data (the denominator for calculating rates), potentially causing overestimated rates for these populations.</li>

<li>Analyses do not adjust for deaths resulting from undiagnosed viral hepatitis infections.</li>

<li>Death records listing more than one type of viral hepatitis infection were counted once for each type of infection. For example, a death with ICD-10 codes for both hepatitis B and C virus infections is counted once as a hepatitis B death and once as a hepatitis C death.</li>

<li>The race category designated as “non-white/non-black” includes all other race groups (e.g., APIs, AI/ANs, and persons who are Hispanic). This lack of specificity limits race-specific interpretation of mortality data prior to 2010.</li>

<h3><a id="invest" name="invest"><!-- --></a>Investigations of Acute Cases</h3>

<p>For 2011, national surveillance data indicate an increasing number of reported HCV in persons younger than 25 years-old in several states (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>1</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>2</cite></a>). Based on this, recent investigations of viral hepatitis outbreaks in the United States demonstrate the increased risk of hepatitis C in mainly young, white, non-urban heroin injection drug users (IDUs) who started with oral prescription opioid analogues (oxycodone, hydrocodone) (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>1</cite></a>, <a href="commentary.htm"><cite>2</cite></a>).</p>

<p>Instances of HBV and HCV transmission in the health care setting continue to occur (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>3</cite></a> <a href="commentary.htm"> </a>-13). Distinguishing cases of health-care-acquired viral hepatitis from those transmitted outside the health-care setting often depends on the quality of case reporting and therefore varies by state and locality. Cases must be detected by a health department with the capacity to detect and investigate suspected links to a single health care or long-term care facility (<a href="commentary.htm"><cite>11</cite></a> <a href="commentary.htm"> </a>). Investigation of suspected cases of health-care-associated viral hepatitis is multi-faceted, involving surveillance, epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory components. State and local health departments generally consult CDC’s DVH and the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) to seek technical assistance and support regarding the proper approach to investigating a possible healthcare-associated transmission event. These outbreaks and clusters of infections for 2011 are listed in Table 1. Outbreaks reported through 2012, including 4 in 2011, are now available at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/healthcarehepoutbreaktable.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Outbreaks/HealthcareHepOutbreakTable.htm</a>.</p>

<p>Data regarding viral hepatitis outbreaks obtained through current surveillance mechanisms are subject to limitations. Because not all outbreaks are identified or investigated at the state and local level or reported to CDC, the number of reported outbreaks for all years, including 2011, is an underestimate of the actual number of viral hepatitis outbreaks that occurred in health-care or in other congregant living facilities. In addition to the outbreak investigations conducted by whom as shown in Table 1, CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis staff offered technical and laboratory assistance to health departments in over 40 consultations in 2011.</p>

<h4><a id="investConsult" name="investConsult"><!-- --></a>Investigations/Consultations</h4>

<p>In 2011, CDC participated in 4 state-based investigations of outbreaks of viral hepatitis infection (two involving HBV and two involving HCV infection) (<a href="commentary.htm#investTable1"><cite>Table 1</cite></a>). Both outbreaks of HBV infection occurred in assisted-living facilities. Investigations at these locations revealed that 117 persons were potentially exposed to viral hepatitis. Upon testing, 9 of these persons were found to be infected with HBV. At one facility, an additional 4 new chronic infections were detected; of these 3 had viral molecular sequencing performed, and all matched, i.e. indicating they were a cluster of outbreak-related cases. Suspected modes of transmission included unsafe practices related to assisted blood glucose monitoring and breaches in infection control related to podiatric services.<br />
The outbreaks of HCV infection occurred in an outpatient hemodialysis facility and an outpatient pain management clinic. A total of 555 persons were identified as being potentially exposed and were tested for HCV infection; 8 of these persons were found to be infected with HCV. Suspected modes of transmission involved breaches in infection control including suspected syringe reuse that contaminated medication vials.</p>

<h3><a id="adjustments" name="adjustments"><!-- --></a>Adjustments to Reported Cases</h3>

<p>The Surveillance Team has been reanalyzing the estimators (multipliers) traditionally used to convert reported cases to estimated (true) incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, and C in the United States. Briefly, this review and analysis has been of more recent data that allow better estimation of the numbers and percentages of acute viral hepatitis cases who have symptoms, seek medical care, and get reported to local, state and federal health authorities (1). A probabilistic model factored probabilities of symptoms (I), referral to care and treatment (II), and rates of reporting to local and state department (III). This analysis indicated that reported cases represent an estimated one of 2.0 acute hepatitis A (random-effects model, 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 1.6-2.2); one of 6.5 hepatitis B (95% CI, 4.5-9.5); and one of 13.4 hepatitis C (95% CI 6.8- 25.0) cases (1). Accordingly, these estimators are used in this Surveillance Summary. These estimates cannot be used to deduce trends by comparison with estimations obtained in previous years, as these latter were obtained from different (and unpublished) calculations; trends are best seen in reported cases, as in the increase in acute HCV in 2011 among nationally reported cases.</p>

<p>Historically, acute hepatitis A rates vary cyclically, with nationwide increases every 10-15 years. The last peak was in 1995; since that time, rates of hepatitis A have steadily declined. In 2011, a total of 1,398 cases of acute hepatitis A were reported nationwide to CDC (Table 2.1). The overall incidence rate for 2011 was 0.4 cases per 100,000 population. No data were available for 2011 from the District of Columbia.</p>

<h3>Hepatitis C, Past or Present</h3>

<p><strong>Hepatitis C, Past or Present</strong></p>

The current case definition for hepatitis C cases other than acute cases requires as little as a single postivie anti-HCV test and that the case be known not to be acute to meet the case definition.

<h2><a id="disc" name="disc"><!-- --></a>Discussion</h2>

<p>National surveillance data for acute viral hepatitis provide essential information for: identifying outbreaks and trends in viral hepatitis; targeting groups who need enhanced public health efforts; providing data for national and local estimates of the health burden of hepatitis A, B, and C; and evaluation of intervention efforts. National rates for acute hepatitis A and B have been published since 1966, and national rates for acute hepatitis C/non-A, non-B have been published since 1992. Major changes in the epidemiology of these diseases have occurred over these time periods, largely resulting from implementation of prevention strategies for each disease, including the introduction of effective vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</p>

<p>NNDSS, the core of viral hepatitis surveillance, was designed to enable states to notify CDC of infectious diseases diagnosed with a single positive laboratory test. Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis B and C do not fit this pattern, as additional information beyond a single laboratory test is required to confirm a case (1). To better count and characterize cases of viral hepatitis and estimate the burden of disease, CDC’s DVH supplements NNDSS data with those obtained from funded EIP sites, national surveys, and vital statistics.</p>

<p>Data from NNDSS indicate declining rates of acute hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, and acute hepatitis C during 1995–2010. More recent data show the rate of decline has decreased, and incidence has become relatively stable for acute hepatitis A and B, whereas there was an increase for acute hepatitis C in 2011. However, most new infections with HAV, HBV, and HCV remain undetected and unreported. In 2011, after adjusting for asymptomatic cases and underreporting, the estimated incidence of HAV, HBV, and HCV infections was approximately: 2,500; 20,000; and 16,500 cases, respectively. As noted in “Adjustments to Reported Cases” (page 16), these estimates all have wide confidence intervals, and cannot be compared directly with estimates from previous years which were obtained using different calculations.</p>

<p>Despite decreases in acute viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis infection continues to affect millions of Americans. In the United States, an estimated 700,000–1.4 million persons are living with chronic hepatitis B infection (2, 3), and an estimated 2.7–3.9 million persons are chronically infected with hepatitis C (4).<br />
In 2011, almost 40,000 reports of chronic hepatitis B and nearly 186,000 reports of chronic hepatitis C were submitted to CDC through NNDSS. Of these, 11,781 reports of chronic hepatitis B infection and 58,286 reports of chronic hepatitis C infections were available for descriptive analyses.<br />
Mortality data from 2006-2010, the latest year for which these data were available, reveal the serious health consequences associated with viral hepatitis: chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, was the 12th leading cause of death in the United States in 2010 (5). Viral-hepatitis-associated death rates in 2010 were highest among persons infected with HCV (4.65 deaths per 100,000 population), followed by HBV (0.52 deaths per 100,000 population), and HAV (0.03 deaths per 100,000 population).</p>

<p>CDC and state health departments rely on surveillance data to track the incidence of acute infection, guide development and evaluation of programs and policies designed to prevent infection and minimize the public health impact of viral hepatitis, and monitor progress towards achieving goals established for these programs and policies. Effective systems for conducting surveillance for chronic HBV and HCV infections are needed to ensure accurate reporting of all cases and to support and evaluate prevention activities. Additional investments in surveillance at the local, state, and national levels are essential to building strong prevention programs that interrupt transmission of viral hepatitis and improve the health of those who are already infected.</p>
