<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="summary" name="summary" title="Summary"> </a>SUMMARY</h2>

<p><em><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Please note: </strong></font>An erratum has been published for this document. To view the erratum, please click </em><a href="erratumto2013summary_aug2016.htm"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>As part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS), viral hepatitis case-reports are received electronically from state and territorial health departments via CDC’s National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS), a computerized public health surveillance system that provides CDC with data on cases of nationally notifiable diseases on a weekly basis. Although the surveillance infrastructure is in place for reporting of both acute and chronic infections, case-reports of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and past or present hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, which account for the greatest burden of disease, were submitted by 41 states and 37 states, respectively, in 2013. As noted in a report from the Institute of Medicine (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef01">1</a>), surveillance capacity to monitor viral hepatitis is limited at the state and local level, resulting in under-reporting and variable data quality.</p>

<p>The NNDSS data in this report should be interpreted with the understanding that reported cases of viral hepatitis represent only those infected persons who were detected, diagnosed, met a stringent case definition, and eventually reported to CDC in 2013. Because many infections are not reported, this Summary is most useful in detecting trends over time in newly reported cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV), HBV, and HCV infections. In an effort to account for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, a method was developed in 2011 to better quantify the number of new cases of hepatitis A, B, and C from the actual number cases reported for each disease (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02">2</a>). The estimates in this report were obtained using this new methodology. We caution the reader, however, that the estimates of the number of new cases after 2011, including those in this report, cannot be compared to estimates before 2011, which were obtained using a different (unpublished) methodology, but the trends seen in reported data still pertain, such as the increase in the number of acute cases of HCV infection among young persons that was observed beginning in 2011.</p>

<p>Because chronic HBV and current HCV infections are largely hidden and part of what the former United States Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Howard Koh has dubbed the “Silent Epidemic” (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef03">3</a>), this report also provides data to inform our understanding of the current epidemic of chronic hepatitis B and C.</p>

<p>With progressive infant hepatitis A vaccination recommendations since 1996 and universal infant vaccination since 2006, vaccination rates and evidence of vaccine-induced immunity in young patients have been increasing in the past decade (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef04">4</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef05">5</a>). Despite protection among young persons, adults who do not fall into a high-risk group are not vaccinated and are therefore susceptible to infection. Since 2011, an increase in the number of reported cases of hepatitis A has been observed. &#160;In 2013, there were 1,781 reported cases of hepatitis A, which represented a 14% increase from 2012. This increase reflects cases ascertained during a large hepatitis A outbreak from imported pomegranate arils consumed by persons in several southwestern states and Hawaii (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef06">6</a>). After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02">2</a>), the estimated number of new HAV infections was 3,473.</p>

<p>Acute hepatitis B has been declining in incidence since 1990 mainly due to effective vaccination strategies, but for the first time since 1990, in 2013, the number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B increased to 3,050 cases, which represented a 5.4% increase from 2012. Although this increase may reflect the growing number of drug-related and healthcare-related outbreaks associated with hepatitis B transmission, it may be premature to interpret the increase from 2012-2013; continued monitoring over more years of data is warranted. Chronic HBV infection, estimated at 700,000-1.4 million of the U.S. population (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef07">7</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef08">8</a>), remains a major public health challenge. As the surveillance data from enhanced surveillance sites in this report indicate, about one-half of chronic HBV infections were among Asians/Pacific Islanders, and 63.9% of chronic HBV infections were among persons born outside of the United States. Other data indicate that approximately 47%-70% of chronic HBV-infected persons living in the United States were born in other countries (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef09">9</a>), and of foreign born persons living in the United States with chronic HBV infection, an estimated 58% migrated from Asia (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef08">8</a>). Further, the mortality data in this report show that Asians/Pacific Islanders are disproportionately dying with hepatitis B. Identifying these chronically infected persons and linking them to care is critical (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10">10</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef11">11</a>). In 2014, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) joined with CDC in recommending HBV testing for persons born in countries where&#160; HBV infection is endemic (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef12">12</a>). There were 3,050 cases of acute hepatitis B reported in 2013. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and &#160;under-reporting (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02">2</a>), the estimated number of new HBV infections was 19,764.</p>

<p>After receiving reports of approximately 800-1,000 cases of acute hepatitis C each year from 2006-2010, there was a significant increase of 151.5% in reported cases of acute HCV infection from 2010 to 2013.&#160; Cases of acute HCV infection rose from 850 in 2010 to 1,229 in 2011 to 1,778 in 2012 and then to 2,138 in 2013. The increase from 2010-2013 is thought to reflect both true increases in incidence and improved case ascertainment. Based on these data and epidemiologic studies, new cases of HCV infection are predominately among young persons who are white, live in non-urban areas (particularly in Eastern and Midwestern states), have a history of injection drug use, and previously used opioid agonists such as oxycodone (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef13">13</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef14">14</a>). Improved ascertainment by Florida, Massachusetts, and New York, funded by CDC to conduct active surveillance, partially explains increased incidence in these sites.&#160; In other locations where the number of cases has increased very markedly, such as Indiana, Kentucky, and New Jersey, the increases have occurred without any federal support for investigation or follow-up, reflecting overall increases in incidence (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef15">15</a>) (Table 4.1). After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02">2</a>), an estimated 29,718 new HCV infections occurred in 2013.</p>

<p>Mortality among HCV-infected persons—primarily adults aged 55-64 years—is increasing (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef16">16</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef17">17</a>). In &#160;2007, the number of HCV-related deaths (n=15,106) exceeded the number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths (n=12,734) in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef16">16</a>) and has since continued to increase. In 2013, the number of HCV-related deaths increased to 19,368; more than one-half of these deaths occurred among persons aged 55-64 years. A major public health challenge is to increase the proportion of persons tested and the proportion of those who test positive who are referred for care and treatment (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10">10</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef11">11</a>). To address this challenge, in 2013, the USPSTF joined with CDC in recommending one-time screening for HCV infection to adults born between 1945 and 1965 (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef18">18</a>).</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="background" name="background" title="Background"> </a>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Viral hepatitis is caused by infection with any of at least five distinct viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Most viral hepatitis infections in the United States are attributable to HAV, HBV, and HCV. All three of these unrelated viruses can produce an acute illness characterized by nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and jaundice, although many of these acute infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild disease. Thus, many persons infected with HBV or HCV are unaware they are infected and have clinically silent infections for decades until developing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndA" name="bkgrndA"> </a>Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>Transmitted through the fecal-oral route, HAV is acquired primarily through close personal contact with an infected person and during foodborne outbreaks (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef19">19</a>). Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A does not cause chronic infection. Since 1995, effective vaccines to prevent HAV infection have been available in the United States, increasing the feasibility of eliminating indigenous transmission. In 1996, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended administration of hepatitis A vaccine to persons at increased risk for the disease, including international travelers, men who have sex with men (MSM), non-injection and injection-drug users (IDUs), and children living in communities with high rates of disease (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef20">20</a>). In 1999, ACIP expanded these recommendations to include children living in 11 states with average hepatitis A rates of <u>&#62;</u>20 cases per 100,000 population and recommended that vaccination be considered for children in an additional six states with rates of 10–20 cases per 100,000 population (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef21">21</a>). ACIP expanded these recommendations in 2006 to include routine vaccination of newborns in all 50 states (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef04">4</a>).</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndB" name="bkgrndB"> </a>Hepatitis B</h3>

<p>HBV is transmitted by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to the blood or body fluids of an infected person, from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth, through close contact within households, through unscreened blood transfusion or unsafe injections in health care settings, through injection drug use, and from sexual contact with an infected person. Adults with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of acquiring HBV infection. Therefore, these persons are recommended to receive hepatitis B vaccination if younger than 60 years of age and to be considered for vaccination if aged 60 years or older (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef22">22</a>).</p>

<p>The risk for chronic HBV infection decreases with increasing age at infection. Of infants who acquired HBV infection from their mothers at birth, as many as 90% become chronically infected, whereas 30%–50% of children infected at age 1–5 years become chronically infected. This percentage is smaller among adults, in whom approximately 5% of all acute HBV infections progress to chronic infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef23">23</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef24">24</a>).</p>

<p>Effective vaccines to prevent HBV infection have been available in the United States since 1981. Ten years later, a comprehensive strategy was recommended for the elimination of HBV transmission in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef25">25</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef26">26</a>). This strategy encompassed the following four components:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Universal vaccination of infants beginning at birth;</li>

<li>Prevention of perinatal HBV infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBV infection and the provision of immunoprophylaxis to infants born either to infected women or to women of unknown infection status;</li>

<li>Routine vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents; and</li>

<li>Vaccination of adults at increased risk for infection (including health-care workers, dialysis patients, adults with diabetes, household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection, recipients of certain blood products, persons with a recent history of having multiple sex partners concurrently, those infected with a sexually transmitted disease, men who have sex with men [MSM], and injection drug users).</li>
</ul>

In addition to hepatitis B vaccination, efforts have been made to improve care and treatment for persons who are living with hepatitis B. In the United States, 700,000-1.4 million persons are estimated to be infected with the virus (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef07">7</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef27">27</a>), many of whom are unaware of their infection status (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10">10</a>). To improve health outcomes for these persons, CDC issued recommendations in 2008 to guide HBV testing and public health management of persons with chronic HBV infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef09">9</a>). These guidelines stress the need for testing persons at high risk for infection, conducting contact management, educating patients, and administering FDA-approved therapies for treating hepatitis B. Other recent guidelines address the appropriate management of chronic HBV infection in surgeons, other health care workers, and students (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef28">28</a>).

<h3><a id="bkgrndC" name="bkgrndC"> </a>Hepatitis C</h3>

<p>HCV is transmitted primarily through percutaneous (parenteral) exposure that can result from injection drug use, needle stick injuries, and inadequate infection control in health-care settings. Much less often, HCV transmission occurs among HIV-positive persons, especially MSM, as a result of sexual contact with an HCV-infected partner (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef29">29</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef30">30</a>), among persons who receive tattoos in unregulated settings (30), and among infants born to HCV-infected mothers (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef31">31</a>). After adjustment for populations not sampled in the NHANES household surveys (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef32">32</a>), such as incarcerees and the homeless, there are an estimated 3.2 million chronically HCV-infected persons in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef11">11</a>).</p>

<p>A single positive anti-HCV result cannot distinguish between acute and chronic HCV infection or between current or cleared HCV infection. Approximately 75%-85% of newly infected adults and adolescents develop chronic infection and making this distinction requires a health department to follow-up with a provider to determine if there were symptoms for reporting purposes. &#160;Laboratory criteria in the 2012 case definition for past or present HCV infection require one or more of the following: anti-HCV positive (repeatedly reactive) by EIA, verified by at least one more specific assay, or HCV RIBA positive, or HCV nucleic acid test (NAT) positive, or anti-HCV screening-test positive with an assay-specific signal-to-cutoff ratio predictive of a true case. In 2013, the RIBA test was phased out in the United States and the revised testing algorithm has been published (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef33">33</a>). This assessment requires, on average, review of at least 4 records by hepatitis surveillance staff&#160;in health departments (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef34">34</a>). No clinical symptoms are required; however, the case must be known to not be an acute case.</p>

<p>Because of the high burden of current HCV infection in the United States and because no vaccine is available for preventing infection, national recommendations (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef35">35</a>) emphasize other primary prevention activities, including screening and testing blood donors, inactivating HCV in plasma-derived products, testing persons at risk for HCV infection and providing them with risk-reduction counseling, and consistently implementing and practicing infection control in health-care settings. In 2010, the FDA approved point-of-care tests for HCV infection, which meant that patients could receive HCV test results within the same visit and faster referral to care (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef36">36</a>). In 2012, CDC augmented existing risk-based recommendations for HCV testing by recommending one-time screening for HCV infection among all those born during 1945-1965 (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef37">37</a>). It is estimated that persons born during these years have a 3% prevalence of HCV antibodies, which is five times higher than the prevalence seen in adults born in other years. Of all persons living with HCV infection, about 75% were born during 1945-1965; a similar percentage of HCV-associated deaths can be attributed to this birth cohort (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef37">37</a>). The goal of birth-cohort HCV testing is to identify unrecognized infections among the segment of the population with the largest risk of HCV-associated morbidity and mortality, thereby increasing opportunities for persons infected with HCV to benefit from appropriate care and treatment.</p>

Linkage to care and treatment is critical to improving health outcomes for persons found to be infected with HCV. Such linkage is particularly important in light of the major advancements that have been made in HCV treatments. For patients infected with HCV, treatment has previously consisted of pegylated interferon combined with oral doses of ribavirin (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef38">38</a>). Approximately 40%-50% of HCV-infected patients receiving this therapy cleared their infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef38">38</a>). However, HCV treatment improved drastically in 2011 with the development of the initial direct-acting oral agents, telaprevir and boceprevir, which were capable of achieving a sustained virologic response rate of <u>&#62;</u>80% (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef38">38</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef39">39</a>). These two drugs were available during the reporting period in 2013 that this Surveillance Report covers, but are now discontinued in the United States because of the development of newer all-oral direct-acting antiviral agents. In 2013, the FDA approved the use of simeprevir and sofosbuvir (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef40">40</a>). When given in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin or together as an all-oral combination regimen for a shorter duration of 8-12 weeks, these agents &#160;increase virologic cure rates to <u>&#62;</u>90% (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef41">41</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef42">42</a>). In 2014, two new all-oral regimens, Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) and Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir, and ritonavir tablets; dasabuvir tablets), were licensed for the treatment of HCV. These four agents are now the standard-of-care for HCV treatment in the United States. &#160;Evidence-based guidance is available from AASLD/IDSA to assist providers caring for HCV-infected patients (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef41">43</a>). The AASLD/IDSA HCV guidance is continuously updated to incorporate new information regarding HCV testing, linkage to care, and treatment (<a href="http://www.hcvguidelines.org/">http://www.hcvguidelines.org</a>).

<h3><a id="infoSources" name="infoSources"> </a>Sources of Information</h3>

<p>CDC relies on several sources of information to determine the incidence, prevalence, trends, and burden of hepatitis A, B, and C disease.</p>

<h3><a id="techNat" name="techNat"> </a>National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)</h3>

<u><strong>Background</strong></u>
<p>The basis for most case-reports is passive surveillance through the <em>National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)</em><strong>.</strong> State and local health departments report acute hepatitis A, B and C (incident cases) through this system. However, a number of states do not report cases of chronic hepatitis B and C through the NNDSS. Collecting, verifying and reporting the many chronic cases of hepatitis B and C in the United States (estimated at over 4 million) are beyond the capability of many health departments. Reports of chronic hepatitis B and C are included in this Surveillance Summary from <em>NNDSS</em> from states that gave permission for CDC to publish those counts.</p>

<p>Each week, state and territorial health departments report cases of acute, symptomatic viral hepatitis to CDC’s NNDSS. Since 1990, states have been electronically submitting individual case-reports (absent of personal identifiers) to CDC. States’ participation in reporting nationally notifiable diseases, including viral hepatitis, is voluntary.</p>

<p>National surveillance for viral hepatitis (including acute hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C; chronic hepatitis B; and chronic [past or present] hepatitis C) is based on case definitions developed and approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC. Reported cases of acute and chronic viral hepatitis are required to meet the following clinical and laboratory criteria (available at: <a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&amp;Yr=2012">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&#38;Yr=2012</a>). &#160;However, these criteria are evaluated at state or local health departments and are not validated by CDC. Although states may classify cases as confirmed, probable, and suspect, only confirmed cases of acute viral hepatitis are presented in this report.</p>

<strong>Adjustments to Reported Cases from NNDSS</strong>
<p>To better estimate the incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, and C in the United States, CDC recently undertook an analysis to recalculate the multipliers that had been used previously to account for under-ascertainment and under-reporting. A model was developed and tested that factored in the probability of symptoms (I), referral to care and treatment (II), and rates of reporting to local and state health departments (III). Results of the analysis indicated that reported cases represent an estimated one of every 1.95 hepatitis A cases, one of every 6.48 acute hepatitis B cases, and one of every 13.90 acute hepatitis C cases (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef43">2</a>). Accordingly, to obtain the estimated number of acute hepatitis A, B, and C after accounting for under-ascertainment and &#160;under-reporting, these new estimators were first applied to the acute hepatitis case data from NNDSS in the 2011 Surveillance Summary and will continue to be applied to future annual surveillance summaries, including in this report. These estimates cannot be used to deduce trends by comparison with estimations obtained in years prior to 2011, as earlier estimates were based on different (and unpublished) calculations; still, trends in reported cases can be evaluated, for example, the trend in the increase in acute hepatitis C that was first observed in 2011 among nationally reported cases.</p>

<h3><a id="enhancedSites" name="enhancedSites"> </a>Enhanced Viral Hepatitis Surveillance Sites</h3>

<u><strong>Background</strong></u>
<p>In November 2012, CDC funded seven health departments to conduct enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance through a three-year CDC funding agreement.&#160; All chronic cases of viral hepatitis obtained through these sites are de-duplicated. Additionally, for a sample of cases and in some sites such as New York State, all cases, follow-up case investigation is conducted by health departments to obtain clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological information, including risk behaviors and exposures. Each quarter, a dataset of cumulative cases from each site was sent to CDC through the CDC Secure Access Management System, a secure electronic file transfer portal.</p>

<u><strong>Methods</strong></u>
<p>In 2013, CDC funded four states (Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, and Washington), two cities (Philadelphia and San Francisco), and 57 counties in New York State to conduct ‘enhanced’ – that is, active – viral hepatitis surveillance, representing a combined population of approximately 35.6 million persons. In each of these jurisdictions, clinical laboratories were mandated to submit laboratory reports from persons with positive HBV and HCV test results to state or local health departments. Participating health departments routinely review each report to assess whether the current case definitions were met as established by CSTE and CDC. To determine whether a case is new, each site matches new case-reports to existing cases in the surveillance registry using personal identifying information. New cases are added to an electronic registry, whereas duplicate cases are used to update previous reports. Most health departments collect basic demographic data (e.g., age and sex) from the laboratory reports. Efforts vary by site regarding the level of investigation undertaken to collect and store supplemental information (e.g., risk factor data) from patients or their providers.</p>

<p>Data analyses from participating enhanced surveillance sites presented in this surveillance report were conducted on all serologically-confirmed cases of chronic hepatitis B and chronic (past or present) hepatitis C infection reported for the year 2013. Rates were calculated using appropriate jurisdiction-specific (state, county, or city) 2013 population estimates obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>

<p><u><strong>Limitations</strong></u></p>

<p>The number of cases of chronic HBV infection and past or present HCV infection from participating enhanced surveillance sites included in this report is likely an underestimate of the true burden of disease because cases of chronic infection are generally asymptomatic and less likely to be identified and reported. Additionally, data from these sites are not representative of the U.S. population, and because not all sites conduct comprehensive follow-up, data regarding race/ethnicity, place of birth, and risk are missing for some case-reports.</p>

<h3><a id="techMort" name="techMort"> </a>Mortality/Death Certificates</h3>

<u><strong>Background</strong></u>
<p>Death certificates are completed for all deaths registered in the United States. Information from death certificates is provided by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, and certificates are filed in vital statistics offices within each state and the District of Columbia. Through a program called the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef44">44</a>), information from death certificates is compiled by CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to produce national multiple-cause-of-death (MCOD) data (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef44">44</a>); causes of death are coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef45">45</a>). MCOD data are used to determine the national burden of mortality associated with viral hepatitis and to characterize decedents.<br />
A major study of these records from 1999-2007 showed that the annual number of deaths among HCV-infected persons exceeded the annual number of deaths among HIV-infected persons since 2007 (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef16">16</a>). Another study showed that fewer than 20% of HCV-infected decedents have HCV listed on their death certificate, even though 75% or more had pre-mortem evidence of serious liver disease&#160; (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef17">17</a>).</p>

<u><strong>Methods</strong></u>
<p>We obtained and analyzed 2009-2013 national multiple-cause mortality data through NVSS. The following case definitions were used to identify a death associated with hepatitis A, B, and C.<br />
Any death record with a report of any of the following ICD-10 codes listed as the underlying or one of the multiple (e.g., contributing) causes of death in the record axis:</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Hepatitis A (ICD-10: B15),</li>

<li>Hepatitis B (ICD-10: B16, B17.0, B18.0, and B18.1), or</li>

<li>Hepatitis C (ICD-10: B17.1 and B18.2).</li>
</ul>

<p>Demographic information on age, race/ethnicity, and sex were examined. Deaths were divided into six age categories: 0–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and <u>&#62;</u>75 years. Race categories prior to 2010 consisted of white (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), and non-black, non-white (which included all other racial and ethnic groups). Beginning in 2010, race/ethnicity was examined and consisted of the following categories: White, non-Hispanic, Black, non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) to be consistent with those used by the Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH). To calculate national mortality rates, the number of deaths associated with each type of hepatitis was divided by the total U.S. Census population for each demographic characteristic. Rates on race/ethnicity, sex, and overall total were standardized to the age distribution of the U.S. standard population in 2000 (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef46">46</a>).</p>

<u><strong>Interpretation of Mortality Data</strong></u>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Differences in recording practices of death certificate information may cause misclassification of ICD-10 codes and demographic information.</li>

<li>Certain racial/ethnic populations likely are underrepresented in US Census data (the denominator for calculating rates), potentially causing overestimated rates for these populations.</li>

<li>Analyses do not adjust for deaths resulting from undiagnosed viral hepatitis infections.</li>

<li>Death records listing more than one type of viral hepatitis infection were counted once for each type of infection. For example, a death with ICD-10 codes for both hepatitis B and C virus infections is counted once as a hepatitis B death and once as a hepatitis C death.</li>

<li>Before 2010, the race category designated as “non-white/non-black” included all other racial groups (e.g., APIs, AI/ANs, and persons who are Hispanic). This lack of specificity limits race-specific interpretation of mortality data prior to 2010.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="investigationOutbreaks" name="investigationOutbreaks"> </a>Investigation of Healthcare-Associated Outbreak Cases</h3>

<p>In 2013, CDC participated in two state-based investigations of healthcare-associated outbreaks of viral hepatitis infection, one involving HBV infection and one involving HCV infection. Additional information may be found at the following link that summarizes known outbreaks that occurred during 2008-2014 (available at: <a href="../healthcareoutbreaktable.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/Statistics/HealthcareOutbreakTable.htm</a>).</p>

<br />
<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="hepatitisA" name="hepatitisA" title="Hepatitis A"> </a>HEPATITIS A</h2>

<h3>Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>Historically, hepatitis A rates vary cyclically, with nationwide increases every 10-15 years. The last peak was in 1995; since that time, rates of hepatitis A generally declined until 2011. In 2013, a total of 1,781 cases of hepatitis A were reported from 50 states to CDC (Table 2.1), a 14% increase from 2012. This reflects cases ascertained during a large hepatitis A outbreak from imported pomegranate arils consumed by persons in several southwestern states and Hawaii (6). The overall incidence rate in 2013 was 0.6 cases per 100,000 population. After adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, an estimated 3,473 hepatitis A cases occurred in 2013. (Data for 2013 were unavailable for the District of Columbia.)</p>

<h4>2012 CSTE/CDC Case Definition (NNDSS)</h4>

<p><strong>Clinical Description&#160;</strong><br />
Acute hepatitis is defined as acute illness with 1) discrete onset of symptoms (e.g., fever, headache, malaise, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain) and 2) jaundice, or elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels.</p>

<p><strong>Laboratory Criteria&#160;</strong><br />
Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) positive.</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="discussion" name="discussion" title="Discussion"> </a>Discussion</h2>

<p>National surveillance data for acute viral hepatitis provide essential information for identifying patterns and trends in viral hepatitis; providing data for national and local estimates of the health burden of hepatitis A, B, and C; targeting groups for whom public health intervention is needed; and evaluating intervention efforts. National rates for acute hepatitis A and B have been published since 1966, and national rates for acute hepatitis C (formerly non-A, non-B) have been published since 1992. Major changes in the epidemiology of these diseases have occurred since reporting of these infections was initiated, largely resulting from implementation of prevention strategies, including the introduction of effective vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</p>

<p>NNDSS, the core of viral hepatitis surveillance, was designed to enable states to notify CDC of infectious diseases diagnosed with a single positive laboratory test. Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis B and C do not fit this pattern, as additional information beyond a single laboratory test is required to confirm a case (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef34">34</a>). To better count and characterize cases of viral hepatitis and estimate the burden of disease, CDC supplements NNDSS data with data obtained from select funded sites, national surveys, and vital statistics.</p>

<p>Data from NNDSS reveal an increase of: 27.4% in the number of reported cases of hepatitis A from 2011-2013, 5.4% in the number of reported cases of acute hepatitis B from 2012-2013, and 151.5% in the number of reported cases of acute hepatitis C from 2010-2013. These increases are likely explained by the increases in foodborne outbreaks associated with hepatitis A and drug-related and healthcare-related outbreaks associated with acute hepatitis B and C. In 2013, after adjusting for under-ascertainment and under-reporting, the estimated number of cases of HAV, HBV, and HCV infections was 3,473, 19,764, and 29,718, respectively. As noted in “Adjustments to Reported Cases in NNDSS”, these estimates cannot be compared directly with estimates from years prior to 2011, which were based on different methods of calculation.</p>

<p>In addition to the recent increases in reported cases of acute hepatitis A, B, and C, chronic hepatitis infection continues to affect millions of Americans (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef07">7</a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef32">32</a>). In 2013, over 30,000 reports of chronic hepatitis B and over 132,000 reports of chronic hepatitis C were submitted to CDC through NNDSS. Of these, 16,044 reports of chronic hepatitis B infection and 79,542 reports of chronic hepatitis C infections were available for descriptive analyses. Mortality data from 2013 presented in this surveillance report show certain socio-demographic groups to be disproportionately dying with these infections, specifically, persons aged <u>&#62;</u>55 years for hepatitis A; Asians/Pacific Islanders and persons aged 55-64 years for hepatitis B; and persons aged 55-64 years for hepatitis C. Mortality rates in 2013 were highest among persons infected with HCV (5.03 deaths per 100,000 population) and increased from the previous year, followed by HBV (0.52 deaths per 100,000 population), and HAV (0.02 deaths per 100,000 population).</p>

<p>CDC and state health departments rely on surveillance data to track the incidence of acute infection, guide development and evaluation of programs and policies designed to prevent infection and minimize the public health impact of viral hepatitis, and monitor progress towards achieving goals established for these programs and policies. Effective systems for conducting surveillance for chronic HBV and HCV infections are needed to ensure accurate reporting of all cases and to support and evaluate prevention activities. Additional investments in surveillance at the local, state, and national levels are essential to build strong prevention programs that interrupt transmission of viral hepatitis and improve the health of those who are currently infected.</p>
