<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="summary" name="summary" title="Summary"> </a>SUMMARY</h2>

<p>As part of CDC’s National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS), viral hepatitis case-reports are received electronically from state health departments via CDC’s National Electronic Telecommunications System for Surveillance (NETSS), a computerized public health surveillance system that provides CDC with data regarding cases of nationally notifiable diseases on a weekly basis. Although surveillance infrastructure is in place for reporting of acute infection, reports of chronic hepatitis B and C, which account for the greatest burden of disease, are not submitted by all states. As noted in a report from the Institute of Medicine (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef01"><em>1</em></a>), surveillance capacity to monitor both acute and chronic viral hepatitis is limited at the state and local levels, resulting in underreporting and variable data quality.</p>

<p>Data in this report should be interpreted with the consideration that reported cases of acute or chronic viral hepatitis represent only those relatively few infected persons who were detected, diagnosed, met a stringent case definition, and eventually reported to CDC in 2012. Because most acute and chronic infections are not reported, this Summary is mainly useful in detecting major trends in viral hepatitis A (HAV), B (HBV) and C (HCV). In 2011 and 2012 a major effort was undertaken to improve methodologies for estimating total number of new cases of hepatitis A, B and C from the number of cases reported for each disease (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02"><em>2</em></a>). Estimates in this report of incidence of new infections were obtained using the newly improved methodology (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02"><em>2</em></a>). These estimates cannot be compared to previous years’ estimates that were obtained using different (unpublished) procedures; however, trends seen in reported data still pertain, such as the increase in acute HCV infection among young persons that was observed in 2011.</p>

<p>Because chronic HBV and HCV infection are largely hidden and part of what the former United States Assistant Secretary for Health, Dr. Howard Koh has dubbed the “Silent Epidemic” (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef03"><em>3</em></a>), this report also provides data to inform our understanding of the current epidemic of chronic hepatitis B and C.</p>

<p>With progressive infant vaccination recommendations since 1996—and universal infant vaccination since 2006--vaccination rates and evidence of vaccine-induced immunity in young patients have been increasing continuously in the past decade (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef04"><em>4</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef05"><em>5</em></a>). Half of all hepatitis A infections now apparently are acquired outside the United States by adult travelers (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef06"><em>6</em></a>). The major public health demands regarding hepatitis A relate to newly discovered HAV-infected food handlers, as these place a large burden on local public health departments to notify, test, and vaccinate potentially infected restaurant patrons (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef06"><em>7</em></a>). There were 1,562 reported cases of acute HAV in 2012. After asymptomatic infections and under-reporting were taken into account (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02"><em>2</em></a>), it was estimated that approximately 3,050 new infections occurred in 2012.</p>

<p>Acute hepatitis B has been declining in incidence since 1990 mainly due to effective vaccination strategies, but chronic HBV infection, estimated at 700,000-1.4 million of the US population (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef08"><em>8</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef07"><em>9</em></a>), remains a major public health challenge. As the surveillance data in this report and other data indicate, about one-half of all chronic HBV infections are among persons born in Asia and Asian-Americans who were born to HBV-infected mothers in the United States. Identifying these chronically infected persons and linking them to care remains a challenge (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10"><em>10</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef11"><em>11</em></a>). There were 2,895 cases of acute hepatitis B reported in 2012. After adjusting for asymptomatic infections and under-reporting (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02"><em>2</em></a>), the estimated number of new HBV infections was 18,760.</p>

<p>After receiving reports of approximately 800-1,000 cases of acute hepatitis C each year from 2006-2010, there was a significant increase of 45% in reported cases of acute HCV infection from 2010-2012, and a 75% increase from 2010-2012.&#160; Cases of acute HCV infection rose from 850 in 2010 to 1,229 in 2011 and to 1,778 in 2012.&#160; After adjusting for asymptomatic infections and under-reporting (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef02"><em>2</em></a>), 21,870 new infections of HCV occurred in 2012. This increase is thought to reflect a trend in new cases among adolescents and young adults, particularly in Eastern and Midwestern states. Based on epidemiologic studies, these cases of HCV infection are predominately among young persons who are white, live in non-urban areas, have a history of injection drug use, and previously used opioid agonists such as oxycodone (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef12"><em>12</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef13"><em>13</em></a>). Some of the increase in reported acute HCV infection reflects improved ascertainment by selected states and local health departments funded by CDC to investigate such cases more actively, for example Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Wisconsin, and Philadelphia. &#160;However, in other locations where the number of cases has increased very markedly, such as Tennessee, West Virginia, and Kentucky, with over 20% of all new cases in the three states combined, the increases have occurred without any federal support for investigation or follow up (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef14"><em>14</em></a>) (Table 4.1).</p>

<p>Chronic HCV infection affects approximately 3.2 million US residents, after adjustment for homeless and incarcerated persons not captured in random household surveys (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10"><em>15</em></a>). However, prevalent chronic infections appear to be declining due, in part, to increasing mortality among HCV-infected persons—primarily adults aged 45 to 65 years—mortality that since 2007 has exceeded deaths from HIV/AIDS in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef16"><em>16</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef16"><em>17</em></a>). A major public health challenge is to increase the proportion of persons tested and the proportion of those who test positive who are referred for care and treatment (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef10"><em>10</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef11"><em>11</em></a>).</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="bkgrndI" name="bkgrndI" title="Background"> </a>BACKGROUND</h2>

<p>Viral hepatitis is caused by infection with any of at least five distinct viruses: hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), and hepatitis E virus (HEV). Most viral hepatitis infections in the United States are attributable to HAV, HBV, and HCV. All three of these unrelated viruses can produce an acute illness characterized by nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and jaundice, although many of these acute infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild disease. Thus, many persons infected with HBV or HCV are unaware they are infected and have clinically silent infections for decades until developing cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, or hepatocellular carcinoma.</p>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="bkgrndA" name="bkgrndA" title="Hepatitis A"> </a>Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>Transmitted through the fecal-oral route, HAV is acquired primarily through close personal contact and foodborne outbreaks (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef18"><em>18</em></a>). Since 1995, effective vaccines to prevent HAV infection have been available in the United States, increasing the feasibility of eliminating indigenous transmission. In 1996, CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended administration of hepatitis A vaccine to persons at increased risk for the disease, including international travelers, men who have sex with men (MSM), non-injection and injection-drug users (IDUs), and children living in communities with high rates of disease (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef19"><em>19</em></a>). In 1996, ACIP also recommended routine vaccination for children living in 11 states with average hepatitis A rates of <u>&#62;</u>20 cases per 100,000 population and recommended that vaccination be considered for children in an additional six states with rates of 10–20 cases per 100,000 population (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef20"><em>20</em></a>). ACIP expanded these recommendations in 2006 to include routine vaccination of newborns in all 50 states (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef04"><em>4</em></a>).</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndB" name="bkgrndB"> </a>Hepatitis B</h3>

<p>HBV is transmitted by percutaneous or mucosal exposure to the blood or body fluids of an infected person, from an infected mother to her newborn during childbirth, through close contact within households, through unscreened blood transfusion or unsafe injections in health care settings, through injection-drug use, and from sexual contact with an infected person. Adults with diabetes mellitus are at an increased risk of acquiring HBV infection. These persons are recommended to receive hepatitis B vaccination if younger than 60 years of age and to be considered for vaccination if aged 60 years or older (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef21"><em>21</em></a>).</p>

<p>The risk for chronic HBV infection decreases with increasing age at infection. Of infants who acquire HBV infection from their mothers at birth, as many as 90% become chronically infected, whereas 30%–50% of children infected at age 1–5 years become chronically infected. This percentage is smaller among adults, in whom approximately 5% of all acute HBV infections progress to chronic infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef22"><em>22</em></a>).</p>

<p>Effective vaccines to prevent hepatitis B virus infection have been available in the United States since 1981. Ten years later, a comprehensive strategy was recommended for the elimination of HBV transmission in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef23"><em>23</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef24"><em>24</em></a>). This strategy encompassed the following four components:</p>

<ul>
<li>Universal vaccination of infants beginning at birth;</li>

<li>Prevention of perinatal HBV infection through routine screening of all pregnant women for HBV infection and the provision of immunoprophylaxis to infants born either to infected women or to women of unknown infection status;</li>

<li>Routine vaccination of previously unvaccinated children and adolescents; and</li>

<li>Vaccination of adults at increased risk for infection (including health-care workers, dialysis patients, household contacts and sex partners of persons with chronic HBV infection, recipients of certain blood products, persons with a recent history of having multiple sex partners concurrently, those infected with a sexually transmitted disease, men who have sex with men [MSM], and injection drug users).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to hepatitis B vaccination, efforts have been made to improve care and treatment for persons who are living with hepatitis B. In the United States, 700,000-1.4 million persons are estimated to be infected with the virus (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef08"><em>8</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef25"><em>25</em></a>), many of whom are unaware of their infection status (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef09"><em>10</em></a>). To improve health outcomes for these persons, CDC issued recommendations in 2008 to guide HBV testing and public health management of persons with chronic HBV infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef26"><em>26</em></a>). These guidelines stress the need for testing persons at high risk for infection, conducting contact management, educating patients, and administering FDA-approved therapies for treating hepatitis B.</p>

<h3><a id="bkgrndC" name="bkgrndC"> </a>Hepatitis C</h3>

<p>HCV is transmitted primarily through percutaneous (parenteral) exposure that can result from injection-drug use, needle-stick injuries, and inadequate infection control in health-care settings. Much less often, HCV transmission occurs among HIV-positive persons, especially MSM, as a result of sexual contact with an HCV-infected partner (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef27"><em>27</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef28"><em>28</em></a>), among persons who receive tattoos in unregulated settings (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef28"><em>28</em></a>), and among infants born to HCV-infected mothers (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef29"><em>29</em></a>). With an estimated 3.2 million chronically infected persons nationwide, HCV infection is the most common blood-borne chronic infection in the United States (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef15"><em>15</em></a>).</p>

<p>Currently a single positive anti-HCV result cannot distinguish between acute and chronic HCV infection, and making this distinction requires a health department to follow-up with a provider to determine if there were symptoms for reporting purposes. &#160;Laboratory criteria in the 2012 case definition for past or present HCV infection require one or more of the following: anti-HCV positive (repeatedly reactive) by EIA, verified by at least one more specific assay, or HCV RIBA positive, or HCV nucleic acid test (NAT) positive, or anti-HCV screening-test positive with an assay-specific signal-to-cutoff ratio predictive of a true case. This assessment requires, on average, review of at least 4 records by hepatitis surveillance staff&#160; in health departments (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef30"><em>30</em></a>) No clinical symptoms are required; however, the case must be known to not be an acute case. Approximately 75%-85% of newly infected persons develop chronic infection.</p>

<p>Because of the high burden of chronic HCV infection in the United States and because no vaccine is available for preventing infection, national recommendations (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef31"><em>31</em></a>) emphasize other primary prevention activities, including screening and testing blood donors, inactivating HCV in plasma-derived products, testing persons at risk for HCV infection and providing them with risk-reduction counseling, and consistently implementing and practicing infection control in health-care settings. In 2010, the FDA approved point-of-care tests for HCV infection, which meant that patients could receive HCV test results within the same visit and faster referral to care (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef32"><em>32</em></a>). In 2012, CDC augmented existing risk-based recommendations for HCV testing by recommending one-time screening for HCV infection among all those born during 1945-1965 (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef33"><em>33</em></a>). It is estimated that persons born during these years have a 3% prevalence of HCV antibodies, which is five times higher than the prevalence seen in adults born in other years. Of all persons living with HCV infection, about 75% were born during 1945-1965; a similar percentage of HCV-associated deaths can be attributed to this birth cohort (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef33"><em>33</em></a>). The goal of the new birth-cohort approach to HCV testing is to identify unrecognized infections among the segment of the population with the largest risk of HCV-associated morbidity and mortality, thereby increasing opportunities for persons infected with HCV to benefit from appropriate care and treatment. Implementation of the birth cohort screening recommendation and point of care testing for HCV infection will facilitate testing, notification of results, post-test counseling and referral to care.</p>

<p>Linkage to care and treatment is critical to improving health outcomes for persons found to be infected with HCV. Such linkage is particularly important in light of the major advancements that have been made in HCV treatments. For patients infected with HCV, treatment has previously consisted of pegylated interferon combined with oral doses of ribavirin, a regimen that has improved health outcomes for many infected persons. Approximately 40% of HCV-infected patients receiving this therapy clear their infection. New direct acting agents against HCV (telaprevir, boceprevir) were licensed by the FDA in 2011 and are now standard-of-care. These agents, when given in combination with current therapy, can increase virologic cure rates to 80% while decreasing duration of therapy (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef34"><em>34</em></a>). Several drugs are now administered orally (a major advancement in how treatments are administered for this infection), leading to viral suppression in 90% of patients taking one of these new oral medications (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef35"><em>35</em></a>, <a href="commentary.htm#techRef36"><em>36</em></a>).</p>

<h3><a id="caseClassification" name="caseClassification"> </a>Notes on “Case Classification”</h3>

<p>For analysis at the national level, cases of viral hepatitis are considered “confirmed” if they meet both the clinical case definition and laboratory criteria for diagnosis; however, these criteria are evaluated at the state or local level and are not validated by CDC. For hepatitis A, cases also are considered confirmed if they meet the clinical case definition and involve a person who is epidemiologically linked to someone with laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A (e.g., through household or sexual contact with an infected person or eating HAV-contaminated food or food prepared by an infected foodhandler during the 15–50 days before symptom onset).</p>

<h3><a id="infoSources" name="infoSources"> </a>Sources of Information</h3>

<p>CDC relies on several sources of information to determine the incidence, prevalence, trends, and burden of viral hepatitis A, B, and C disease. The basis for most case reports is passive surveillance through the <em>National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS)</em><strong>.</strong> State and local health departments report acute hepatitis A, B and C (incident cases) through this system. However, a number of states do not report cases of chronic hepatitis B and C through the NNDSS. Collecting, verifying and reporting the many chronic cases of hepatitis B and C in the United States (estimated at over 4 million) is beyond the capability of many health departments. Reports of chronic hepatitis B and C are included in this Surveillance Summary from <em>NNDSS</em> from states that gave permission for CDC to publish those counts. Severity and burden of viral hepatitis A, B and C disease are measured by information obtained from death certificates through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef37"><em>37</em></a>).</p>

<p>Surveillance activities also include the examination of other data sets which are not included in this report, such as the <em>National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)</em> and the <em>National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)</em>. Additional special studies, including the <em>National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),</em> which collects data from a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 non-institutionalized US residents each year, also are important in understanding the prevalence of chronic HCV infection (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef14"><em>14</em></a>; MM Denniston, manuscript submitted). Severity and burden of viral hepatitis A, B and C disease are measured by information obtained from death certificates through the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) (<a href="commentary.htm#techRef37"><em>37</em></a>).</p>

<h3><a id="techNat" name="techNat"> </a>National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS)</h3>

<h4><em>Background</em></h4>

<p>Each week, state and territorial health departments report cases of acute, symptomatic viral hepatitis to CDC’s NNDSS. Since 1990, states have been electronically submitting individual case reports (absent of personal identifiers) to CDC. States’ participation in reporting nationally notifiable diseases, including viral hepatitis, is voluntary.</p>

National surveillance for viral hepatitis (including acute hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C; chronic hepatitis B; and chronic [past or present] hepatitis C) is based on case definitions developed and approved by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC. In 2012, reported cases of acute and chronic viral hepatitis were required to meet the following CSTE-defined clinical and laboratory criteria (available at: &#160;
		<a href="http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&amp;Yr=2012">http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/script/ConditionList.aspx?Type=0&amp;Yr=2012</a>
	&#160;).

<h3><em>Methods</em></h3>

<p>We analyzed national multiple-cause mortality data collected during 2007–2011 (the most recent data-years available) obtained from NCHS. The following case definitions were used to identify a death associated with hepatitis A, B, or C.</p>

<p>Any death record with a report of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hepatitis A (ICD-10: B15),</li>

<li>Hepatitis B (ICD-10: B16, B17.0, B18.0, and B18.1), or</li>

<li>Hepatitis C (ICD-10: B17.1 and B18.2) listed as the underlying or one of the multiple (e.g., contributing) causes of death in the record axis.</li>
</ul>

Demographic information on age, race, and sex were examined. Deaths were divided into six age categories: 0–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and <u>&#62;</u>75 years. Race categories for 2006-2009 consisted of white (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), black (Hispanic and non-Hispanic), and non-black, non-white (which included all other racial and ethnic groups). For 2010, race/ethnicity categories consisted of white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) to be consistent with those used by Division of Viral Hepatitis (DVH). To calculate national mortality rates, the number of deaths was divided by the total US Census population for each demographic subgroup. Rates on race, sex, and overall total were standardized to the age distribution of the US population in 2000 ( <a href="commentary.htm#techRef40"><em>40</em></a>). Data were analyzed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute; Cary, NC).

<h4><em>Interpretation of Mortality Data</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>Differences in recording practices of death certificate information may cause misclassification of ICD-10 codes and demographic information.</li>

<li>Certain racial/ethnic populations likely are underrepresented in US Census data (the denominator for calculating rates), potentially causing overestimated rates for these populations.</li>

<li>Analyses do not adjust for deaths resulting from undiagnosed viral hepatitis infections.</li>

<li>Death records listing more than one type of viral hepatitis infection were counted once for each type of infection. For example, a death with ICD-10 codes for both hepatitis B and C virus infections is counted once as a hepatitis B death and once as a hepatitis C death.</li>

<li>The race category designated as “non-white/non-black” includes all other race groups (e.g., APIs, AI/ANs, and persons who are Hispanic). This lack of specificity limits race-specific interpretation of mortality data prior to 2010.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="invest" name="invest"> </a>Investigations of Acute Cases</h3>

<p>In 2012, CDC participated in 2 state-based investigations of outbreaks of viral hepatitis infection, one involving HBV and one involving HCV infection. Additional information may be found at the following link that summarizes known outbreaks 2008-2013.</p>

<h3><a id="adjustments" name="adjustments"> </a>Adjustments to Reported Cases</h3>

<p>CDC has reanalyzed the estimators (multipliers) traditionally used to convert reported cases to estimated (true) incidence of acute hepatitis A, B, and C in the United States. Briefly, this review and analysis has been of more recent data that allow better estimation of the numbers and percentages of acute viral hepatitis cases who have symptoms, seek medical care, and get reported to local, state and federal health authorities (1). A probabilistic model factored probabilities of symptoms (I), referral to care and treatment (II), and rates of reporting to local and state health department (III). This analysis indicated that reported cases represent an estimated one of 1.95 acute hepatitis A; one of 6.48 hepatitis B; and one of 12.30 hepatitis C cases1. Accordingly, these estimators are used in this Surveillance Summary. These estimates cannot be used to deduce trends by comparison with estimations obtained in previous years as earlier estimates were obtained from different (and unpublished) calculations; trends are best evaluated in reported cases, as in the increase in acute HCV in 2012 among nationally reported cases.</p>

<h3>Acute Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>There were 1,562 reported cases of acute hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection in 2012, representing an estimated 3,050 cases.</p>

<br />
<h4><em>Case Definition</em></h4>

<br />
<h4><em>Clinical Description</em></h4>

Acute hepatitis is defined as acute illness with 1) discrete onset of symptoms (e.g., nausea, anorexia, fever, malaise, and abdominal pain) and 2) jaundice, dark urine, or elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &#62;200 IU/L.

<h4><em>Laboratory Criteria for Acute Hepatitis A</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) positive.</li>
</ul>

<br />
<h3>Acute Hepatitis A</h3>

<p>Historically, acute hepatitis A rates vary cyclically, with nationwide increases every 10-15 years. The last peak was in 1995; since that time, rates of hepatitis A have generally declined. In 2012, a total of 1,562 cases of acute hepatitis A were reported nationwide to CDC (Table 2.1). The overall incidence rate for 2012 was 0.5 cases per 100,000 population. No data were available for 2012 from the District of Columbia.</p>

<h3>Acute Hepatitis C</h3>

<p>In 2012, a total of 41 states submitted 1,778 reports of acute hepatitis C to CDC (Table 4.1). The overall incidence rate for 2012 was 0.6 cases per 100,000 population, an increase from 0.3 cases per 100,000 population during 2006-2010. Data for 2012 were unavailable from Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, South Dakota ,and Wyoming.</p>

<h3>Hepatitis C, Past or Present</h3>

<p>The current case definition for hepatitis C cases, other than acute cases, requires as little as a single positive anti-HCV test and that the case does not meet the case definition for acute infection. Because no single current anti-HCV test can distinguish current active infections (present) from resolved infections (past), these cases are reported in a single category, hepatitis C, past or present.<br />
&#160;</p>

<h4><em>Case Definition</em></h4>

<br />
<h4><em>Clinical Criteria</em></h4>

<p>No symptoms are required. Most HCV-infected persons are asymptomatic; however, many have mild-to-severe chronic liver disease.</p>

<h4><em>Laboratory Criteria</em></h4>

<p>One or more of the following three criteria (except in persons less than 18 months of age, for whom only criteria 3 would meet the case classification criteria):</p>

<ul type="disc">
<li>Antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) screening-test-positive with a signal to cut-off ratio predictive of a true positive as determined for the particular assay as defined by CDC. (URL for the signal to cut-off ratios: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/labtesting.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HCV/LabTesting.htm</a>&#160;), OR</li>

<li>Hepatitis C virus recombinant immunoblot assay (HCV RIBA) positive, OR</li>

<li>Nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA positive (including qualitative, quantitative or genotype testing).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Case Classification</strong></p>

<p><strong>Probable</strong><br />
A case that does not meet the case definition for acute hepatitis C, is anti-HCV positive (repeat reactive) by EIA, and has alanine aminotransferase (ALT or SGPT) values above the upper limit of normal, but the anti-HCV EIA result has not been verified by an additional more specific assay or the signal to cut-off ratio is unknown.</p>

<p><strong>Confirmed</strong></p>

A case that is laboratory confirmed and does not meet the case definition for acute hepatitis C.

<ul>
<li>In 2012, a total of 145,762 reports of chronic hepatitis C (past or present) infection were submitted to CDC by 44 states.</li>

<li>Sixteen jurisdictions agreed to publication of their NNDSS data for this report, representing 44.1% (n=64,370) of all reports of chronic hepatitis C received by CDC in 2012.</li>

<li>From 2007 through 2011, the mortality rate of hepatitis C increased from 4.6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2007 to 4.8 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011.</li>

<li>In 2007, the highest mortality rates were observed among persons aged 45–54 years and 55-64 years and the rates were similar (13.5 and 15.7 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively).</li>

<li>From 2007 through 2011, mortality rates of persons with hepatitis C increased 39% among persons aged 55–64 years to a rate of 21.9 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011.</li>

<li>In 2011, the highest mortality rates of persons with hepatitis C by race/ethnicity and sex were observed among American Indians and Alaska Natives (10.6 deaths per 100,000 population) and males (7.1 deaths per 100,000 population) respectively.</li>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="disc" name="disc" title="Discussion"> </a>Discussion</h2>

<p>National surveillance data for acute viral hepatitis provide essential information for identifying patterns and trends in viral hepatitis; providing data for national and local estimates of the health burden of hepatitis A, B, and C; targeting groups for whom public health intervention is needed; and evaluating intervention efforts. National rates for acute hepatitis A and B have been published since 1966, and national rates for acute hepatitis C (formerly non-A, non-B) have been published since 1992. Major changes in the epidemiology of these diseases have occurred since reporting of these infections was initiated, largely resulting from implementation of prevention strategies, including the introduction of effective vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</p>

<p>NNDSS, the core of viral hepatitis surveillance, was designed to enable states to notify CDC of infectious diseases diagnosed with a single positive laboratory test. Cases of acute and chronic hepatitis B and C do not fit this pattern, as additional information beyond a single laboratory test is required to confirm a case (<em>1</em>). To better count and characterize cases of viral hepatitis and estimate the burden of disease, CDC supplements NNDSS data with data obtained from select funded sites, national surveys, and vital statistics.</p>

<p>Data from NNDSS indicate declining rates of acute hepatitis A, acute hepatitis B, and acute hepatitis C during 1995–2010. More recent data show the rate of decline has decreased, and incidence has become relatively stable for acute hepatitis A and B, whereas a marked increase in the number of cases of acute hepatitis C was in 2011 and 2012. Still, most new infections with HAV, HBV, and HCV remain undetected and unreported. In 2012, after adjusting for asymptomatic cases and underreporting, the estimated number of cases of HAV, HBV, and HCV infections was approximately 3,050, 18,760, and 21,870, respectively. As noted in “Adjustments to Reported Cases” (page 16), these estimates cannot be compared directly with estimates from previous years which were based on different methods of calculation.</p>

<p>Despite decreases in acute viral hepatitis, chronic hepatitis infection continues to affect millions of Americans. In the United States, an estimated 700,000–1.4 million persons are living with chronic hepatitis B infection (<em>2, 3</em>), and an estimated 2.7–3.9 million persons are chronically infected with hepatitis C (<em>4</em>). In 2012, over 40,000 reports of chronic hepatitis B and over 145,000 reports of chronic hepatitis C were submitted to CDC through NNDSS. Of these, 24,950 reports of chronic hepatitis B infection and 64,370 reports of chronic hepatitis C infections were available for descriptive analyses. Mortality data from 2011, the latest year for which these data were available, reveal the serious health consequences associated with viral hepatitis: chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, was the 12th leading cause of death in the United States in 2011 (<em>5</em>). Viral hepatitis-associated death rates in 2011 were highest among persons infected with HCV (4.82 deaths per 100,000 population), followed by HBV (0.52 deaths per 100,000 population), and HAV (0.02 deaths per 100,000 population) (<em>6</em>).</p>

<p>CDC and state health departments rely on surveillance data to track the incidence of acute infection, guide development and evaluation of programs and policies designed to prevent infection and minimize the public health impact of viral hepatitis, and monitor progress towards achieving goals established for these programs and policies. Effective systems for conducting surveillance for chronic HBV and HCV infections are needed to ensure accurate reporting of all cases and to support and evaluate prevention activities. Additional investments in surveillance at the local, state, and national levels are essential to build strong prevention programs that interrupt transmission of viral hepatitis and improve the health of those who are already infected.</p>
