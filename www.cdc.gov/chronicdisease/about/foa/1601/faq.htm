<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Should the work plan also be in 12pt font as part of the Project Narrative, or can it be smaller? The template is in 11pt.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>: &#160;The work plan should be 12pt font.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Is it permissible to use 10pt font for charts and graphs within the application narrative?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; Yes, this is allowable.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Can you confirm whether or not the 12 point font requirement extends to footnotes? May we use a smaller font size for footnotes?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; You do not have to use 12pt font for footnotes.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; What quarterly timeline are we to use for the workplan? Is it the calendar quarters or the anticipated FY quarters for this funding opportunity?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; The quarterly timeline begins June 1.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Is there a page limit for the appendices?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; There is not a page limit to appendices.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: Can you confirm that student level health outcomes are not a required component of the evaluation for this RFA?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Correct, student outcomes are not required to be measured as part of the FOA.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Should the budget narrative for the proposal represent a 12-month budget period or the full 5-year of the cooperative agreement?&#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; The budget should reflect a 12-month budget period. For guidance on completing a detailed budget, see Budget Preparation Guidelines at: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/applicationresources.html">http://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/applicationresources.html</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; In the application package, you are required to input your numbers for the year, indicating the federal share each year/summarizing the line items.&#160;In previous cooperative agreement submissions, we’ve input the aggregate of all the projects- e.g. The sum total of all four priority areas would be shared in the application package itself.&#160;So if we are proposing $500K for Nutrition, $500K in Out of School Time, $500K in PE/PA and $500K in Sexual Health, the application package will reflect a total budget of $2,000,000 and we would summarize all the line items together for the purposes of the application package. &#160;Is that how we should handle it?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; Yes, you are correct.&#160;You can go to the SF424 Form and list each priority under Column “A”, on the Budget Information page. Example: A1.) Nutrition and the Total under Column G1.) $500,000. A2.) Out of School Time and the Total under Column G2.) &#160;$500,000 etc.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;The FOA says the Work Plan is included in the project narrative. &#160;Do you want us to upload a separate work plan table in an additional file using the Work Plan Template from the FOA page here: 
		<a href="../work-plan-temp.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/foa/work-plan-temp.htm</a>
	? &#160;Or should we paste that table into the Project Narrative?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;The work plan is included in the Project Narrative’s 20-page limit allocation. &#160;The work plan should be uploaded separately with the file labeled “Work Plan.Priority1.NameofAgency” as appropriate and uploaded as a PDF.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;We are applying for four priority areas and are preparing four separate applications for those areas. &#160;When I downloaded the grants.gov package, it has the standard submission option of one mandatory project narrative file with “optional project narrative files”. &#160;Can you tell me if we should submit all four priority area narratives as one PDF or should we expect to submit four separate packages in grants.gov under our name?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>You will need to submit four separate application files. You will submit the separate documents under the optional documents and clearly label as stated in FOA the different components. &#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;If we combine all four into one priority area, how do we handle the budget information in the Project Abstract Summary and Budget Information sections?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;Budget information should be specifically for the priority area (s) you are applying for.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;We cannot find the template for priority 5. &#160;We found template for the other priorities.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: &#160;</strong>There is only one standard template for all priority areas. You must edit the template yourself. Go to: 
		<a href="index.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/foa/1601/index.htm</a>
	 and click on “work plan” icon.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Does CDC need detailed budgets and narrative for years 2 through 5?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicants only need a detailed budget for year one. When developing the budget narrative, applicants must consider whether the proposed budget is reasonable and consistent with the purpose, outcome, and program strategies outlined in the project narrative.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;Can an applicant ask for differing amounts per year?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Yes, applicants can ask for differing amounts per year, within the parameters set out in the FOA. The average one year award is $375,000. The floor is $300,000 per budget period and the ceiling is $600,000 per budget period. This amount is subject to the availability of funds.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Regarding the Non-Construction clause- We have searched the codes and do not see how this applies to us for this specific proposal, but want to be sure we are not missing anything. Please confirm. “5. Will comply with the Intergovernmental Personnel Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. §§4728-4763) relating to prescribed standards for merit systems for programs funded under one of the 19 statutes or regulations specified in Appendix A of OPM's Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration (5 C.F.R. 900, Subpart F).”</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;Concerning the Assurance form under the Non-Construction clauses, certain of these assurances may not be applicable to your project or program.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>Our controller found documentation stating that this grant would not be subject to single audit, can you please confirm? “17. Will cause to be performed the required financial and compliance audits in accordance with the Single Audit Act Amendments of 1996 and OMB Circular No. A-133, ‘Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations.’”</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> To summarize number 17 under the Assurance, “an organization that expends $750,000 or more in a fiscal year in Federal awards shall have a single or program-specific audit conducted for that year in accordance with the provisions of 45 CFR Part 75.”</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;I am unable to access the 'sample work plan' document via the link embedded in the instructions doc. Is there any way you can direct me to another link or simply attach the doc in an email?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;Please refer to the following link: <a href="index.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/about/foa/1601/index.htm</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;Regarding the budget narrative, the instructions say that it can be scored in the 'Organizational Capacity of Awardees to Implement the Approach' section. Just to be clear, does the budget narrative count against the 20 page max limit for the project narrative section?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: &#160;</strong>The budget narrative does not count against the 20 page limit.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;I can't find any additional information regarding the 'program narrative' other than the short section on page 30. Can you point me in the right direction if there is any additional information?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> The program narrative is the same as the project narrative. The terms are used interchangeably.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Is there an existing annual gathering or conference for the grantees referenced in the FOA?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Post-award cooperative agreement monitoring and provision of technical assistance and training will include participation in webinars and grantee meetings. Dates are not yet determined.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;We are attempting to respond to CDC-RFA-DP16-1601. In doing so, we are having a terrible time understanding the page limits. Between the RFA and the response to questions, the guidance is contradictory. Would you be willing to clarify? We are attempting to reply to four of the content areas. How many pages do we get to respond to those four and what are the breakdowns?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: &#160;</strong>As noted on page 27 of the FOA: Maximum of 20 pages, single spaced, Calibri 12 point, 1-inch margins, number all pages. Content beyond 20 pages will not be considered. The 20 page limit includes the work plan. If an applicant is submitting for more than one priority area (content area), there is a maximum of 20 pages for each priority area.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;In the logic model, strategy one (professional development and technical assistance) includes three activities: a) creation of a “train the trainer” network, b) support development of action plans by constituents, and c) develop TA for CDC-funded grantees/constituents. Does CDC views these three activities as separate and distinctive efforts, or can they be integrated? In other words, can the action plans and TA delivery be developed as part of the train-the-trainer network activity? If you see them as separate, can you provide more guidance by what you mean by “convening constituents and stakeholders to develop action plans?”</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;The train-the-trainer network is distinct from the action plan piece. The convening of constituents is meant to focus on the organization’s members coming together to create detailed action plans. The applicant should indicate how they will address and implement all of the specific, separate strategies and how will those strategies help achieve performance measures.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;In the work plan, should the baseline for the performance measures reflect work done in the past, or only work done under this FOA (so it would be zero at this point)?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;You would start at zero for baseline because this is newly funded work.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Does this funding FOA require external evaluators to be utilized or could an applicant use internal capacity to conduct the evaluation activities?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;It is up to the applicant to determine who their evaluator(s) will be. &#160;Applicants must identify individuals responsible for planning and implementing the evaluation in their application.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Is there any possibility that the submission deadline might be pushed forward into later January? &#160;I am not sure about any other organizations responding to this RFA – but I am struggling with the timing of this response window – considering between the RFA release date and the submission deadline are four Federal holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year’s and MLK Day). &#160;&#160;Vacation schedules are so heavy during this timeframe. &#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;We apologize for the inconvenience, but the deadline cannot be moved. &#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;What NGOs are currently funded by the Division of Adolescent and School Health?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Advocates for Youth; American Psychological Association; Cicatelli Associates Inc (CAI); Gay-Straight Alliance Network; Healthy Teen Network; National Coalition of STD Directors.<br />
This funding announcement is a competitive funding announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;In the FOA for The National Collaboration to Promote Health, Wellness, and Academic Success of School-Age Children, there is reference made to National NGOs. Does this mean that the opportunity is only available to NGOs that work on a national scale? Also are NGOs required to do work involving every priority area? (Physical activity, Nutrition, etc.)</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;This FOA is intended to fund non-governmental organizations to establish and maintain policy, systems and environmental change strategies across the country to achieve desired outcomes. This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth. Applicants must address the organizational capacity requirements, including that the applicant is a national NGO which can identify representative constituencies (e.g., members, networks, affiliates, or chapters) within twenty-five or more states.<br />
Applicants do not have to work in every priority area.</p>

<p><strong>Question: &#160;</strong>What NGOs are currently funded by the School Health Branch?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;Action for Healthy Kids; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Association of School Administrators; American Cancer Society; Food Allergy Research and Education; National Association of Chronic Disease Directors; National Association of State Boards of Education; SHAPE America.<br />
This funding announcement is a competitive funding announcement.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> With regard to the eligibility for this FOA, can a national organizations’ constituents be defined as those state health departments, city/county health departments, local education agencies, and community-based health centers/organizations that the national organization (applicant) is currently funded (via federal and state grants) to provide services for?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Yes. It is up to the applicant to define who their constituents are and their relationship with those constituents.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;We would potentially be interested in applying under Priority 4. Can you please clarify whether or not the awardee will be expected to address the whole range of chronic conditions that children and schools face?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;The purpose of this FOA is to improve the health of youth by funding non-governmental organizations to assist CDC-funded grantees and the organization's constituents, including states, school districts or schools; to implement environmental and systems changes that support and reinforce healthful behaviors, reduce disparities, and address non-academic barriers to learning. This program announcement emphasizes training and professional development, technical assistance, education and dissemination, and program implementation and evaluation. All activities are to be developed and delivered within the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child framework. The intent of priority 4: School Health Services—Managing Chronic Conditions is to support school districts and schools with implementation of evidence-based policies, practices, and programs that improve the delivery of &#160;school health services and students’ management of chronic conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, food allergies, tooth decay, and seizure disorders. The intent is to fund one applicant within this priority area. The funded applicant should work within the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child model, to develop, implement, and evaluate the following specific activities.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Our organization is a leader in school health and is known especially in reproductive and sexual health in schools and communities. We are also a premier technical assistance, program development, and evaluation provider across many grantee content areas and have worked in all states and territories. And we are a registered Private Voluntary Organization (PVO). We would like to know if we would be eligible under the guidance in this opportunity if we submitted a proposal.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;This FOA is intended to fund non-governmental organizations to establish and maintain policy, systems and environmental change strategies across the country to achieve desired outcomes. This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth. Applicants must address the organizational capacity requirements, including that the applicant is a national NGO which can identify representative constituencies (e.g., members, networks, affiliates, or chapters) within twenty-five or more states. It is imperative you review the FOA, to determine:<br />
1. Are you eligible to apply per the Eligibility Qualification?<br />
2. Can you accomplish the goals that are expected, as stated under<br />
a. Approach<br />
b. Evaluation and Performance Measurement<br />
c. Applicant’s Organizational Capacity to Implement the Approach &#160;<br />
Applications that do not meet the eligibility criteria will not advance to the Phase II review. Applicants will be notified that their applications did not meet eligibility or published submission requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;I wanted to just get clarification on eligibility. On the RFA, it does seem that our organization is eligible. We are a non-profit working on policy, system, environmental change to increase access to physical activity and healthy food in and out of schools. We do this statewide and on a local level. On the call, it seemed as if you wanted national organizations to apply, however on the RFA I don’t see mention of that. We would not want to apply without being sure that our organization would be considered. &#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: &#160;</strong>This FOA is intended to fund non-governmental organizations to establish and maintain policy, systems and environmental change strategies across the country to achieve desired outcomes. This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth.

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;I am writing to inquire whether CDC prefers a brief letter of intent for this FOA or a more comprehensive letter of intent to apply that includes detailed proposal information. At this point in the process, I imagine that a simple letter of intent might be preferred, but wanted to make sure that we craft the most appropriate communication expected by CDC.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: &#160;</strong>The letter of intent is to provide CDC with an estimated number of applications. &#160;The LOI should state which priority area (s) they will be applying for.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;My organization intends to apply for a grant under this FOA, and we’ll be sending an LOI by December 15. We understand that our project will “assist CDC-funded grantees and the organization’s constituents, including states, school districts or schools…” CDC supports state health departments through several programs. Can you please clarify which of these is relevant to this FOA?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;It is up to the applicant to define who its constituents are and their relationship with those constituents.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;In the request, under Out of School Time Healthy Eating and Physical Activity, it asked that the awardee provides professional development to CDC-Funded grantees. Can this include volunteers at schools? Or must it be teachers and/or employees of the school district?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;It is up to the applicant to define who its constituents are and their relationship with those constituents.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;I’m reviewing the FOA for DP16-1601 National Collaboration to Support Health, Wellness and Academic Success of School-Age Children. My take-away about eligibility is that you’re looking for national NGOs. My sense is that you’re not looking for local non-profits who, although they may be successful in collaborating locally, do not have experience in reaching across multiple states (e.g., 25 states, as indicated in the FOA). We often partner with a local university that has experience in reaching across multiple states, but since educational institutions are not eligible applicants, I believe this may not be a best fit for our organization.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;I have a PI who is interested in submitting an LOI for this RFA. &#160;I don’t see any mention of length limitations. &#160;Are there any? &#160;Are there any general guidelines as to the formatting, i.e., section headings, should we adhere to the Calibri 12 pt. 1 inch margins as indicated for the actual parts of the proposal if the LOI is an email attachment? &#160;Or should it just be the body of the email?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The letter of intent is to provide CDC with an estimated number of applications. &#160;The LOI should state which priority area (s) they will be applying for.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;I found out about The National Collaboration to Promote Health, Wellness, and Academic Success of School-Age Children (CDC-RFA-DP16-1601) through a partner. Have been looking through the website to find out more. I have one question. Our business partner mentioned a letter of intent submission date by Dec 15th, however, I can't find that date on your website. Just want to see if the information provided by our partner is correct and where should we send the letter of intent.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;To access the full announcement, please go to www.grants.gov. (http://www.grants.gov/view-opportunity.html?oppId=280120)</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> &#160;Do mental and behavioral health services fall within the scope of this initiative?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;Applicants must demonstrate the ability to execute the CDC strategies and activities and meet project outcomes as outlined in the FOA. The five priority areas in this FOA are: (1) Physical Education and Physical Activity, (2) School Nutrition Environment and Services, (3) Out of School Time Healthy Eating and Physical Activity, (4) School Health Services for Managing Chronic Conditions, and (5) School Health Services for Promoting Sexual Health.</p>

<p><strong>Question: </strong>&#160;Is there still an opportunity to apply even though we did not submit an LOI? &#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer: </strong>&#160;LOI’s are due December 15th. &#160;The LOI is optional, and not required for application.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; I’m having trouble figuring out how the amount CDC has made available for Funding Opportunity Number CDC-RFA-DP16-1601 is determined. I cannot find any appropriations for PHS Act Section 317(k)(2), which the full announcement identifies as the statutory authority<strong>.</strong></p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; The Public Health Service Act section 317(k)(2) is the statutory authority, but funding for the program comes from the annual appropriation allotted by Congress to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for school health.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Is there more background you can give on this funding in terms of your vision for the connection with coordinated school health?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; All proposed activities should be developed and delivered within the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child Framework (http://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/wscc ).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Would grantees be working nationally, ideally?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We would like to know if there will be other similar opportunities, as we will likely miss the January 16th deadline.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This will be the only funding opportunity announcement available.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; While we recognize that&#160;this mechanism is designed to address the three categories as outlined by the FOA synopsis: professional development and technical assistance, education and dissemination, and internal and coordination activities, can this application also include research?&#160;Specifically, can it be used to examine the efficacy of a wellness&#160;program before and after its introduction?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; No. Awardees may not use funds for research. &#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; When we looked at the synopsis of the application on grants.gov, we noticed that there are only 5 awards for $300k, totaling $2.25 million. &#160;However, when we downloaded the complete document from grants.gov), we saw that the yearly value was for&#160;5 awards for $375k/year, totaling $11.25 million. Are there different mechanisms of grant applications&#160;within the same opportunity?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; These are approximate funding amounts.&#160;There is a floor and ceiling to the funding amounts.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We currently have a state initiative that is looking to increase awareness with nutrition education and to strengthen school physical activity and physical education programs.&#160;Please feel free to send me more information to relay to the Department of Health and our inner office at the Department of Education.&#160; Thanks for your time. &#160;</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We are interested in the National Collaboration to Promote Health, Wellness, and Academic Success of School-Age Children grant with the priority of sexual health education but since the award numbers are one per priority, I wanted to see if charter schools have been funded in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Would you be so kind as to let me know if a project I am working on fits with the mission of the National Collaboration to Support Health, Wellness and Academic Success of School-Age Children grant?&#160; A group of educators, health professionals, coaches and students are trying to invigorate the Track and Field program at the high school.&#160; We plan on embedding the new track into the surrounding woods much like the unique track at the Nike Headquarters in Oregon.&#160;We have already garnered about $30,000 in local support and are now pursuing the lion’s share of the estimated $400,000 total cost through grants.&#160;Please be so kind as to let me know if your program fits.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This FOA is intended to fund non-governmental organizations to establish and maintain policy, systems and environmental change strategies across the country to achieve desired outcomes. This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth. Applicants must address the organizational capacity requirements, including that the applicant is a national NGO which can identify representative constituencies (e.g., members, networks, affiliates, or chapters) within twenty-five or more states.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We are currently seeking funding support to address the chronic violence plaguing our schools.&#160; We are a prevention and implementing NGO aimed at designing peer-to-peer mediation programs in primary and secondary schools with high incident rates of violence throughout Southern Africa. The Health, Wellness and Academic Success of School-age Children funding opportunity recently submitted does not make note of international applicants.&#160; Can you clarify this point?&#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This announcement is only for non-research domestic activities supported by CDC.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We would like to know if Puerto Rico has an opportunity to participant in this grant. We are a nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) status in Puerto Rico. We are a strong community coalition to promote prevention in our community.&#160;We believe if we have a school-based program focused on teaching our kids and adolescents&#160;the importance of health, wellness and&#160;prevention, they will be healthy adults. If Puerto Rico has an opportunity to summit this grant we will start to work on our proposal.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This FOA is intended to fund non-governmental organizations to establish and maintain policy, systems and environmental change strategies across the country to achieve desired outcomes. This FOA supports nationwide implementation of cross-cutting approaches to promote school health and prevent and control chronic diseases and their risk factors among youth.

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We are a Ugandan community based organization (CBO) dedicated to children’s well-being by providing education, health care and support to economic empowerment of families to see that children get the basic requirements. I am kindly seeking your guidance on eligibility to apply for funding for open opportunities.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This announcement is only for non-research domestic activities supported by CDC.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; We noticed that the average award is suggested to be $375,000, but the annual award is $2,250,000 for five awards, or $450,000 each ($375,000 is one sixth of that amount).&#160; Is there a chance of 6 awards instead of 5?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; We will not be able to determine the number of awards until the panels are complete. There is a floor of $300,000 with a ceiling of $600,000.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Will CDC be assigning 1601 awardees target states to work in, or do 1601 awardees have discretion to select target states? &#160;If so, should we commit to states in our proposal and work plan?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; 1601 awardees and CDC will work together to determine target states.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; The FOA asks applicants to “[propose] staffing for at least one full-time employee” – can you clarify this requirement?&#160;</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; One full time employee is one person dedicated 100% time to the project.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; You get 25 pages for a “multi-component” FOA.&#160; Is this a multi-component FOA?&#160; I understand applicants applying for multiple priority areas should submit separate program narrative sections.&#160; Do we get 20 or 25 pages?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; This is not a multi-component FOA.&#160;The page limit is 20 pages.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Awardee Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan: This report is due 6 months into the award.&#160;Yet the evaluation and performance measure plan is required as part of the application package and is worth 25 points.&#160;Should we write this plan as if it was the final plan, or is there a specific point where we need to include TBD collaboration and CDC guidance in our proposed evaluation plan?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; Yes, the plan should be written as if it were final.&#160; We ask applicants to fill this out so that reviewers can understand how the applicant will evaluate the achievement of program goals, strategies, and activities. CDC staff will work with awardees on evaluation plans post award.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:&#160; Awardee Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan:&#160;This report requests awardees to demonstrate improved public health outcomes, but the logic model focuses on policy and practice change, even in the long-term outcomes.&#160;Should our proposal also include an evaluation plan that collects public health outcomes data?</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><strong>Answer</strong>:&#160; The evaluation plan should include specific information about how the performance measures and other programmatic activities will be assessed/evaluated. If applicable, your proposal may include both public health outcomes as well as policy and practice change.</p>
