<h4>April 2013</h4>

<h4>NIOSH and Signal Peak Energy Renew Partnership</h4>

<p>Recently, NIOSH and Signal Peak Energy (SPE) renewed their partnership, extending their agreement to September 2016. This new agreement extends collaborative efforts between SPE and NIOSH that are related to demonstration of instrumentation and tools for mine ventilation design and job hazard management. The gas analysis information obtained from this joint effort has safety benefits to both SPE and the broader underground coal mining community. For more information contact Robert Krog at <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1" style=" white-space: nowrap;">(412) 386-6729</span> or <a href="mailto:RKrog@cdc.gov">RKrog@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

<h4>March 2013</h4>

<h4>New Partnership with the French National Research and Safety Institute</h4>

<p>Dr. John Howard, director of NIOSH, and Dr. Stéphane Pimbert, director of INRS, the French National Research and Safety Institute for the Prevention of Occupational Accidents and Diseases (Institut national de recherche ed de sécurité) have signed a partnership agreement committing to cooperate in sharing knowledge and preventive measures to improve worker safety and health. An initial activity will be the keynote presentation by Dr. Jean Meade, NIOSH medical officer, entitled “Understanding Cutaneous Occupational Allergy: A Necessary Step for Prevention” at the INRS April 2013 Conference on Occupational Allergies in Nancy, France. See <span class="cdc-decorated"><a href="http://en.inrs.fr/">http://en.inrs.fr/</a></span> for additional information about INRS.</p>

<p><strong>Ergonomic Patent for a Wearable Kneel-Sit Support Device</strong><br />
On December 26, 2006, three NIOSH employees received U.S. Patent Number 7,152,919 for the “Wearable Kneel-Sit Support Device.” Developed by Steve Wurzelbacher (former employee), Ova Johnston (deceased), and Steve Hudock, the device is a product of research on ergonomic interventions in the shipbuilding and repair industries. Researchers observed that many shipyard employees spent a large percentage of time in kneeling to perform cutting, grinding, or welding tasks at floor or deck level. Also, an uncharacteristically high rate of lower extremity injuries and disorders was noted. This device is worn on the lower calf just above the worker’s boot and, when kneeling, the worker can deploy the device to create a support for the back of the thighs. Sitting back on the support results in less <a href="archive.html#y">hyperflexion</a> of the knee than without the device.

<p><strong>NIOSH Safety Engineer Awarded for Investigation of Oxygen Regulator Fires</strong><br />
Tim Merinar, Safety Engineer in the NIOSH Division of Safety Research, was recognized by the Virginia Beach VA, Fire Department for meritorious service to the department. In February 2005, the Fire Department experienced a near-miss incident in which a device on an oxygen tank, an oxygen resuscitator regulator, spontaneously ignited and burned. As a result of a request to NIOSH from the Fire Department for technical assistance in determining the cause of the ignition, Mr. Merinar coordinated an investigation and worked with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a forensic evaluator to identify likely cause. From the findings, he further coordinated a joint FDA and NIOSH Public Health Notification that rapidly alerted fire departments, emergency responder agencies, and healthcare services across the U.S. to the potential hazard, and provided guidance on avoiding it. Presenting Mr. Merinar with an inscribed, bronze, presentation fire-axe, the Fire Department said that the response to its request exemplifies how the government and the private sector should work hand-in-hand. The joint FDA and NIOSH Public Health Notification can be found at <span class="cdc-decorated"><a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/042406-o2fires.html">http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety/042406-o2fires.html</a><a href="../../Other/disclaimer.html" target="_blank"><img title="External Web Site Icon" class="externalImg" alt="External Web Site Icon" src="http://www.cdc.gov/TemplatePackage/images/icon_out.png" /></a></span>.

<h4>December 2005</h4>

<p>NIOSH conducts research to prevent illness and injury among workers. Good stewardship requires research we conduct to be highly relevant, high quality, and result in maximum impact. As a means of focusing our research on these drivers, NIOSH research now follows a process called Research-to-Practice (r2p). Conducting research under r2p utilizes partnerships to help address relevance and evaluation to help ensure quality. Partnerships are utilized in all phases of the research process (frequently with different partners in the different phases) for several reasons: ensuring relevant issues are being addressed; identifying all appropriate stakeholders; and translating results into a format that is most useful for stakeholders. The number of formal partnerships with NIOSH has doubled during the last year. Evaluation – again in all phases of the research process – is used to ensure that the highest quality research is being planned, conducted, translated and disseminated to stakeholders. The following link provides more information on r2p at NIOSH, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/r2p">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/r2p</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Instrument for Prevention of Vibration Disorders</strong><br />
It was originally developed to advance NIOSH research on preventing pain, numbness, and other work-related conditions of the hands and arms that are associated with vibration. Now it has additional prospects in the commercial market, with the same ultimate goal of reducing impairment among people who use powered hand tools for a living.</p>

<p>“It” is the 3-Axis Hand-Transmitted Vibration Simulator, which was developed through collaboration between NIOSH and MB Dynamics, Cleveland, Ohio. The device is an instrument handle that reproduces the vibration from power tools. NIOSH provided the specifications, looking for a device that could reproduce vibration from many directions, or axes, as the handles of actual power tools do. A public advertisement of their request yielded a number of proposals, and after an extensive review process, the NIOSH research team settled on MB Dynamics design. MB Dynamics, working through the awarded purchase order from NIOSH, turned the specifications into a working device. NIOSH uses the device to gain better insight into the factors that link occupational exposures to vibration with given physiological outcomes. MB Dynamics plans to market a commercial version of the device at conferences to researchers in both the academic and government worlds who are studying hand-transmitted vibration exposure and to companies interested in testing the components and assemblies that may be used on cars, trucks, and airplanes. Mention of a commercial product does not represent a NIOSH endorsement of the commercial product. More information on the NIOSH research program for preventing vibration-related hand-arm vibration disorders is available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/97-141/ergotxt5c.html">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/97-141/ergotxt5c.html</a>.</p>

<h4>September 2005</h4>

<p>An article appearing in the August issue of <em>Professional Roofing</em> magazine demonstrates how NIOSH investigations prompted quick actions to decrease potential exposures of roofers to silica dust. The actions came after NIOSH conducted a series of Health Hazard Evaluations (HHEs) in 2003 and 2004 in Phoenix, AZ to examine exposures of roofing contractor employees to silica dust while dry-cutting cement tiles. NIOSH subsequently established a screening program to identify potential indications of silicosis. NIOSH, along with representatives from government, professional organizations, industry and worker groups, gathered to strategize ways of discuss the problem and form a working group to identify work practices to decrease exposures among these workers.

<p><strong>r2p Focus of NORA Conference on Musculoskeletal Disorder Risk</strong><br />
The National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD) Team is co-sponsoring a working research conference titled "The Changing Nature of Musculoskeletal Disorder Risk: The Effects of Obesity and Aging in the American Workplace," to be held on September 7-8, 2005, in Seattle, Washington. Fundamental population changes in age and obesity will affect the design of work, workstations, and products. This workshop will build on existing MSD research which included age and body mass index in statistical models. Speakers will present the magnitude and complexity of these issues and their implications for MSD in the workplace. After initial presentations, the conference participants will work on a research agenda necessary to translate research findings to changing practices in the workplace. The objective of the conference is to develop a research to practice roadmap for addressing the changing nature of MSD risk in the workplace. Attendees are expected to include musculoskeletal researchers, policy makers, and occupational safety, health and ergonomics managers.

<p><strong>NIOSH Grantee Designs Ergonomic Interventions for the Fire Service</strong><br />
With NIOSH grant funding, researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) are designing and evaluating ergonomic interventions that have the potential to reduce the high number of musculoskeletal injuries experienced by firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) during emergency medical service (EMS) operations. Karen Conrad, Paul Reichelt, and Steve Lavender designed their research to have a very high level of participation with the fire service.</p>

<p>The UIC team began their project by conducting multiple rounds of focus groups with fire service personnel to generate ergonomic intervention concepts to improve the conduct of frequently performed and strenuous EMS tasks. Working with the fire service, the most highly ranked of these intervention ideas were then turned into alpha prototypes of devices. The devices were tested in their ergonomics laboratory by having firefighters and paramedics perform common patient handling tasks (e.g., carrying a patient down a flight of stairs) using the new devices and their standard equipment.</p>

<p>Using both the biomechanical data and evaluative feedback from the fire service personnel about the performance of the alpha prototypes, the researchers are now preparing to collect further evaluative data to facilitate the development of beta prototypes that can serve as manufacturing models. The university team will continue to work with the fire service to develop effective strategies for dissemination and implementation of the devices.</p>

<p>Agriculture is one of the most hazardous industries in Minnesota and the United States. In rural Minnesota, adolescents are frequently employed in both agricultural and non-agricultural jobs and are injured at a higher rate than older workers. Recently, with support from NIOSH the Minnesota Department of Health evaluated the effectiveness of a pilot occupational safety and health curriculum for adolescents in rural Minnesota high schools. <em>Work Safe Work Smart</em> contains nine lessons to enhance knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to occupational safety and health. Evaluation measured changes in attitudes and beliefs related to prevention, identified critical factors for incorporating the curriculum into existing school curricula, and promoted dissemination and utilization of the curriculum in rural schools.</p>

<p>Allan Williams, Principal Investigator, reported that “adolescents exposed to the curriculum demonstrated measurable changes in several outcomes that may be associated with beneficial behaviors in occupational safety and health. The measured changes in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs were largely limited to the same school year in which the curriculum was taught, suggesting that adolescents may need to be exposed to concepts of occupational safety and health on an ongoing or repetitive basis.”</p>

<p>Following completion of the evaluation, over 4,000 copies of the curriculum were requested on CD-ROM, and the curriculum was downloaded over 11,000 times from the Health Department Web site. The <em>Work Safe Work Smart</em> curriculum is available at <a href="http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/hpcd/cdee/occhealth/wsws.html">http://www.health.state.mn.us/divs/hpcd/cdee/occhealth/wsws.html</a>.

<p><strong>National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory (NPPTL)</strong><br />
As mentioned in the “r2p Corner” of the February edition of NIOSH <em>eNews</em>, Breakthrough, a CD-ROM based computer model, assists users of air-purifying respirators with predicting the “end of service life” for respirator cartridges designed to protect against toxic organic vapors. Recognizing its importance, Roy McKay of the Department of Environmental Health, College of Medicine at the University of Cincinnati has incorporated the software into the curriculum for a graduate course on Respiratory Protection. Through this course, Dr. McKay assists students with developing methods for cartridge change out schedules. This product is one of 20 methods used. In addition, Dr. McKay utilizes the software during a day and a half continuing education workshop on Respiratory Protection.</p>

<h4>February 2005</h4>

<p>Customer use highlights the successful implmentation of a NOSH research product. The product is a CD-ROM-based computer model developed by NIOSH and collaborating organizations, in conjunction with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, to help users of air-purifying respirators predict the “end of service life” (ESL) for respirator cartridges designed to protect against toxic organic vapors. ESL is the juncture at which time a toxic vapor will begin to penetrate a given filter, due to normal degradation of the filter over time. OSHA, beginning in 1998, has required employers to use ESL indicator devices that will alert users to replace cartridges in time to prevent toxic exposures from occurring. Such devices are unavailable for organic-vapor cartridges, necessitating the use of a predictive computer model as the next best thing.</p>

<p>Although ESL models for organic-vapor cartridges have been developed, they lacked an important feature that the NIOSH model provides. This is the incorporation of relative humidity into the various workplace factors (such as temperature, pace of work, and contaminant levels) that affect the integrity and performance of the filter. Humidity is a key factor, since it can reduce service life by 80 percent. In the 12 months since the program was made available in software form and uploaded to OSHA’s Web site as a compliance assistance tool (along with a user-friendly video tutorial):</p>

<li>It has been downloaded from the OSHA Web site more than 1,700 times. <a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/respiratory/advisor_genius_wood/breakthrough.html">http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/respiratory/advisor_genius_wood/breakthrough.html</a>.</li>

<li>There have been more than 3,000 visits to the OSHA Web site to view the video or to ask questions about the model.</li>

<p><strong>Mine Rescue and Response - Technologies</strong><br />
U.S. miners often rely on emergency responders to save their lives in the event of an underground emergency, such as a fire, explosion, roof fall, or water inundation. Approximately 700 underground coal mines and 240 underground metal/nonmetal and stone mines continue to operate in the U.S. They employ a total workforce of 40,000 coal miners, and 14,000 metal/nonmetal/stone miners. Additionally, there are 4,700 underground contractors that are employed by these mines. A recent survey conducted by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) indicated that there are 236 state and company mine rescue teams in the U.S.; 120 coal mine teams and 116 metal &#38; nonmetal mine rescue teams with a total of about 1,700 rescue team members. This dedicated group of miners often put their lives in jeopardy to save others during a mine emergency. It is important that team members are provided with the latest personal protective equipment, be well trained, physically fit, and fully understand the hazards that may await them during rescue, exploration and recovery operations. Miners are often the first responders to a mine emergency, such as a fire, and must decide if they can fight the fire or evacuate the mine. Miners also need realistic training and adequate technology to safely and effectively conduct such operations.</p>

<p>Improved technologies for mine emergency responders are also being identified and evaluated. The technologies include chemical lightshapes, light vests, strobe lights, laser pointers, lifelines, wheeled stretchers, and thermal imaging cameras. These devices were shown to enhance the effectiveness and safety of mine rescue teams and evacuating miners in dark and smoke-filled passageways during realistic rescue and evacuation simulations at the NIOSH Lake Lynn Laboratory Mine and operating mines. Several mine rescue teams and coal mine operators have adopted the technologies.</p>

<p>Technology to enhance communications during mine emergencies has also been developed. When a rescue team explores complex underground passageways such as found in mines, a lifeline and reliable communication system are essential. Previous communication technology was based on a sound powered phone system that provided communication from only one team member to one other location, the underground fresh air base. Communication between team members required shouting through the breathing apparatus face pieces. NIOSH and Transtek, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA, collaborated in the development and evaluation of the Ron Conti Res-Q-Com System. This system is named after Ron S. Conti (deceased) to pay tribute to the NIOSH researcher who led its development. The Res-Q-Com is a self-contained, portable battery operated system that provides voice communication and a lifeline for rescue teams, such as those called out for an underground mine emergency. It is now commercially available.</p>

<p>These technologies have also been highlighted in the September 8 and September 15, 2003 issues of <em>International Longwall News</em>. The Res-Q-Com system was highlighted in the December 19, 2003 issue of <em>International Longwall News</em>.

<h4>December 2004</h4>

<p>NIOSH and Brush Wellman Inc., the leading U.S. producer of beryllium and beryllium-containing products, have partnered in an effort to prevent chronic beryllium disease. This partnership encompasses a variety of projects, including workplace medical surveillance studies, alternative exposure metrics for exposure assessment, physicochemical characterization of beryllium process samples, the study of the possible role of dermal exposure in the development of the immune response to beryllium, and exposure reduction through workplace interventions. Employees are an integral part of this partnership. In addition to helping implement changes that reduce exposures, partnership interactions have helped workers and management to be more cognizant of potential exposures and help identify additional ways to reduce these exposures. Brush Wellman, as part of their product stewardship program, also passes information on control strategies to their customers, further enhancing workplace disease prevention. Many of these lessons will also be shared at a conference that NIOSH is co-sponsoring, the International Beryllium Research Conference (Be2005), to be held on March 8-11, 2005. More information on the conference can be found at <a href="http://www.irsst.qc.ca/en/intro-be-2005.html">http://www.irsst.qc.ca/en/intro-be-2005.html</a></p>

<h4>November 2004</h4>

<p><strong>NIOSH and EPA Partner to Reduce Work-Induced Hearing Loss</strong><br />
As a result of work conducted by NIOSH and industry partners, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to revise its regulation on hearing protector labeling. A public meeting was held in 2003 where NIOSH provided technical expertise. Since the original rule in 1978, the development of miniaturized electronics and new acoustic technologies has created several additional classes of hearing protectors not covered in the existing regulation. Among these are communication headsets, active noise reduction headsets, sound restoration hearing protectors, and nonlinear acoustic devices. NIOSH’s active research program has assisted in the development of specialized test methods to assess the attenuation performance of these newer protectors. EPA proposes to use those methods in its revised regulation. More information on NIOSH’s participation can be obtained from Bill Murphy at <a href="mailto:WMurphy@cdc.gov">WMurphy@cdc.gov</a>. More information on NIOSH hearing loss prevention activities can be found at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Training for Healthcare Workers on the Dangers of Bloodborne Pathogens</strong><br />
With funding from NIOSH, researchers at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health have developed a Web-based innovative learning program for healthcare workers about bloodborne pathogens. This simulation-training program is based on the premise that adults learn best when they actively participate in the learning process. Participants have an opportunity to read a simulated story based on a true event, make decisions, and come to conclusions on their own. Nurses who complete the training will receive up to three continuing education credits. For more information, visit the Bloodborne Pathogen Training for Nurses Web site at <a href="http://www.bbp-nursetraining.hs.columbia.edu/">http://www.bbp-nursetraining.hs.columbia.edu/</a>.</p>

<h4>October 2004</h4>

<p>NIOSH is working with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to address potential occupational health concerns of employees who operate baggage screening x-ray machines at airports. NIOSH is assessing employees’ work practices, characterizing potential employee exposure to x-rays from screening machines, and providing recommendations for TSA and their employees. Since this study involves workers at several airports and is conducted across seasonal changes, providing the latest study findings to everyone is essential. Using the r2p approach, NIOSH developed a web site, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/airportscreener">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/airportscreener</a>, to provide workers with effective techniques for reducing potential exposure and TSA with preliminary research findings and recommendations so that measures can be taken immediately.

<p><strong>Software for Ground Control in Mine Design</strong><br />
From its research on ground control, NIOSH has developed a number of software packages to help mine planners, managers, and others in designing mines and troubleshooting problems to prevent roof falls that may result in death or serious injury to miners. The software packages include programs on “Analysis of Longwall Pillar Stability,” “Analysis of Retreat Mining Pillar Stability,” “Analysis of Horizontal Stress Effects in Mining,” “LAMODEL” for calculating stresses and displacements in thin seams or veins, “Analysis of Roof Bolt Systems,” Coal Mine Roof Rating,” and “Troubleshooting Guide for Roof Support Systems.” Users have hailed the programs as “very useful” and a “type of help [that] keeps us safer and more productive.” These software packages can be accessed at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/topics/groundcontrol/">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/topics/groundcontrol/</a>. Further information is available from Christopher Mark, NIOSH Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, at <a href="mailto:CMark@cdc.gov">CMark@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

<h4>April 2004</h4>

<p>Research to Practice (r2p) is a new NIOSH initiative focused on the transfer and translation of research findings, technologies, and information into highly effective prevention services and products which are adopted in the workplace. The goal of <em><strong>r2p</strong></em> is to reduce illness and injury by increasing workplace use of effective NIOSH and NIOSH-funded research findings. In order to achieve this, NIOSH is continuing to work with our partners to focus our research on ways to develop effective products, to translate research findings into practice, to target dissemination efforts, and to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of these efforts in improving worker health and safety.</p>

<p>Several recent NIOSH successes exemplify the types of activities the new r2p initiative is designed to promote and enhance:</p>

<ul>
<li>In collaboration with manufacturers, labor and industry, NIOSH developed a new personal dust monitor (PDM) for assessing coal miners’ exposure to coal dust in underground coal mines. The first advancement in more than 30 years for monitoring exposures, the PDM provides real-time exposure data during a work shift. It warns of potential over-exposures in time for mine operators to reduce exposures that might lead over time to development of coal workers’ pneumoconiosis or “black lung,” a debilitating lung disease that caused 14,000 deaths between 1991 and 2000. NIOSH plans to conduct additional testing this year to verify its performance in a mine environment in collaboration with mine operators, miners, MSHA and the device developer Rupprecht &#38; Patashnick Co., Inc. NIOSH contact: Jon Volkwein <a href="mailto:JVolkwein@cdc.gov">JVolkwein@cdc.gov</a>.</li>

<li>Through a simple color change, a NIOSH-developed hand wipe method quickly and easily detects the presence of lead on both the skin and on surfaces in industries where lead is produced or used. This alert enables employers to take timely action to reduce lead exposures in the workplace and to prevent the risk of an employee inadvertently contaminating his or her home with lead dust on clothing, skin, or hair. Through this novel technology, lead exposure can be reduced for more than 10,000 workers and 900,000 children in the United States. NIOSH has patented, commercially licensed, and disseminated information on this method. NIOSH contact: Eric Esswein at <a href="mailto:eesswein@cdc.gov">eesswein@cdc.gov</a>.</li>

<li>NIOSH developed an innovation that provides the basis for a new, commercially available do-it-yourself kit to detect the mold <em>Stachybotrys chartarum</em>. <em>S. chartarum </em>is a toxigenic mold commonly found in chronically water-damaged buildings. Determining if a building is contaminated with <em>S. chartarum</em> has been difficult due to the lack of a good detection device. The NIOSH-developed innovation is a species-specific monoclonal antibody that is being used as a diagnostic reagent in this novel technology kit. This kit provides building inspectors, industrial hygienists and homeowners with a simple tool to detect the mold in less than 5 minutes. NIOSH contact: Detlef Schmechel at <a href="mailto:zvf9@cdc.gov">zvf9@cdc.gov</a>.</li>

<li>In partnership with an engineering firm, NIOSH in 2003 helped to produce a detailed, easy-to-read booklet recommending and describing engineering measures on commercial crab fishing vessels to prevent injuries in this highly hazardous industry. More than 3,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed in the U.S. and abroad. The recommendations in the booklet resulted from NIOSH’s partnerships with many stakeholders to develop practical interventions that address hazards posed by machinery, fishing equipment, and physical design and layout of fishing vessels. NIOSH contact: Brad Husberg at <a href="mailto:bjh9@cdc.gov">bjh9@cdc.gov</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Historically, NIOSH has been a leader in applying research into workplace solutions that reduce injury and illness. Now, as our mission grows increasingly complex and intensive, we are challenged to work more efficiently and effectively with our partners, to apply r2p practices at every turn, and to evaluate their effectiveness so that our best practices keep getting more focused to serve the needs of our customers.
