<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="sec" name="sec" title="Special Exposure Cohort"> </a>Special Exposure Cohort Petition Information</h3>

<p>The Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) is a unique category of employees established by the Act (<a href="ocaseeoi.html#items">42 CFR Part 83</a>). Claims compensated under the SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction process. To qualify for compensation under the SEC, a covered employee must meet specific requirements (e.g., must have at least one of 22 "<a href="ocassec.html#cancers">specified cancers</a>," and have worked for a specified time period at one of the SEC sites). Classes of employees and work sites can be considered for addition to the SEC through a NIOSH petition process. More information about the Special Exposure Cohort can be found on our <a href="faqssec.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>

<h4>SEC Petitions Not Qualifying for Evaluation</h4>

<p>In addition to the petitions listed above, five petitions were received but did not qualify for evaluation. Four petitions did not meet the minimum petition requirements and the class defined in the other petition was already included in the SEC.</p>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="woact" name="woact" title="Worker Outreach Activities"> </a>Worker Outreach Activities</h3>

<p>Based on a recommendation from the <a href="ocasadv.html">Advisory Board</a> to provide workers and site experts with opportunities to participate in developing the technical documents used in dose reconstruction, NIOSH established a Worker Outreach Program.</p>

<p>At Worker Outreach Meetings, current and former DOE and AWE employees have opportunities to obtain information about Site Profiles, Technical Basis Documents, and Technical Information Bulletins, and to provide information for consideration and possible use in dose reconstruction. This process is valuable to ensure that the technical documents used in dose reconstruction contain correct and useful information.</p>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="peppers" name="peppers" title="Program Evaluation Plans and Reports (PEPs and PERs)"> </a>Program Evaluation Reports (PERs) and Program Evaluation Plans (PEPs)</h3>

<p>NIOSH is committed to applying the best available science in dose reconstructions. In keeping with this commitment, completed cases with probabilities of causation less than 50% are reviewed as relevant new information becomes available. The results of these reviews are described in a Program Evaluation Report (PER). The PER details the effect, if any, of the new information on the completed dose reconstruction. If it appears that the new information may result in an increase in dose for a completed dose reconstruction with a probability of causation of less than 50%, NIOSH is committed to working with the Department of Labor to reopen and rework the dose reconstruction, as appropriate. A Program Evaluation Plan (PEP) describes plans for evaluating specific program details or issues.</p>

<p><strong>Approved:</strong> December 18, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the effect of revising the Y-12 Plant TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There were 693 Y-12 claims completed prior to January 12, 2006, with a probability of causation below 50%. The dose reconstruction methodology of each will be reviewed to determine if a new dose reconstruction is necessary to determine if the revisions increase the dose estimate. NIOSH will review these dose reconstructions to determine if they meet the criterion listed in this PER. NIOSH will provide DOL with the list of 693 claims as well as a determination on each claim as to whether a new dose estimate is required. Documentation for each claim not requiring a new dose reconstruction will provide the basis for that determination.</p>
