<p>The Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) is a uniquely defined category of employees established under <a href="ocaseeoi.html">The Act</a>. The SEC is comprised of classes of employees who:</p>

<ul>
<li>have at least one of the 22 <a href="faqssec.html#cancers">SEC cancers</a> and</li>

<li>have worked for a specific period of time at one of the <a href="ocassec.html#classes">SEC Work Sites</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Claims compensated under the SEC do not have to go through the dose reconstruction process, as is required for other cancer claims covered by The Act.</p>

<p>The Act also allows for additional groups of employees (called classes of employees) to be added to the SEC. Classes of employees and work sites can be considered for addition to the SEC through a <a href="how2add.html">petition process</a> run by NIOSH.</p>

								<h3>What is the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC)?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The SEC is a uniquely defined category of employees established under The Act (42 CFR Part 83). The SEC is comprised of classes of employees who have any of 22 &quot;<a href="faqssec.html#cancers">specified cancers</a>,&quot; who worked for a specified period of time at one of the <a href="ocassec.html#classes">SEC Work Sites</a> or participated in certain nuclear weapons tests, and who meet other additional requirements under The Act. An individual member (or the eligible survivors of a member) of a class of employees included in the SEC is entitled to compensation without having to undergo a dose reconstruction performed for his or her case by NIOSH, or to have a decision by the Department of Labor (DOL) as to whether the cancer was &quot;at least as likely as not&quot; caused by occupational exposure to radiation, as is required for other cancer claims covered by The Act.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What is a &quot;class&quot; of employees?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>A class of employees is defined in the regulation as a group of employees who work or worked at the same Department of Energy (DOE) facility or Atomics Weapon Employer (AWE) facility, and for whom the availability of information and recorded data on radiation exposures is comparable with respect to the informational needs of dose reconstructions under the dose reconstruction regulation.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What are the 22 &quot;specified cancers&quot; for compensation for the SEC? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>In addition to being a member of one of the classes of employees included in the SEC, to qualify for compensation, a covered employee must also have at least one of the following types of cancer:</p><ul><li>Bone cancer</li><li>Renal cancers</li><li>Leukemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia) provided the onset of the disease was at least two years after first exposure</li><li>Lung cancer (other than in-situ lung cancer that is discovered during or after a post-mortem exam)</li></ul><p>The following diseases provided onset was at least five years after first exposure:<br />&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Multiple myeloma</li><li>Lymphomas (other than Hodgkin&#39;s disease)</li><li>Primary cancer of the:<br /><ul><li>Bile ducts</li><li>Brain</li><li>Breast (female or male)</li><li>Colon</li><li>Esophagus</li><li>Gall bladder</li><li>Liver (except if cirrhosis or hepatitis B is indicated)</li><li>Ovary</li><li>Pancreas</li><li>Pharynx</li><li>Salivary gland</li><li>Small intestine</li><li>Stomach</li><li>Thyroid</li><li>Urinary bladder</li></ul></li></ul>

									<h3>Where did the list of 22 &quot;specified cancers&quot; for the SEC come from? Did NIOSH develop this list?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Neither NIOSH nor the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health developed the list of 22 "specified cancers," and neither can modify the list. The list is part of the EEOICPA statute, and only Congress can modify the list of "specified cancers." The origin for the list of "specified cancers" began in the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act (REVCA) of 1988. The Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act's original list included 13 cancers that were based on published reports from National Research Council Committees that identified elevated risks of contracting these cancers after exposure to radiation. This list of 13 cancers was then incorporated into the original enactment of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990. In 2000, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act was amended to incorporate a variety of changes, including the addition of 6 more specified cancers. The list of "specified cancers" for inclusion in the SEC is comprised of 22 cancers: 19 cancers specified in RECA; renal and bone cancers as specified in EEOICPA; and male and female breast cancers, which are considered separately under EEOICPA.</p>

<p>The following table shows a comparison of the "specified cancers" under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, the Radiation-Exposed Veterans Compensation Act, and EEOICPA.</p>

									<h3>Which classes of employees are currently included in the SEC?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>A list of the classes of employees that are currently included in the SEC can be found on the <a href="ocassec.html">Special Exposure Cohort</a> page under <a href="ocassec.html#classes">Classes of Employees Currently Included in the SEC</a>.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Does everyone who falls under the class definition get paid?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>No, in order to be eligible for compensation, an individual must also have at least 250 aggregated days of employment in a class or classes in the SEC and one of the 22 SEC <a href="faqssec.html#cancers">&quot;specified cancers.&quot;</a></p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What does &quot;aggregated&quot; days of employment mean?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Aggregated days of employment are the total number of days that a worker was employed in a class at multiple covered SEC facilities. The total number of days of employment in a class at each facility can be combined together to meet the 250 day requirement.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Where did this 250 day requirement originate?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The 250 day requirement was written into the law by Congress when The Act was originally passed. There is no scientific basis for the 250 days. It is simply a work year.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Who is responsible for determining whether an employee worked the required 250 days at a site to be included in the SEC?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>DOL is responsible for making that determination.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Why does DOL determine eligibility for compensation?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Under The Act, DOL was designated the responsibility of determining the eligibility of energy employees with covered occupational illnesses and their survivors and managing claims for compensation and benefits.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Is the 250 day work requirement ever waived? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The SEC rule does provide for an alternative to the 250 work days employment requirement whenever classes of employees may have been exposed to radiation during discrete incidents likely to have involved exceptionally high-level exposures, including any such incidents that may have occurred during projects of short duration. In this case, mere presence during the incident would substitute for the 250 work days employment requirement. It is important to note that in order to qualify an incident would have to be both high enough to be similar to a criticality and be one where NIOSH did not have the information needed to reconstruct dose with sufficient accuracy. Clean-up operations of highly radioactive materials would need to be evaluated based on the specific circumstances, such as the amount and type of exposures and the data that are available.</p>

									<h3>What happens if NIOSH uncovers new relevant information while conducting research for an SEC petition?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The evaluation of a qualified petition includes in-depth research on the available monitoring records and worker data to determine if NIOSH has the information needed to reconstruct radiation doses with sufficient accuracy and if it does not, whether the radiation doses may have endangered the health of the class of workers defined in the petition. In this process, we may uncover new information that confirms, refutes, or supplements the information in the petition and the existing information in NIOSH&#39;s database.</p><p>This new information may impact the SEC petition, and/or a related Site Profile or Technical Basis Document. With NIOSH&#39;s commitment and the requirement in the dose reconstruction rule to apply the best available science in dose reconstructions, when relevant information becomes available, we will revise technical documents and evaluate whether that new information will impact the compensability of a completed dose reconstruction with a probability of causation less than 50%.</p><p>A <a href="ocaspers.html">Program Evaluation Report (PER)</a>, details the effect, if any, of the new information on completed dose reconstructions. If it appears that the new information may result in an increase in dose for a completed dose reconstruction with a probability of causation of less than 50%, we are committed to working with DOL to reopen and rework the dose reconstruction, as appropriate.</p>

									<h3>Is NIOSH's evaluation of an SEC petition dependent on the status of a Site Profile or Technical Basis Document? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>NIOSH&#39;s evaluation of an SEC petition is not dependent on the status of a <a href="faqstd.html">Site Profile</a> or <a href="faqstd.html">Technical Basis Document</a>. Site Profiles provide tools and guidance for continuity in dose reconstructions for a facility; however, NIOSH does not necessarily require a Site Profile or Technical Basis Document to perform a dose reconstruction. The evaluation of a petition by the <a href="faqsar.html#abrwh">Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health</a> may be conducted at the same time as the Advisory Board&#39;s review of a Site Profile or Technical Basis Document. The information the Advisory Board decides to consider in its evaluation of an SEC petition is determined by the Advisory Board.</p>

		<div>			<h3>Petition is Denied (does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation)</h3>
		<a class="accordionTopAnchor"></a>
	<div id="GalleryAccordion_726916" class="accordion ">
								<h3>Why would HHS deny an SEC petition?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>If an SEC petition does not meet the minimum requirements set forth in the SEC petition procedures, NIOSH may determine that the petition does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation and may deny the SEC petition.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What happens if the Director of NIOSH determines that an SEC petition does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>If the SEC petition does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation, NIOSH will notify petitioners of any requirements that the petition failed to meet and provide guidance to the petitioners in developing the relevant information.</p><p>Petitioners have 30 calendar days from the date of notification to revise the petition. If, after 30 days, the petition remains unqualified, NIOSH will issue a decision that the petition does not qualify for evaluation. Petitioners then have 30 calendar days to request a review of that decision. If a review has been requested, NIOSH will make the final decision as to whether to accept or deny the petition based on results of the review. If at the end of the 30 calendar days the petition does not meet the minimum requirements or is not reviewed, NIOSH&#39;s proposed finding will become a final decision.</p>
	</div>

									<h3>What happens if the petitioner does not revise the petition in 30 days?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>After the 30 calendar days from the date of the initial notification, NIOSH will let the petitioners know that the petition still does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation.

									<h3>If the petition is denied because it does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation, can the petitioner request a review of that decision?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Yes, if the petition is denied because it does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation, the petitioner can request a review of that decision. The petitioners have 30 calendar days after notification that the petition remains unqualified to request the review, in writing, and must specify why the finding should be reversed.</p><p>The request may not include any new information or documentation that was not included in the original completed petition. If petitioners obtain new information within the allotted 30 day period, petitioners should provide the new information to NIOSH. NIOSH will consider this new information as a revision to the petition.</p>

		<div>

								<h3>What is an SEC Petition Evaluation Report?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The SEC rule requires that NIOSH evaluate all petitions that meet the minimum requirements to add a class of employees to the SEC. The evaluation is intended to provide a fair, science-based determination of whether it is feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation doses of the class of employees through NIOSH dose reconstructions. NIOSH documents its findings in an SEC Petition Evaluation Report.</p><p>An SEC Petition Evaluation Report typically contains the following:</p><ul><li>Petitioner Requested Class</li><li>Class Evaluated by NIOSH</li><li>NIOSH Proposed Class to be Added to the SEC</li><li>Feasibility of Dose Reconstruction</li><li>Health Endangerment Determination</li><li>Data Sources Reviewed by NIOSH to Evaluate the Class</li><li>Radiological Operations Relevant to the Class</li><li>Available Monitoring Data for the Class</li><li>Class Conclusion</li><li>References</li></ul>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What happens once the SEC Petition Evaluation Report is completed?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Once completed, the SEC Petition Evaluation Report is provided to the petitioner(s) and to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/faqsar.html#abrwh">Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health</a>. The evaluation will then be discussed by the Advisory Board, which provides advice to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on whether to add a class of employees to the SEC.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Are SC&amp;A's reviews of the SEC Petition Evaluation Report available to the petitioners and the public?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Yes, SC&#38;A's pre-decisional reports are provided to the petitioners, the public, and all pertinent Advisory Board Work Groups. The reports are also posted on our website on the <a href="ocasadv.html">Advisory Board</a> page, under the "Reports from the Technical Support Contractor" section, and the <a href="worksite.html">work site page</a> to which they apply. Copies of the report can also be obtained by contacting NIOSH directly at 513-533-6800 (toll-free at 1-877-222-7570) or by e-mail at <a href="mailto:dcas@cdc.gov">dcas@cdc.gov</a> or <a href="mailto:ocas@cdc.gov">ocas@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

		</div>
									<h3>Does Sanford, Cohen &amp; Associates (SC&amp;A), the Advisory Board's contractor, review each of the SEC Petition Evaluation Reports?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>No, the Advisory Board does not always task its technical contractor, <a href="faqsar.html#sca">SC&#38;A</a>, to review the report. The Advisory Board decides when to task its technical contractor to perform a review of an SEC Petition Evaluation Report, and on what areas the review will focus.</p>

		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The decision to accept or deny a petition because it does not meet the minimum requirements for review and evaluation becomes a final decision in 31 days if there is not a request by the petitioner to review the decision.</p>

									<h3>How long does NIOSH have to submit a recommendation on an SEC petition to the Advisory Board?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>NIOSH has 180 days to provide a recommendation to the Advisory Board regarding qualified SEC petitions.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>When does the 180 day time frame begin and end?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The 180 day time frame begins when NIOSH receives a petition and ends when NIOSH sends the SEC Petition Evaluation Report of that petition to the Advisory Board. This time does not include days when the petitioner is working on a response to a deficiency in the petition that affects the qualification of the petition or on clarification of information for qualifying the petition.</p>
	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Are there circumstances where NIOSH is unable to meet the 180-day time frame?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>NIOSH makes every effort to meet the 180-day deadline to provide an SEC Petition Evaluation Report to the petitioner and to the Advisory Board. However, there are circumstances where NIOSH is unable to meet the 180-day time frame. This is most often due to data capture problems, either where a facility is having difficulty locating or assembling the records requested, or where DOE does not have the resources available to process the data.</p><p>The evaluation of a qualified petition includes in-depth research on the available monitoring records and worker data to determine if NIOSH has the information needed to reconstruct radiation doses with sufficient accuracy, and if it does not, whether the radiation doses may have endangered the health of the class of workers defined in the petition. This in-depth research may take longer than 180 days.</p><p>When a petition covers a very broad time frame, it also can take additional time to evaluate the petition.</p><p>In addition, NIOSH&#39;s evaluation often goes well beyond the issues the petitioner identified in the petition. A petition might have identified a small number of issues to qualify, but NIOSH will review past Evaluation Reports, issues that are under review by the Advisory Board and its technical contractor, and any issues that might have arisen during NIOSH&#39;s site research and add those issues to the list to be researched during the evaluation process. This ensures that NIOSH has made a thorough investigation of potential reasons that it might not be able to complete dose reconstructions with sufficient accuracy and if the radiation doses may have endangered the health of the class of workers.</p>
