            					            					        							NIOSH is committed to applying the best available science in dose reconstructions. In keeping with this commitment, completed cases with probabilities of causation less than 50% are reviewed as relevant new information becomes available. The results of these reviews are described in a Program Evaluation Report (PER). The PER details the effect, if any, of the new information on the completed dose reconstruction. If it appears that the new information may result in an increase in dose for a completed dose reconstruction with a probability of causation of less than 50%, NIOSH is committed to working with the Department of Labor to reopen and rework the dose reconstruction, as appropriate. A Program Evaluation Plan (PEP) describes plans for evaluating specific program details or issues.<a id="pers2" name="pers">&#160;</a>

<p>September 8, 2003</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Describes the evaluation of the programmatic effect of the misinterpreted dosimetry records resulting in an underestimate of the missed dose for Savannah River Site dose reconstructions.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> While the underestimated missed dose resulted in a non-claimant favorable estimate of missed dose, the overestimated onsite ambient dose offset this underestimate. As a result, no further evaluation is necessary because the offset still resulted in a slight claimant favorable bias in the dose estimate and resulting probability of causation.</p>

<p>December 15, 2003</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Describes the evaluation of the programmatic effect of an error in surrogate organ assignment resulting in a potential underestimate of the X-ray dose for certain Savannah River Site dose reconstructions.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An error in surrogate organ assignment for the liver, gall bladder and spleen (ovaries was assigned instead of lung) resulted in the underestimation of X-ray organ doses in three completed dose reconstructions. The impact on the probability of causation in these three cases has been evaluated and found to be minimal (<u>&#60;</u>0.5%), and the probable compensability status of these claims was unaffected. No revision of any completed dose reconstructions is warranted; however, to preclude future occurrences of this error, revisions of several Technical Basis Documents has been initiated.</p>

<p>June 9, 2006</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Describes the evaluation of the programmatic effect of the misinterpreted application of the bias factor for Hanford Dose Reconstructions.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> An error in interpretation and application of the bias factor information in the Hanford External Dose Reconstruction Technical Basis Document (1) resulted in an underestimate of the external dose for certain Hanford claims. Claims that were potentially affected by this error were identified and those that had not already been submitted to the Department of Labor were returned to the ORAU team for rework. The cases that had been submitted to DOL were reevaluated by removing the bias factor, thus developing a revised external dose. The probability of causation for each of the affected claims was recalculated. This evaluation found that although this error appeared upon discovery to be rather significant, there was no impact on compensation decisions made by the Department of Labor.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Changes the external dosimetry target organ for prostate cancer from testes to urinary bladder. This change will result in lower organ doses and consequently, lower probability of causation values. Therefore, this change will not result in an increase in probability value for any completed claims, and no cases need to be re-evaluated.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Bethlehem Steel Technical Basis Document was revised on July 27, 2006. The revision changed the estimated quantity of uranium inhaled and ingested as well as external dose to the skin. As a result of revisions to the Bethlehem Steel Technical Basis Document, three claims that were previously determined to have a PC of less than 50% will now have a PC greater than 50%. Eight cases that previously had a PC greater than 50% now have a PC less than 50%. This report, along with detailed information on the specific cases and calculations, has been provided to DOL for determination of further action.</p>

<p>April 12, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to report the impact of the NIOSH-IREP lung cancer model on non-compensable cases completed before February 28, 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The "combined" lung cancer risk model was introduced on 02/28/06 via the release of NIOSH-IREP Version 5.5, followed by v5.5.1 on 05/16/06. The combined lung model is programmed with two different lung cancer risk models: the NIOSH-IREP model, plus an alternative risk model created by the National Cancer Institute for use in NIH-IREP, another version of IREP (referred to hereafter as the "NIH" model). For each cancer of the lung, trachea, or bronchus, NIOSH-IREP now calculates separately the probability of causation (PC) produced by each of the two risk models and reports the higher PC at the upper 99th percentile credibility limit as the PC value of record for the claim. NIOSH-IREP v5.5 and v5.5.1 also incorporate a bias correction factor for random errors in dosimetry for "never smokers" exposed to radon. Due to a programming oversight, this correction had been omitted for "never smokers" and was applied only to smokers in earlier versions of NIOSH-IREP. NIOSH-IREP v5.5 corrected this error.</p>

<p>This "combined" lung cancer risk model was endorsed by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, and can result in no lower PC value for the same set of claim inputs than had been calculated under previous versions of NIOSH-IREP (versions 5.4 and earlier).</p>

<p>For a more detailed description of the new combined model, including the background of and rationale for the modification, please refer to OCAS-PEP-008, dated 12/07/06.</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require a new dose reconstruction as a result of changes to the K-25 dose reconstruction methods.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There were 432 claims completed by NIOSH between 11/24/2004 and 8/31/2006 that resulted in a POC less than 50%. This does not include claims that may have been submitted in that time frame but subsequently returned to NIOSH for any reason. All these claims will be reviewed by NIOSH to determine if external co-worker data was used. NIOSH will request that DOL return those claims completed before 5/21/2005 determined to have been completed using external co-worker data. NIOSH will also request the return of those claims completed with external co-worker data between 5/21/2005 and 8/31/2006 if they are deemed a Construction Trades worker. DOL will be provided with documentation for the remaining claims indicating the claim did not meet these criteria.</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require revisions as a result of new dosimetry data at INL, ANL-E, and ANL-W.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Additional requests were sent in August/September 2006. By April of 2007 a response was received for each of the request. These requests resulted in receiving internal dose data for 83 claims, 62 from INL, 14 from ANL-W, 6 from ANL-E and one with additional records from both INL and ANL-W.</p>

<p>Some of these claims have already been returned to NIOSH for new dose reconstruction for various reasons. The new dose reconstructions will consider the new data received. NIOSH is requesting the remaining claims be returned for a new dose reconstruction. This consists of 68 individual claims. A list of these claims will be forwarded to the Department of Labor. A new dose reconstruction will be completed for each of the claims using the new data.</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the effect of revising the LANL TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> It is not possible to precisely determine the effect of the change to LAMPF dose estimates on Probability of Causation without a new Dose Estimate. However, it is possible to determine if the LAMPF energy distribution was used in the original dose estimate. It is also possible to determine if an individual was assigned unmonitored neutron dose based on neutron to photon ratios and whether the ratio used will increase or decrease under the new revision to the TBD.</p>

<p>In order to determine the effect of these factors, the individual cases must be re-examined. Since the unmonitored neutron dose has the potential of affecting every claim, all claims completed prior to May 30, 2007 from Los Alamos National Laboratory with a Probability of Causation less than 50% will require a review. NIOSH will request claims be returned in which the LAMPF energy distributions were originally assigned using Revision 0 for a new dose estimate. NIOSH will also request the return of claims in which the original dose estimate utilized a neutron to photon ratio that has now increased. For all other claims, NIOSH will review the claim against any other revisions to other technical documents that may affect the claim. DOL will be provided with a statement for each claim indicating what changes the claim was reviewed against and why the change did not affect the particular dose estimate or the Probability of Causation calculation. For any claims where it is not possible to provide this statement without a new Dose Estimate, NIOSH will request that DOL return the claim for a new Dose Estimate.</p>

<p>NIOSH has determined that 300 claims meet the criteria for further review. The remaining cases with a probability of causation less than 50% (1 claim) were completed using revision 1 of the TBD. NIOSH will provide DOL with the list of 300 claims as well as a determination on each claim as to whether a new Dose Estimate is required.</p>

<p>May 18, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to report the impact of additional neutron dose data received from the Savannah River Site.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Dosimetry records are requested from the Savannah River Site for each claim received from the Department of Labor with Savannah River employment. This data is used in reconstructing the individuals' radiation dose. The Savannah River site notified NIOSH that additional data pertaining to neutron dosimetry was not sent for several claims. The additional data has since been received and added to the original dosimetry data.</p>

<p>Previously completed claims were re-evaluated to determine the affect of this new data on the individual claims. This Program Evaluation Report (PER) was prepared to report the results of that evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the effect of revising the Blockson TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> It is not possible to determine the magnitude of the change to dose without a new dose estimate. Since (as of issuance of this PER) no Blockson Chemical Company claims have yet been completed with the newest revision to the TBD, NIOSH is requesting that all Blockson Chemical Company claims with a Probability of Causation less than 50% be returned for a new estimate. A list of the entire population of the ninety-one potentially affected claims is attached. A new dose reconstruction will be completed for each of the claims using the latest revision to the Blockson TBD.</p>

<p>September 20, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the effect of revising Rocky Flats Plant TBDs and TIBs.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The Department of Labor indicated they will return all claims to NIOSH that were not determined to be a member of the SEC. Therefore, no evaluation of the modifications to dose reconstruction methodology is necessary. NIOSH will complete a new dose reconstruction for all claims returned by DOL using the current methodology. It should be noted that some of these claims will be unaffected by these modifications and some dose reconstructions may decrease as a result of removing dose associated with the SEC basis.</p>

<p>The last document to be revised to incorporate changes as a result of the SEC deliberation and designation was the external dose section of the Rocky Flats Technical Basis Document. This document was revised on August 17, 2007. Therefore, the returned claims should consist only of those approved prior to that date. This totals 590 claims, some of which NIOSH previously requested a return based on other PERs.</p>

<p>September 20, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the effect of revising the Chapman Valve TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> There were 31 Chapman Valve claims completed with a probability of causation below 50% prior to the revision to the TBD. Twenty one of these were completed using TIB 4. Because that document describes a higher dose estimate than the revision to the Chapman Valve TBD, no further evaluation is necessary for those claims. The remaining 10 Chapman Valve claims were completed using revision 0 of the Technical Basis Document. NIOSH is requesting that these claims be returned for a new dose estimate. A new dose reconstruction will be completed for each of the claims using the latest revision to the Chapman Valve TBD.</p>

<p>December 9, 2011</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Determines affect of revising the Reduction Pilot Plant TBD on previously completed claims.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Several changes in the Dose Reconstruction methodology occurred in the revision to the TBD. Most changes reflect a decrease in the estimated dose. However, the estimate of internal dose increased from 1956 through 1963 and for 1978 and 1979. The inhalation estimate for operators went from approximately 3.83 pCi/day (1400 pCi/yr) to 44 pCi/day. The original intake was the geometric mean of a lognormal distribution with a geometric standard deviation of 4.3. The new estimate is a single bounding value.</p>

<p>While the internal dose estimate increased, other exposure pathways decreased. Due to the nature of some of the changes, the magnitude of the effect on individual dose estimates will vary from claim to claim.</p>

<p><strong>Approved:</strong> December 9, 2011</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Several editorial changes and clarifications were included in the revision however these changes do not affect the estimated dose. Some changes may have decreased the dose but the only significant increase in the dose estimate is caused by an increase in the estimated intake rate for type S uranium from 12/1/1949 to 12/31/1953. The values are listed in Table 5-6 of both revisions.</p>

<p>April 5, 2012</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> New document to determine which previously completed claims require evaluation for the affect of revising the Blockson TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Revision 3 of the Blockson Chemical Company Technical Basis Document (DCAS-TKBS-0002) was issued on 12/20/2010. The previous version (revision 2) was issued on 11/21/2007. PER-020, issued on 7/31/2007, evaluated the effect of all changes that were made to the Blockson Chemical Company Technical Basis Document (TBD) prior to that date. This resulted in a request to DOL for the return of all previously completed Blockson claims that had a probability of causation of less than 50%. Once returned, a new dose reconstruction was completed for each using the version of the TBD current at that time. Revision 1 of the TBD was current when PER-020 was issued. However, revision 2 was issued a short time later on 11/21/2007 prior to any claims being completed using revision 1. Therefore, this PER only considered the changes that were made between revision 2 and revision 3. This information is summarized below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revision 0 all claims completed using revision 0 were requested returned (PER-020).</li>

<li>Revision 1 No claims were completed using this revision</li>

This PER considered the changes that were made between the current revision (revision 3) and all previous versions of the TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> For the 16 claims requiring further evaluation, dose was recalculated using all current dose reconstruction methods including the current version of the TBD. Only one claim resulted in a probability of causation greater than 50%. NIOSH will notify DOL of these results and request a return of the one case that would now be greater than 50%.</p>

<p>July 24, 2012</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> site specific appendix to Battelle-TBD-6001 (Appendix AA) was issued 6/15/2007. This was superseded by a stand-alone Technical Basis Document (TBD) on 4/4/2011 (DCAS-TKBS-0009 rev. 0). On 6/16/2011, revision 1 was issued to that document to correct an error. The changes made in revision 1 of the TBD caused external doses to operators to decrease during the operational period. No increase in any doses occurred in revision 1. Revision 0 however, did result in some increased dose when compared to Appendix AA. Therefore, Appendix AA is compared to Revision 1 in this PER in order to itemize the increased dose.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> As a result of this review, the revisions to the Hooker Electrochemical TBD did not result in the probability of causation of any previously completed claims rising to greater than 50%. A listing of those claims evaluated and their final disposition will be forwarded to the Department of Labor.</p>

<p>September 10, 2013</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Considers the effect of Revision 3 on claims that were completed using revision 2 or Revision 2 PC-1.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> For the ninety-one claims requiring further evaluation, dose was recalculated using all current dose reconstruction methods, including those in the current version of the TBD. From that recalculated dose, a new probability of causation was determined. The probability of causation remained below 45% for 86 of the 91 claims. For three of the remaining five claims, the probability of causation fell between 45% and 50%. In accordance with NIOSH procedures, IREP was run 30 times with 10,000 iterations for each run. The final probability of causation remained below 50% for all three claims. The final two resulted in a probability of causation greater than 50%. In both cases, this resulted primarily from the inclusion of monitored external dose between 1942 and 1948 that had not previously been included. NIOSH will notify DOL of all these results and request a return of the two claims that would now be greater than 50%.</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Determines which previously completed claims require evaluation for the affect of revising the Linde Ceramics Plant TBD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> The selection criteria resulted in 78 claims requiring further evaluation. For those claims, the dose was recalculated using all current dose reconstruction methods including the current version of the TBD. From that recalculated dose, a new probability of causation was determined. The probability of causation remained below 45% for 74 of the 78 claims. None of the cases resulted in a probability of causation between 45% and 50%. The four remaining cases had a probability of causation greater than 50%.</p>

<p>June 7, 2013</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> Determines the effect on previously completed claims due to revisions to ORAUT-OTIB-0005: Internal Dosimetry Organ, External Dosimetry Organ, and IREP Model Selection by ICD-9 Code</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Thirty-six claims were re-evaluated to determine the effect of revisions to OTIB-5. Two claims resulted in a new probability of causation greater than 50%, both as a result of changing the internal dose target organ from gallbladder to liver for code 155.1. None of the remaining thirty four claims exceeded a probability of causation of 45%. NIOSH will provide the Department of Labor with the list of the thirty-six claims evaluated under this PER. NIOSH will also request from the Department of Labor that the two claims now greater than 50% be returned to NIOSH for a new dose reconstruction.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong> All claims that had previously been completed with a probability of causation (POC) less than 50% were reviewed. This population included 54 claims. Nine of these claims had employment only prior to 1962 and were removed from further evaluation. One claim had been completed using the new template and was also removed from further evaluation. One of the remaining claims was returned to NIOSH by the Department of Labor (DOL) for a new dose estimate during the evaluation. This claim was completed with the new template and was removed from further evaluation under this PER.<br />
<br />
The dose for the remaining 43 claims was recalculated using the template and all applicable approved dose reconstruction methods. As a result, all 43 claims resulted in a probability of causation below 45%. NIOSH will provide DOL with the list of all the claims evaluated under this PER.</p>

<p>March 29, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> In the first version of the Rocky Flats Plant (RFP) Internal TBD (Jan 2004), it was noted that highly insoluble forms of plutonium were generated during the Rocky Flats fires. In response to the need to assess claims with potential exposure to this material, ORAUT-OTIB-0049 was developed. ORAUT-OTIB-0049 delineates the methods for assessing potential exposure to highly insoluble forms of plutonium, not only from the RFP fires, but at other sites in the complex that may have worked with this material.</p>

<p>March 21, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> October 25, 2006, Revision 01 of ORAUT-TKBS-0019-5, Occupational Internal Dose was issued as part of the biennial review process. During the biennial revision of this TBD section, the information provided in existing document was evaluated to ensure that the published isotopic ratios for transuranic (TRU) radionuclides meet the criteria of providing either an accurate or maximum dose estimate. The results of the evaluation indicated that the current ratios did not meet that goal. Information provided in existing references (particularly PACE and the University of Utah, 2000; BJC, 2000), as well as that found in a new reference was assessed with the result that new TRU isotopic ratios were developed and are included in the TBD as Tables 5-2 and 5-2a in the revised document.</p>

<p>On November 7, 2006 Revision 01 of ORAUT-TKBS-0019-4, Occupational Environmental Dose was issued. A revaluation of the source data for ORAUT-TKBS-0019-5 led to a revision to the TRU isotopic ratios (relative to uranium) for estimating dose from these radionuclides. In addition, the authors have been able to categorize these ratios according to specific processes and periods as described below in conjunction with ORAUT-TKBS-0019-5.</p>

<p>March 29, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> In 2004, it was noted that some Construction Trades Workers (CTW) at various sites were unmonitored during the early years of the complex. It was believed that these workers may have been exposed to external radiation and/or internal contamination above ambient and environmental levels without adequate monitoring. To address this issue, ORAUT-OTIB-0052 (Technical Information Bulletin: Parameters to Consider When Processing Claims for Construction Trade Workers) was developed to provide guidance on assessing CTWs with inadequate monitoring (either internal or external).</p>

<p>March 21, 2007</p>

<p><strong>About this Document:</strong> In April/May 2006, while reviewing dose reconstructions (DR) for an Idaho National Laboratory (INL) case and an Argonne National Laboratory - East (ANL-E) case, a particular notation ("no recordable dose") in the INL dosimetry response, as well as a similar notation ("no internal dose") in the ANL-E dosimetry response, was questioned. Both the INL and ANL-E points of contact (POC) were contacted and asked if this notation meant that the energy employee (EE) was not monitored. The INL POC responded that this notation meant that this particular EE may have been monitored but no internal dose was assigned. The ANL-E POC provided information that the EE had internal dose records for most years of his employment. [Although Argonne National Laboratory - West (ANL-W) requests are sent thru the Chicago Operations Office, the dosimetry records are provided by INL.]</p>

<p>In May/June 2006, it was determined that INL/ANL-W/ANL-E did not consistently include internal dose data in all of their individual dosimetry responses and that additional requests were needed for submitted cases with a POC less than 50%. For a particular EE, INL/ANL-W/ANL-E either provided all or none of the EE's internal dosimetry records. A good indicator that there may be internal dosimetry data is that the OCAS-INT-004 (check-box form) may have a hand-written note next to the internal dosimetry status section that says - "no internal dose" or "no recordable dose."</p>
