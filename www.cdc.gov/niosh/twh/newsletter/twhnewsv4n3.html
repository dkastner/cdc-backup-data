<p><em>Anita L Schill, PhD, MA, MPH, and L Casey Chosewood, MD, MPH</em></p>

<p>In most places across our country, autumn heralds a colorful, vibrant season of change. This issue of <em>TWH in Action!</em> is chock full of news about change. Since our last edition of e-News, we’ve been busy charting new horizons for Total Worker Health<sup>®</sup>.</p>

<p>We’re happy to report that “Total Worker Health” is now a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Our successful trademark registration is a testament to your tremendous support of Total Worker Health (TWH) over the past five years. It also recognizes the innovative nature of TWH and the resonance it has with a wide variety of stakeholders and audiences. Clear recognition of TWH as a unique approach helps us advance more impactful worker protection practices, programs, and policies and continues—with your help—to improve the well-being of our nation’s workers.</p>

<p>
	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Casey Chosewood' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/chosewood3n3.jpg'/>Remember the programmatic evolution we mentioned in our 
		<a href="twhnewsv4n2.html">last issue of the newsletter?</a>
	 We are now delighted to share a revised, expanded definition of Total Worker Health, which we believe more accurately reflects the unique contribution of TWH for tackling issues facing today’s workers and employers. The goal of this evolved TWH approach is to more accurately focus on the importance of safeguarding workers and expanding the number of ways that safer, healthier work advances worker well-being. Read more about our expanded program emphasis areas in this <a href="twhnewsv4n3.html#Total Worker Health Exclusive">Total Worker Health Exclusive</a>.</p>

<p>We are pleased to report the launch of the 
		<a href="../../topics/productiveaging/default.html">National Center for Productive Aging and Work</a>
	. The TWH-branded, virtual Center will advance the concept of <em>productive aging</em>—providing a safe and healthful work environment for all workers, and creating conditions that allow workers to function optimally and thrive from their first day on any job until they leave the workforce. To learn more about the exciting work of the new Center, please see <a href="twhnewsv4n3.html#Updates from the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health">Updates from the NIOSH Office for TWH</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Perspectives on Total Worker Health<br />
</strong>As the primary federal agency that conducts research and makes recommendations to prevent worker injury and illness, NIOSH is continuously innovating in response to the latest science and practice, emerging workplace risks and hazards, input from stakeholders, and direction from NIOSH scientists and leaders. Accordingly, the NIOSH Total Worker Health Program is shifting to further emphasize and clarify <em>what is Total Worker Health</em>. In July 2015, NIOSH revised its definition of “Total Worker Health” as policies, programs, and practices that integrate protection from work-related safety and health hazards with promotion of injury and illness prevention efforts to advance worker well-being. Simply put, the TWH approach integrates workplace interventions that protect workers’ safety and health with activities that advance their overall well-being.</p>

<p>
	<img class="border-right" alt='	Total Worker Health tagline' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/twhtagling.png'/>Pertinent to the 21<sup>st</sup> century workplace with workers and employers facing fierce economic pressures in a global marketplace, emerging forms of employment, new technologies, an increasingly older workforce, and the narrowing line between work and home life, Total Worker Health recognizes the linkages between health conditions that may not arise from work but that can be adversely affected by work. Total Worker Health also recognizes that as companies continue to confront the legacy hazards of the traditional workplace, such as traumatic injury and chemical exposures, the changing nature of work creates new opportunities for research and practice that seeks to understand the relationships to illness and injury. Total Worker Health advocates for integration of <em>all</em> organizational policies, programs and practices that contribute to worker safety, health and well-being, including those relevant to the control of hazards and exposures, the organization of work, compensation and benefits, built environment supports, leadership, changing workforce demographics, policy issues, and community supports. For a revised list issues that are relevant to advancing worker well-being through a Total Worker Health approach, please visit <a href="../totalhealth.html">/niosh/twh/totalhealth.html</a>.</p>

<p>Just as important as it is to describe what Total Worker Health is, it is equally important to describe what TWH is <em>not</em>. TWH is not a “wellness program” that has been implemented without simultaneously providing safe and healthful working conditions. TWH is not a collection of health promotion efforts implemented in a workplace where the work organization and structure contribute to worker injuries and illnesses. Workplace policies that discriminate against or penalize workers on the basis of health conditions or inadvertently create disincentives for improving health are not consistent with a TWH approach.&#160;</p>

<p>Keeping workers safe is the foundation upon which a TWH approach is built. Employers and employer-worker partnerships wishing to sustain and improve worker health must make occupational safety and health the priority—the foundation for all other health improvements. The TWH team at NIOSH will continue to work closely with partners and stakeholders to deliver evidence-based information to tailor workplace solutions with a TWH approach.

<h4>Small Businesses, Big Impact: The Nebraska Safety Council/WorkWell (<a href="https://www.nesafetycouncil.org/">NeSC</a>)</h4>

<p><em>Reid Anderegg</em></p>

<p><strong>Healthy Environments in Workplaces and Communities: </strong>The NeSC, a &#160;not-for-profit 501(c)(3) organization, has operated in Lincoln, NE, since 1961. Serving all of Nebraska, NeSC seeks to, “provide leadership and resources to promote a safe and healthy environment in our workplace and community.” With over 600 member organizations from more than 20 industries, including manufacturing, state and local governments, and construction, NeSC offers trainings, educational materials, and interactive consultations for its members. Unique to NeSC is its community focus which brings initiatives like safe driving programs to member organizations as well as community members. NeSC also offers integrated resources through the WorkWell division organizations to help employees achieve optimal well-being. Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (<a href="http://dhhs.ne.gov/Pages/default.aspx">NDHHS</a>) maintains a strong partnership with NeSC, and together each year they plan how to best use funding to meet the needs of member businesses and the surrounding communities. Such collaboration allows both NeSC and NDHHS to achieve goals and objectives set forth by NIOSH, <a href="../../../index.html">CDC</a>, and <a href="https://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>. NeSC’s pursuit of safe and healthy environments in workplaces and communities led them to achieve <a href="../affiliate.html">TWH Affiliate</a> status this year.</p>

<p><strong>Targeted Approaches for Small Business: </strong>With around 35% of its membership represented by small enterprises, NeSC seeks creative ways to meet the needs of their members. In 2014, <a href="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/hwce/">The University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence</a>, a NIOSH TWH-funded Center, awarded NeSC a community pilot grant. NeSC then offered hands-on resources to participating small businesses in the community via the pilot grant program. It focused on implementation of TWH interventions at three small Nebraska businesses in the cities of Lincoln and Beatrice: Lincoln Airport Authority (77 workers), Distribution Inc. (23 workers), and DK Contracting (21 workers). These three were selected based on previous interactions with leadership and their interest in TWH solutions.</p>

<p>NeSC’s targeted methods reflect four guiding goals for building TWH infrastructure:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seek to understand</li>

<li>Build the Roadmap</li>

<li>Implement</li>

<li>Evaluate and communicate.</li>
</ul>

<p>NeSC created customized solutions such as providing interactive training and consultations, assisting with policy development and communication, offering training modules, and providing practical support. Each of the businesses was already meeting state and federal guidelines for workplace safety, but sought assistance from NeSC to expand safety beyond regulatory requirements with a TWH approach. The businesses could begin thinking about safety not just from a regulatory stance but also from a proactive and preventive level for their workers.</p>

<p>Lincoln Airport Authority, with guidance from NeSC, held leadership discussions, a key influencer focus group, and a strengths/ weaknesses/opportunities/ threats (SWOT) analysis. The small, municipal airport developed a mission statement and a worker-led committee to guide organizational decision-making around TWH. Distribution Inc. focused on specific initiatives related to vending machines, sleep health, and tobacco cessation, for instance. DK Contracting systematically gathered worker feedback for the first time, to determine how to create a customized TWH approach at its workplace. As a result, workers selected health assessments, blood profiles, and health coaching as the first steps in creating a TWH-focused organization. These specialized offerings for each participating small business demonstrate the flexibility that a Total Worker Health approach can take to meet the needs of your business.</p>

<p><strong>Meet Businesses “Where They Are”: </strong>The Nebraska Safety Council/WorkWell experiences emphasize the importance of interaction between leadership and workers in establishing TWH programs, policies, and practices in small businesses. NeSC focuses on what each business is already doing to keep its workers safe, healthy, and well. This allows critical next steps to build upon the foundation already present at the business. By meeting the businesses “where they were” with safety, health, and well-being, NeSC developed infrastructure and allowed workers to lead changes, enabling the participating businesses to create sustainable impact. Leveraging partnerships, as NeSC did with the University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence, is another way to introduce TWH concepts into an organization.</p>

<p><a href="http://centerforworkhealth.sph.harvard.edu/"><strong>Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health and Well-being</strong></a><strong><br />
</strong>The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health and Well-being was a co-sponsor and steering committee member of an October 2015 strategic planning conference to improve the health and safety of commercial fishermen and their families. Fishing has the highest occupational fatality rate in the country, and those working in the industry have high suicide and illness rates. They are also likely to be uninsured because their work is often sporadic work and through multiple employers. The three-day event brought together 64 experts from various sectors with longstanding interests in the well-being of fishing communities in the Northeast. The aim was to develop a common vision for the future and an action plan to achieve it.</p>

<p>The Center will present results from its dissemination project at the November 2015 American Public Health Association meeting in Chicago, focusing on the implementation of Total Worker Health approaches in smaller organizations delivered by HealthPartners, Inc., a current research collaborator. Presenters will then discuss the Center’s work in Total Worker Health at the December meeting of the New England chapter of the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.</p>

<h4>6 New Publications from Centers of Excellence for Total Worker Health</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749379715003323"><strong>Total Worker Health Intervention Increases Activity of Sedentary Workers</strong></a><br />
In this randomized control trial from the University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence, investigators compared two intervention approaches to reduce sedentary behavior and improve health outcomes and productivity. Overweight/obese adults were put into: health protection only and integrated health protection/health promotion. Investigators found that the integrated-intervention group members significantly increased their occupational physical activity. Integrated-intervention recipients also saw improvements to certain key markers of physical health and productivity.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26340291"><strong>Validation of a New Metric for Assessing Approaches Integrating Health Protection and Health Promotion</strong></a><br />
Investigators at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-Being published a study validating their tool for assessing organizational actions and policies to protect and promote worker safety and health. The overall score was positively associated with outcome measures of activities and policies for health protection and promotion, supporting the tool’s reliability. This new measure might be useful to professionals interested in assessing TWH approaches and planning future actions within their organizations. The tool may also be of interest to researchers seeking to define and measure TWH approaches.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26122700"><strong>Length of Time Spent Working on a Commercial Construction Site and the Associations with Worker Characteristics</strong></a><br />
Another study led by the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health and Well-being found that approximately 56% of construction workers stayed on a given worksite for at least one month, which has implications for design and implementation of worksite-based intervention studies in construction. This length of stay was significantly associated with workers’ race/ethnicity, union status, title, trade, and musculoskeletal pain status. Workers who reported musculoskeletalpain had over two times the odds of being short-term (less than one month) versus long-term (greater than one month) on a site, when adjustments were made for trade, title, and race/ethnicity.</p>
