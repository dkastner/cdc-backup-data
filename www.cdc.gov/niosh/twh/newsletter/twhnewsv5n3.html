<p>Addressing the health and safety needs of the aging workforce continues to be a high priority. The <a href="../../topics/productiveaging/default.html">National Center for Productive Aging and Work</a> (NCPAW), a NIOSH Center hosted by the Office for Total Worker Health, focuses on aging across the working life and specifically on the concept of <em>productive aging</em>. This issue’s <a href="twhnewsv5n3.html#Total Worker Health Exclusive">Total Worker Health Exclusive</a> highlights the role that work plays in our lives as we age and the importance of designing work and workplaces that are &#160;age-friendly. NCPAW will co-host a free <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/webinar.html">NIOSH TWH Webinar</a> on productive aging and practical approaches organizations can take to meet the workplace health and safety needs of workers of all ages. <a href="https://niosh-connect.adobeconnect.com/e553630yx5n/event/registration.html?campaign-id=nl">Join us</a> on September 27<sup>th</sup> for this exciting educational opportunity.</p>

<p>We invite you to explore the latest publications from the <a href="../../TWH/centers.html">NIOSH Centers of Excellence for TWH</a>. The findings reported in these publications span multiple industries and workplace settings, including correctional facilities, nursing homes, and construction sites. In addition, these publications assess tools designed to help organizations better implement and evaluate their own workplace health and safety programs, policies, and practices. Read more about their results and findings in <a href="twhnewsv5n3.html#New Publications and Resources">New Publications and Resources</a>.</p>

<p>Within NIOSH, the Office for Total Worker Health continues a full portfolio of activities to advance the science and practice of Total Worker Health. In May, the <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2525718">Annals of Internal Medicine</a> released the final panel report on the NIH Pathways to Prevention Workshop, “Total Worker Health—What’s Work Got to Do With It?” The panel’s recommendations will be used to guide intramural and extramural research related to TWH. A separate <a href="http://annals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2525719">NIOSH editorial response to the panel’s recommendations</a> explains how NIOSH is responding to the panel’s recommendations for policy and practice guidance. Read more about the final report and the NIOSH response in <a href="twhnewsv5n3.html#Updates from the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health">Updates from the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health</a>.</p>

<p>We encourage you to take advantage of the latest Total Worker Health news, events, and more by joining the conversation on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/niosh_twh">@NIOSH_TWH</a>), on the <a href="mailto:NIOSH%20Total%20Worker%20Health%20LinkedIn%20Group">NIOSH Total Worker Health LinkedIn Group</a><u>,</u> or by email at <a href="mailto:twh@cdc.gov">twh@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

<h4>Productive Aging: Safe and Healthy Jobs throughout the Lifespan Benefit Workers, Employers, and Society</h4>

<p><em>Recently the staff of TWH in Action! caught up with Bermang Ortiz, Public Health Advisor, National Center for Productive Aging and Work, NIOSH and Juliann Scholl, PhD, co-director of National Center for Productive Aging and Work, NIOSH to discuss the concept of productive aging in the context of work and to get an updated look at the Center’s current portfolio.&#160;</em></p>

<p>Q: We've been talking about an aging workforce in the US for more than a decade now. Is this still an issue for employers and workers?</p>

<p>A:&#160; Absolutely. The U.S. population continues to age significantly. Today’s workforce is a reflection of that. For example, people 65 years or older accounted for about 15% of the U.S. population in 2015, but that percentage will increase to 22% by 2050.<sup>1</sup> In addition, workers 55 or older are increasing in number, and will account for nearly 25% of the labor force in 2024.<sup>2 </sup>For workers entering the job market now, it will not be uncommon to be working for six decades or more. It’s also important to note that today’s economy is demanding that many of us work longer than we planned. But as folks work longer, they’ll be exposed to both traditional work hazards and newly emerging ones that we have not well-characterized yet. Productive aging provides a useful perspective on how to address the challenges and opportunities presented by a lengthening of the working lifespan and the particular needs of an aging workforce.</p>

<p>Q:&#160; Your NIOSH Center focuses on the concept of “productive aging”.&#160; How did this concept first arise and how do you define it?</p>

<p>A:&#160; In the 1980s, gerontologists advocated for a more balanced discussion about aging, focusing more on the productive abilities of older individuals – not only on the strains they might pose to society’s resources. Out of this effort, the concept of <em>productive aging</em> emerged.<sup>3</sup> Since then, productive aging has been defined in different ways, but the common thread for us at NIOSH is that older individuals bring many assets to the workplace, such as greater job knowledge and safer work practices.</p>

<p>Drawing on this perspective, the <a href="../../topics/productiveaging/default.html">National Center for Productive Aging and Work (NCPAW)</a> defines <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/productiveaging/productiveaging.html"><em>productive aging</em></a> as an approach that emphasizes the positive aspects of growing older. It highlights the ways that workers can make important contributions to their own lives, their communities and organizations, and to society as a whole. &#160;Productive aging also highlights the need for workplaces to provide safe and healthy work environments that make it possible for workers to function optimally and thrive at <em>all</em> ages. Consistent with <em>Total Worker Health</em>®, NCPAW’s concept of <em>productive aging</em> takes a comprehensive, integrated approach to understanding the aging process across the life span, including the physical, mental, and social aspects of a worker’s well-being.</p>

<p>Q:&#160; There’s lots of stereotypes out there about older workers. I understand in NCPAW you are working to shatter some of these old myths.</p>

<p>A:&#160; We are! <em>Productive aging</em> helps us see past the stereotypes of older workers as being unproductive, unadaptable, or unsafe. Although aging can bring losses in physical and cognitive abilities that may affect job performance, older workers possess valuable years of work experience. They have fewer nonfatal injuries, have fewer conflicts with co-workers, and often have advanced skill levels. These positive attributes often more than compensate for declines in other areas. Because of individual variabilities in physical and cognitive losses, age alone is not a sufficient indicator of health and work capacity.</p>

<p>Q:&#160; What guidance can the Center offer organizations and workers?&#160;</p>

<p>A:&#160; The NCPAW <em>productive aging</em> perspective offers workers, employers, and occupational safety and health professionals a theoretical framework to follow for workers of every age. By developing and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/productiveaging/safetyandhealth.html">implementing programs and policies</a> that support the changing work capacities of workers over the working lifespan, employers can minimize work-related safety and health hazards. As a result, they will benefit from gains in recruitment, retention, competitiveness and productivity in the long term. Workplaces designed as “age friendly” meet multigenerational workforce needs by minimizing exposures to work-related safety and health hazards. For instance, “age friendly” workplaces are those that prioritize workplace flexibility, matching tasks to abilities, encourage teamwork, and invest in training to build worker skills. These and other practices ensure that <a href="../../topics/youth/default.html">younger workers</a> reach later life without injury or illness and older workers maximize their changing abilities by working without injury or illness.</p>

<p><strong>Promising Practices for <em>Total Worker Health</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Chia-Chia Chang, MPH, MBA, NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health</em><br />
<em>Deborah Roy, MPH, RN, COHN-S, CSP, L.L.Bean</em></p>

<p><strong>A Safety Redesign Jump-Starts Health and Well-Being for L.L.Bean’s Aging Workforce</strong></p>

<p>At <a href="http://www.llbean.com/">L.L.Bean</a>, Maine’s quintessential outdoor clothing and equipment company, the workforce is growing older. Although advancing age improves problem-solving and teamwork skills, it also adds risk, especially for older workers with physically demanding tasks. Acknowledging this truth helped L.L.Bean look beyond its established safety and health infrastructure, says Deborah Roy, MPH, RN, COHN-S, CSP, Corporate Director for Health, Safety, and Wellness. The company began taking decisive steps to optimize work processes and prevent injury and illness for <em>all</em> their workers, not only their older ones.</p>

<p><strong>Unique Workforce Considerations</strong></p>

<p>When people come to work at L.L.Bean, many become lifelong staff members because they know the company values its workers and embraces active living. However, low turnover means that employees who were hired in their 20s still have physically demanding jobs 25 or 30 years later.&#160; With an average employee age of 50, L.L.Bean’s team shares many of the age-related challenges common in workplaces nationwide. Reduced flexibility of the neck and spine, lower grip and lifting strength, and limits to range of motion all become more likely as workers age. Older workers are also more likely to have one or more chronic diseases such as arthritis, diabetes, and obesity. These issues make a focus on injury and illness prevention an absolute necessity.</p>

<p><strong>Integration of Prevention</strong></p>

<div style=" float: left; max-width: 200px; margin-right: 20px;">

	<div class="module-typeN  ">

			</div>
  
</div>

Ms. Roy’s team approached the challenge by focusing on one of the highest-risk areas: materials handling in the warehouse. L.L.Bean already had some critical preventive strategies in place: most workers usually were assigned materials-handling activities only twice a week and were rotated to other tasks every couple of hours. Workers were also given three sets of paid 5-minute rest and stretch breaks a day.&#160; Even still, Deborah felt more should be done.

<div style=" float: right; max-width: 350px; margin-left: 20px;">

						</figcaption>
		</figure>
			</div>
  
</div>

<p>L.L.Bean next turned to a variety of technologies to further reduce the safety and health risks to workers. Solutions for work processes included a mix of robotics, vacuum-driven lift-assist devices, and adjustable pallet lifts.&#160; This approach aligned well with the space, capital, and sustainability needs of the business. Now, for much of the year, a single robot and an operator are sufficient for handling products, but at peak volume the robot along with three workers using vacuum lift-assist devices and pallet lifts can safely do the work. This mix has helped the company to reduce risk while working with existing floor space and meeting changing demands. The vacuum lifts reduce weights to less than 10 pounds, and the pallet positioners allow loads to be at optimal height. Since the system was installed in the summer of 2014, no back injuries have been reported while using this technology. Feedback from workers has been very positive, particularly from those using the vacuum lift-assist devices, which make the work safer but still provide a sense of individual-level control.</p>

<p><strong>Jump-Starting Cardiovascular Fitness</strong></p>

<p>L.L.Bean piloted Jump Start, a voluntary conditioning program to benefit workers on and off the job. It aims to increase cardiovascular fitness and endurance, build muscle mass, and improve flexibility with a 12-week supervised aerobic activity and strength-training program. Sessions are offered three times a week, and workers can participate for 45 minutes of paid company time during their work shift. Besides providing a qualified fitness instructor, L.L.Bean also consults with physical therapy professionals to add customized program components to meet the physical demands of specific jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Early Results: Reduced Injuries, Improved Health and Well-Being</strong></p>

<div style=" float: left; max-width: 350px; margin-right: 20px;">

		</figure>
			</div>
  
</div>

<p>The program’s launch results exceeded expectations. In a 2013 analysis, L.L.Bean found that at the end of the 12 week program, participants showed improvements in muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility, as well as improvements in resting heart rate and cardiovascular endurance. Although weight reduction was not a goal of the program, 29% of the participants lost weight. In addition, 62% of workers reported having more energy and 29% reported less stress. The other focus of the program was to “jump start” employees into their own exercise program or get them interested in existing classes. L.L.Bean found that workers’ compensation cases were reduced from 10 to 2 cases in the same group of workers, with reductions in both compensation costs and medical costs. Adding these cost reductions to the estimated savings from avoided obesity, physical inactivity, and high blood pressure, the company estimates that there was a cost avoidance of $3.15 for every dollar spent (based on the company’s initial costs estimates in 2012).&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Leadership Commitment to Program Success</strong></p>

<p>L.L.Bean continues to offer Jump Start, tailoring it to other departments. It constantly improves the program according to results and feedback from participants. Ms. Roy emphasizes that leadership support is critical to the program’s success. “Employees need to feel truly supported by their supervisors when they are going to class every week. Providing paid company time for participation in the program and letting managers and workers plan the session schedule demonstrate the company’s commitment to worker safety and health,” she adds.</p>

<p>L.L.Bean is committed to ongoing organizational interventions to keep workers safe, healthy, and just as vibrant as life itself in the scenic state of Maine.&#160;</p>

<h3>Five New Publications from Centers of Excellence for Total Worker Health</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27158914">Improving safety climate through a communication and recognition program for construction: a mixed methods study</a><u>.</u> Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being implemented and evaluated the efficacy of a safety communication and recognition program (called B-SAFE) designed to encourage improvement of physical working conditions and hazard reduction in construction. B-SAFE demonstrated that a simple intervention engaging workers through strong communication infrastructure had a meaningful and positive effect on worksite safety.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27206128">Measurement tools for integrated worker health protection and promotion:&#160; Lessons learned from the SafeWell project.</a>&#160;This paper from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being presents a conceptual model, measurement tools, data collection processes, feedback reports, and initial test results of a measurement approach assessing health protection and health promotion. The assessment, designed to address knowledge gaps, was fielded in a study called SafeWell.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26542616">Participatory action research in corrections: The HITEC 2 program.</a> In this participatory action research program, investigators from CPH-NEW compared intervention programs between two correctional sites utilizing the Intervention Design and Analysis Scorecard (IDEAS) to plan interventions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27082022">Supporting employees' work-family needs improves health care quality: Longitudinal evidence from long-term care.</a> Investigators at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being analyzed qualitative interviews and quantitative data from supervisors and workers in nursing homes. Results suggest that organizational supportiveness of work-life issues is associated with better quality-of-care outcomes for nursing home residents.</p>

<p><a href="http://journals.lww.com/joem/Abstract/2016/05000/Validation_and_Dimensionality_of_the_Integration.12.aspx">Validation and dimensionality of the Integration of Health Protection and Health Promotion Score: Evidence from the PULSE small business and VA Medical Center surveys</a><u>.</u> Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being assessed the validity and dimensionality for the Indicators of Integration Score in two sample groups. Results indicate that Integration Score is a valid metric for assessing the integration of health protection and health promotion within different organizations and may be used as a unified index.</p>
