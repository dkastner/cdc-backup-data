<h2>Managers’ Buzz</h2>

<p><em>BY:</em>ANITA L. SCHILL, PhD, MPH, MA AND L. CASEY CHOSEWOOD, MD</p>

<p>Who is responsible for worker health? Workers? Employers? Healthcare providers? Government? Everybody? Nobody? These are the questions that Dr. John Howard, NIOSH Director, used to provocatively challenge the audience at the 27th National Conference on Health, Productivity and Human Capital hosted by the National Business Group on Health, September 25 – 27 in Washington, D.C. According to Dr. Howard, national economic health hinges upon the health of our workforce which is threatened by pervasive issues, such as obesity, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and aging. His bottom line: worker health is economic health. Keeping workers healthy and productive contributes to quality of life, local and national economies, and reduces the burden on entitlement programs such as social security disability insurance, social security, and Medicare.</p>

<p>The NIOSH TOTAL WORKER HEALTH<sup>&reg;</sup> (TWH) Program aims to advance worker safety, health and well-being by integrating workplace approaches to health protection and wellness promotion. As our thinking about this program has evolved Dr. Howard shared his expanded vision for the program in the context of worker health driving economic health. He envisions the program will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Help to reverse the alarming threats to population health by concentrating on the proportion of Americans who are workers.</li>

<li>Develop an evidence-based prevention framework for total worker health—using an integrated approach to health protection and health promotion to achieve greater worker well-being.</li>

<li>Promote and fund scientific research into what programs work best for which workers, employers, and shareholders.</li>

<li>Promote understanding of total worker health to the worker, the worker’s family, the employer, the insurer and economic growth of the Nation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Emerging efforts to measure Total Worker Health</h4>

<p><em>BY:</em>DEBORAH MCLELLAN PHD, MHS; RESEARCH SCIENTIST, DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE AND THE HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER FOR WORK, HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING; HEIDI HUDSON MPH; PROGRAM COORDINATOR, TOTAL WORKER HEALTH, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH; GLORIAN SORENSEN, PHD, MPH, PROFESSOR, HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR, HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER FOR WORK, HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH, DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE</p>

<p>The NIOSH TOTAL WORKER HEALTH<sup>&reg;</sup>(TWH) Program is built upon growing evidence indicating comprehensive policies and programs that concurrently address health promotion and health protection may be more effective in preventing disease and promoting health and safety than either approach alone. This integrated approach has been endorsed by the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the American Heart Association for cardiovascular health promotion, the International Association for Worksite Health Promotion, and the Institute of Medicine.</p>

<p>Despite its broad support, no shared definition or set of standard evaluation metrics exist for integrated approaches. A common definition and consistent metrics would facilitate the adoption and dissemination of integrated approaches at worksites. While measures exist to assess safety climate, workplace health promotion, and a “culture of health,” they tend to focus on either health promotion or health protection rather than on their integration. Existing surveys also tend to be long and may not be practical for many businesses, especially small ones, to complete.</p>

<p>As some examples of existing tools, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s Form 33 contains questions about organizational programs and policies pertaining to occupational safety and health, but was not intended to assess workplace health promotion (available at: <a id="anch_66" href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/safetyhealth/form33i.html">https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/safetyhealth/form33i.html</a>). The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine’s Corporate Health Achievement Award (available at: <a id="anch_68" href="http://www.chaa.org/">http://www.chaa.org/</a>) has over 240 questions that include ones that could be considered as measuring integrated approaches, but it still lacks questions on the psychosocial work environment and stress. NIOSH’s Essential Elements of Effective Workplace Programs and Policies (available at <a id="anch_70" href="../../TWH/essentials.html">/niosh/TWH/essentials.html</a>),were developed to guide employers interested in conducting comprehensive approaches to worker health, but were not intended to be used as concrete measures of integrated approaches. The Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) Center for Work, Health, and Well-being included in its <em>SafeWell Practice Guidelines </em>a scorecard (available at <a id="anch_71" href="http://centerforworkhealth.sph.harvard.edu/">http://centerforworkhealth.sph.harvard.edu/</a>) developed by HealthPartners Inc. that uses the NIOSH Essential Elements as an example of the type of practical tool that can be used by worksites. The <em>SafeWell Practice Guidelines</em> also identify specific assessments that may be used for planning integrated approaches that are sensitive to the needs and resources of different organizations.</p>

<p>In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in collaboration with the NIOSH developed a Worksite Health ScoreCard (HSC) (available at: <a id="anch_73" href="../../../dhdsp/pubs/worksite_scorecard.htm">/dhdsp/pubs/worksite_scorecard.htm</a>). This employer-based assessment tool addresses multiple health topics including chronic disease prevention, workplace stress and immunizations. In 2013, the HSC expanded to include occupational safety and health and the worksite’s health culture with the aim of using it as part of a suite of tools available for the National Healthy Worksite Program (NHWP) (See <a id="anch_74" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nationalhealthyworksite/index.html">/nationalhealthyworksite/index.html</a>). Working to provide health protection expertise for NHWP subcontractors, the Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace (CPH-NEW) at the University of Connecticut assisted with development and analysis of organizational climate and culture surveys. Combined, this suite of tools can be used for measuring integration of health protection and health promotion.</p>

<p>Overall, the Centers of Excellence to Promote a Healthier Workforce, funded by NIOSH, are conducting a series of activities for moving forward in providing definitions, metrics, and tools for evaluating an “integrated” approach to worker health. In November 2012, over 120 people from 16 states convened at the Total Worker Health Symposium<em>—Safe, Healthy and Cost-Effective Solutions</em> sponsored by the University of Iowa’s Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence (slides available at <a id="anch_75" href="http://www.hwce.org/twhsymposium">www.hwce.org/twhsymposium</a>) where the importance of shared metrics and evaluation were discussed. A special supplement to the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine </em>is currently in press which contains findings from the symposium. The supplement contains an article from the HSPH Center for Work, Health, and Well-being proposing a definition of integrated approaches to worker health, and key indicators and measures that may be used by employers and researchers to measure the extent to which integrated efforts are being implemented within an organization. For example, the extent of collaboration between functions responsible for worksite health promotion and occupational safety and health protection could be seen indicating the degree to which an organization is integrated.</p>

<p>The Centers of Excellence to Promote a Healthier Workforce recently hosted a session titled “Total Worker Health: Beyond conventional health promotion” on November 4, 2013 at the Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association in Boston. Issues of measurement and evaluation were addressed and discussed. Additionally, the HSPH Executive and Continuing Professional Education Program will present a course on <em>Work, Health, and Well-being: Integrating Wellness and Occupational Health and Safety in the Workplace</em> to be held January 27 – 29, 2014 in Boston, MA (<a id="anch_77" href="https://ecpe.sph.harvard.edu/programs.cfm?CSID=WHW0114">https://ecpe.sph.harvard.edu/programs.cfm?CSID=WHW0114</a>). The course will address methods for assessing integrated approaches to worker health protection and promotion.</p>

<p>NIOSH and the Centers of Excellence continue to research and provide national resources and tools for integrated approaches to worker health and well-being. The <em>TWH in Action!</em> quarterly enewsletter, and NIOSH’s science blog will cover more of these in the upcoming months. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><em>Editors’ Note:</em> The NIOSH intramural research program is addressing data gaps regarding the TWH approach by funding several new projects in this area. These projects are just getting underway, but one of the first steps for each of them is to plan how to measure the extent to which integrated programs exist within organizations participating in the studies. Measures that are under development range from guided interview questions to surveys that will be completed by key informants. For example, small businesses participating in the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation Workplace Wellness Grant Program have been completing an 11 question survey instrument to measure the integration of occupational safety and health programs with wellness programs; NIOSH will evaluate the instrument next year.

<h2>Healthier Feds</h2>

<p>A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that the quality work environment is a predictor of health behaviors. In support of this notion, the federal government is providing opportunities for advanced health and well-being in its own workforce. The purpose of this section is to spotlight ways in which the federal community is improving the health and safety of federal employees.</p>

<h4>Improving the Health, Safety, and Productivity of Our Federal Employees</h4>

<p><em>BY:</em>CONSTANCE FRANKLIN, MPA, PUBLIC HEALTH ANALYST, NIOSH; LCDR JYL C. WOOLFOLK, MPH, CHES, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, FEDSTRIVE; AND, DAMON THOMPSON, DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH COMMUNICATIONS, FEDERAL OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH</p>

<p>
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='	Fed Strive logo' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/images/twh_nl_v3n1_1.jpg'/>At a time when most federal agencies are being asked to “do more with less,” Federal Occupational Health (FOH) helps by providing services designed to improve the health, safety and productivity of federal employees. A part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), FOH works in partnership with federal agencies and organizations across government to design and deliver solutions that meet their occupational health needs.</p>

<p>As the largest provider of occupational health services in the federal government, FOH serves more than 360 agencies and reaching 1.8 million federal employees. FOH’s clinical, work/life, and environmental health services aims to help agencies increase productivity by reducing the time that employees spend away from work on visits to the doctor’s office or dealing with personal issues.</p>

<p>In 2009, President Obama hosted a business roundtable with major corporate leaders to examine how they were driving down employee health and wellness costs. The common theme that emerged from those discussions was that the private sector achieved success through an emphasis on strong, on-site health and wellness programs. Investing in prevention, these corporate giants saw a decrease in measures like emergency room visits, and inpatient and outpatient care, along with an increase in the services that they offered onsite.</p>

<h4>FedStrive</h4>

<p>That discussion then turned to an examination of how such services were being offered within the federal government. As a result, in November 2009, HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the creation of FedStrive – an FOH program that provides health, wellness, and work/life services through an comprehensive approach to assist agencies in establishing a culture of health and high performance.</p>

<p>One of the keys to this data-driven approach is the Health Risk Appraisal (HRA), a survey that helps FedStrive participants identify their potential health risks through a review of their lifestyle practices and family health histories. The results allow employees to set their own health goals, while FedStrive staff can guide them to services that help them meet those goals.</p>

<p>FedStrive was launched as a pilot project in 2010.Within the first two-and-a-half years, the program saw an increase in the number of employees who completed the HRA, as well as reductions in unhealthy behaviors, risk factors, cholesterol levels, and weight.</p>

<p>At that point, the program was extended to federal employers nationwide, with an initial concentration on regional centers where HHS has a strong presence. As of December 2013, FedStrive will have been formally launched in 10 HHS Regions. However, any federal agency that has an agreement with FOH is eligible to opt for FedStrive.</p>

<p>“FedStrive Virtual” is a recently launched option that gives employees access to an online Health Risk Appraisal, as well as lifestyle coaches available by telephone. This allows employees located in different areas the flexibility of being served without having to physically enter a wellness center to get assistance. This approach is currently being implemented for Veteran’s Administration 350,000 employees.</p>

<h4>Primary Goals of FEDstrive:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Keep low risk behaviors at low risk</li>

<li>Reduce high risk behavior risk factors among moderate to high risk populations</li>

<li>Provide evidence-based health promotion programming from HRA data</li>

<li>Contain costs to effectively allocate resources</li>
</ul>

<h4>Incentives – Organizational Leadership</h4>

<p>While financial incentives are very popular components of many private-sector programs, the federal government places a number of limitations on the use of such incentives. As an alternative, FedStrive is launching an effort to provide “human incentives.” An HHS customer survey showed that 25 percent of participants said they would be more likely to complete their HRA each year if they were rewarded with an opportunity to have lunch with their director or other HHS leaders. This corresponded with private-sector research showing that strong support or “buy-in” by an organization’s leadership is an important element of a successful workplace health and wellness program. FedStrive is working to establish an incentive program that will allow employees to more closely engage with their leadership. At HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., FedStrive has already achieved great success in attracting employee participation in health walks with the U.S. Surgeon General.</p>

<h4>Evaluation</h4>

<p>FedStrive uses various mechanisms in evaluation, including aggregate HRA data and program participation measurement. Leading public health researchers help analyze the data, and results are shared with senior level officials who use the findings to identify program successes and lessons learned, and make programmatic adjustments.</p>

<h4>Communication</h4>

<p>FedStrive has an online newsletter – “Spotlight” – that features stories from employees who have succeeded in reaching their health goals. It provides an opportunity for employees to hear about FedStrive from their peers, and a chance for FedStrive to recognize individual achievement.</p>

<p>FOH Director, Dr. Gene Migliaccio , tells the story of how proud he was when he overheard an elevator conversation in which an employee was excited about being featured in “Spotlight.” The gentlemen mentioned how he’d been asked to tell his story in the newsletter because he has lost 50 pounds. He said that he’d had a great experience with the program and that the FedStrive nurse had been with him every step of the way, providing encouragement and support.</p>

<h4>Lessons Learned</h4>

<ul>
<li>If an agency does not already have a wellness council with representation across the agency, it is critical to establish one.</li>

<li>Within the council, focus on developing new, innovative ways to increase program participation, create guidelines that encourage participation, create program champions and recognize health improvements and achievements.</li>

<li>It is important to communicate program benefits.</li>

<li>Start employee buy-in before a launch.</li>

<li>Engage senior leadership and mid-level management to encourage participation.</li>
</ul>

<p>As HHS Secretary Sebelius said in a discussion of FOH and FedStrive: “The work we do in HHS is important to the Nation’s health. I am equally concerned about your own health. Take care of yourself, so that you can continue to take care of our Nation.”</p>

<h2>News from our Partners</h2>

<h4>Despite Furlough, NIOSH Grantees Foster Collaboration for First Time in Denver</h4>

<p>On October 3 and 4, representatives from all of the NIOSH extramurally funded centers met for the first time at the University of Denver. The meeting was sponsored by NIOSH’s Office of Extramural Programs. However, NIOSH representatives were unable to attend due to the lapse of FY14 appropriations.</p>

<p>The purposes of this historic meeting included exploring opportunities for future collaboration and research integration across Centers and identifying performance metrics and evaluation strategies for multidisciplinary research and training centers.</p>

<p>Dr. Glorian Sorensen of the Harvard School of Public Health’s Center for Work, Health, &#38; Well-being presented on the topic of Integration of NIOSH Intramural and Extramural Programs, citing collaborative practices from the Total Worker Health Program Centers of Excellence as ways to reduce duplication, improve quality of work, and increase impact of the project.</p>

<h2>New Initiatives and Resources</h2>

<h4>Mental Health Resources for Canadian Employers</h4>

<p>Earlier this year, the voluntary National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace was released. The Standard, championed by the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), is designed to help employers improve how they protect mental health in the workplace. The MHCC is now launching a three-year case study research study designed to follow the journey of 10-15 Canadian employers as they become industry leaders in workplace mental health. As these organizations work through the staged implementation of the Standard, the MHCC will provide observations and insights at no cost to each organization.</p>

<p>Listed below are some actions employers can start doing today!</p>

<h4>Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation - Workplace Wellness Grant Program</h4>

<p>In 2012, Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation (OBWC) launched a Workplace Wellness Grant Program (WGP), which will provide up to $4 million in funds over four years to implement wellness programs at an estimated 266 employers with 13,000 employee participants. After each year of funding, participating employers turn in an annual case study, which includes a survey-based measure of the integration of occupational safety and health programs with wellness programs. The 11 question survey instrument was developed for employers participating in the WGP and has not been validated yet. The first case studies were completed earlier this year. The instrument is available at <a id="anch_179" href="http://www.ohiobwc.com/downloads/blankpdf/SH-30.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ohiobwc.com/downloads/blankpdf/SH-30.pdf</a> (Section II). OBWC and NIOSH are collaborating on a research project to determine the effectiveness and economic return of the WGP and to help to understand the extent and impact of wellness program integration with traditional occupational safety and health programs.</p>

<h2>TOTAL WORKER HEALTH<sup>&reg;</sup> Fast Facts:</h2>

<h4>What is “employee engagement”?</h4>

<p>Employee engagement is a psychosocial measure that is defined differently by various organizations and research groups, but in general captures the morale of the workforce: a combination of emotional attachment to one’s work (<a id="anch_183" href="http://www.scarlettsurveys.com/papers-and-studies/white-papers/what-is-employee-engagement">Scarlett Surveys</a>) and willingness to go above and beyond on the job (<a id="anch_185" href="http://www.adp.com/~/media/RI/whitepapers/Employee%20Engagement%20vs%20Employee%20Satisfaction%20White%20Paper.ashx">ADP</a>). In recent years many research and business groups such as Gallup have studied the relationship between employee engagement and everything from worker performance to company profit to employee retention, with the goal of improving companies’ bottom lines as well as improving worker experience and well-being.</p>
