<h2>Managers’ Buzz</h2>

<p><em>BY: </em>ANITA L. SCHILL, PhD, MPH, MA AND L. CASEY CHOSEWOOD, MD</p>

<p>The New Year is a time for both reflection on the past and looking forward to the future.&#160;The past year was filled with many highlights including the Third Annual NIOSH National Expert Colloquium on TOTAL WORKER HEALTH<sup>&reg;</sup> (TWH<sup>&reg;</sup>), the publication of the Proceedings of the 2012 Total Worker Health Symposium coordinated by the University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence, and reaching nearly 60,000 subscribers to <em>TWH in Action!</em></p>

<p>This coming year holds much promise for an unsurpassed level of activity related to Total Worker Health.&#160;Perhaps the most exciting event on the horizon is the first-ever International Symposium to Advance TOTAL WORKER HEALTH to be convened on October 6–8, 2014 at the Natcher Conference Center, National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. This 3-day event will showcase the latest TWH-related research, programs, practices, and policy.&#160;The call for abstracts has already been published, and is available at <a id="anch_53" href="http://www.eagleson.org/conferences/total-worker-health/call-for-abstracts">http://www.eagleson.org/conferences/total-worker-health/call-for-abstracts</a>.</p>

<p>NIOSH’s Total Worker Health Webinar Series will also launch in 2014.&#160;On February 25 from 3:30pm to 5pm EST, we will co-host our first webinar “Making the Case for Total Worker Health: An Overview of Opportunities and Approaches” with the Center for Promotion of Health in the New England Workforce, and feature presentations by thought leaders Dr. Laura Punnett and Dr. Ron Goetzel. Find more information, including webinar registration, in <a id="anch_55" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/TWHnewsv3n1A.html#11">Updates from the NIOSH TOTAL WORKER HEALTH Program</a>, or visit <a id="anch_56" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/webinar.html">/niosh/TWH/webinar.html</a>.</p>

	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Casey Chosewood' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/chosewood3n3.jpg'/>This spring we anticipate the Institute of Medicine (IOM) will conduct a public workshop in Washington, DC, to identify prevalent and best practices that integrate occupational health and safety with health promotion in small, medium, and large workplaces. The workshop will feature invited presentations and discussions on identifying the value of integrating programs, measuring success, barriers to full integration, and innovative approaches. IOM will publish a summary highlighting the presentations and discussions. Stay connected for more information!</p>

<p>Once again, this issue of <em>TWH in Action!</em> is chock-full of feature articles and news about upcoming events&#160;you won’t want to miss. In response to your request for information on tools that can be used for measuring the economic effectiveness and making the case for integrated health protection and health promotion programs, Dr. Tapas Ray from the NIOSH Economics Program explains how health-related quality of life measures can be used to shape the outcome evaluation of integrated interventions in this issue’s <a id="anch_57" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/TWHnewsv3n1A.html#9">TOTAL WORKER HEALTH Exclusive</a>.</p>

<h3>Measuring Cost Effectiveness of Total Worker Health Programs: Making the Case for Health-Related Quality of Life</h3>

<p><em>BY:</em>TAPAS K RAY, PHD, ECONOMIST, NIOSH</p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p>Recently, health research has experienced a paradigm shift in how the concept of “health” has been measured. While traditionally concepts such as morbidity, mortality, and injuries have shaped measurement efforts, now researchers are seeking to redefine health by its positive aspects—for example, satisfaction, well-being, productivity, health utility, and quality of life.</p>

<p>A similar development in the public health arena, especially occupational health, has been the push to define worker health in a holistic framework, resulting in a more integrated interpretation of worker health as consequence of both work and outside work-related factors.&#160;This is in contrast to the traditional separation of occupational health from its non-occupational counterpart in the past. In this new field of research and practice, one of the questions gaining importance is how best to understand the economic effectiveness or cost effectiveness of such integrated programs. While the benefits of <em>total worker health</em> programs are backed by strong theoretical justifications, measuring the cost effectiveness of such integrated programs in real terms is an issue that merits consideration.</p>

<h4>Limitations of current cost-effectiveness measures</h4>

<p>To discuss “cost effectiveness” of programs, one implicitly assumes the presence of an outcome variable, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, which suitably captures program benefits, and to which intervention costs are compared. Though health promotion programs generally target individual health habits, while safety programs target injuries and illnesses, the outcome measure is ultimately the same: personal health and well-being of workers. Measuring effectiveness in terms of existing metrics—reduced injuries, illnesses, compensation claims—would at best give us a partial picture of potential gains since the majority of these programs theoretically reduce the <em>probability</em> of such incidents and not actual incidents.</p>

<p>Focusing on individual behavioral health outcomes like smoking cessation has its own set of challenges. Finding a single definition for a behavioral health outcome can be challenging, given the multidimensionality of health. Tracking population health through the use of biomechanical indicators has high <em>transaction</em> and <em>information costs</em>. In addition, considerable time is needed before behavioral changes and the resulting reductions in risks visibly alter population health. Most cost-effectiveness studies span over five to ten years of analytical time period.</p>

<h4>Driving towards a solution: Health-Related Quality of Life</h4>

<p>What is needed is an “impact outcome measure” for integrated health protection and health promotion programs that captures outcomes in terms of increased health, productivity, safety, and well-being of workers. Economists and health scientists more recently made strides to measure the perceived health-related well-being of economic agents. The increasing importance of such measures is evident from international pursuits towards finding well-being related economic growth measure as an alternative to gross domestic product (GDP). Health-related quality of life (HRQL) instruments, like the US-based Medical Outcomes Study 36 (SF-36), Europe-based EoroQoL (EQ-5D), and Canada-based Health Utility Index (HUI), evaluate a range of perceived mental and physical health dimensions to construct a health utility score or a health related well-being score. Changes in these scores in pre- and post-intervention scenarios reflect intervention benefits. Often, these utility scores are used to construct quality adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs are predominantly used in measuring intervention benefits in medical decision making and public health literature in the US. Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) uses disability adjusted life years (DALYs) to estimate health hazard burden. One such measurement tool, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL), is used to track public health status.</p>

<p>Although no HRQL instruments exist specifically designed to measure quality of life related to workplace health and safety, generic HRQL instruments can be modified to fit such needs. Keeping an eye on the applicability of quality of life measures, the <a id="anch_66" href="../../programs/econ/index.html">NIOSH Economics Program</a> organized a seminar last year inviting practitioners from other government and non-government agencies. Though not specifically geared towards TWH, participants discussed the importance of combining morbidity and mortality as intervention outcome measures and identified research priorities.</p>

<p>Like TWH research, application of HRQL as outcome measures of health interventions is also in its early years of development. Harnessing the power of both fields in understanding the economic effectiveness of integrated programs in the workplace seems useful, if not inevitable. HRQLs are mostly subjective measures but the recent changes in healthcare laws may provide future opportunities to connect electronic health records of workers to their HRQL scores, providing a complete picture of workplace-factored biological health and human satisfaction or well-being from that health. More information on HRQL can be found at <a id="anch_67" href="http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/QoLWBabout.aspx">http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/QoLWBabout.aspx</a> or <a id="anch_69" href="../../../hrqol/index.html">/hrqol/</a>.</p>

<h2>Healthier Feds</h2>

<p>A growing body of scientific evidence indicates that the quality of one’s work environment is a predictor of health behaviors. In support of this notion, the federal government is providing opportunities for advanced health and well-being in its own workforce. The purpose of this section is to spotlight ways in which the federal community is improving the health and safety of federal employees.</p>

<h3>How NASA is Living <em>Total Worker Health</em></h3>

<p><em>BY: </em>CATHERINE M. ANGOTTI, RD, SENIOR ADVISOR ON OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF HEALTH AND MEDICAL OFFICER, NASA</p>

<p>National Aeronautical Space Agency (NASA), an executive Federal Agency dedicated to Space flight, highly values exploration.&#160;The Agency’s exploration success depends on employees’ detailed attention to the safety and health of the astronauts and their fellow Earth-bound employees.&#160;For decades NASA’s occupational health programs have maximized the opportunities of national health initiatives as well as internal resources. And, they have led the way to improve internal programs for the maintenance of a workforce that operates at its highest level of physical and mental well-being.</p>

<h4>A Frontrunner in Integrating Employee Health</h4>

<p>Through the years, NASA has maintained a vigorous health and safety program by utilizing annual Center self-assessments and triennial week-long on-site assessments. Remarkably, each year, the Agency has held one of the lowest Federal Workers’ Compensation charge back bills and has excelled in various Federal-wide initiatives targeting accidents and injuries, such as Safety, Health and Return to Employment (<a id="anch_76" href="http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/share/index.htm">SHARE</a>) and Protecting Our Workers and Ensuring Reemployment (<a id="anch_78" href="http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dfec/power/index.htm">POWER</a>).&#160; Confident of its programmatic quality, NASA asked the Institutes of Medicine to conduct an independent evaluation of the occupational health programs at five randomly selected operational sites.&#160; That 2-year effort culminated in the 2005 Institutes of Medicine’s (IOM) publication, <a id="anch_80" href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2005/Integrating-Employee-Health-A-Model-Program-for-NASA.aspx">Integrating Employee Health</a>.</p>

<p>NASA was optimistic that the results of the IOM study would confirm the presence of the key aspects that support a business case for <em>total worker health</em>.&#160;These eight major aspects of an ideal workplace include: 1) Health Status; 2) Life Expectancy; 3) Disease Care Costs; 4) Health Care Costs; 5) Productivity (including absenteeism and presenteeism); 6) Recruitment and Retention; 7) Company Visibility; and, 8) Social Responsibility.</p>

<p>While overall a good report, two of their fifteen findings found room for improvement.&#160;Those findings included having a single standardized HRA, which we were able to do almost immediately by selecting the Mayo Clinic HRA. The other finding was to establish an electronic health record system (EHRS) for total health integration.&#160;Fortunately, NASA had already performed a feasibility study a few years earlier, which recommended the use of an EHR commercial off the shelf product and commence at a given point in time rather than try to capture legacy data. NASA has now had an EHRS for about 2 years, which collects and stores data from the employee’s annual health maintenance exam as well as all required surveillance exams.</p>

<p>Data gleaned from NASA’s EHRS baseline data will help drive continuous program improvement by identifying areas of weakness as well as areas of progress. This data will help ensure that NASA has the means for continued maintenance of a healthy worksite in the future.</p>

<h4>Matching Up with Healthy People Physical Activity Goals</h4>

<p>NASA’s first highly successful organized initiative started in 1990 as a 10-year effort to motivate our employees to be more physically active by meeting the exercise goals set forth in Healthy People 2000.&#160;The program “Exercise for the Health of It” was a competition between all our Centers It was initiated with the program’s poster being flown aboard the Shuttle while the crew filmed themselves exercising in space.&#160;The entire crew subsequently signed the poster in a ceremony at the Headquarters with the NASA Administrator and a President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports’ (PCPFS) spokesperson.</p>

<p>Motivation for this multi-year effort capitalized on employee competitive spirit and collaboration with the PCPFS. At the Annual Occupational Health Meeting, PCPFS’s celebrity athlete spokesperson presented an engraved plaque to the new winning Center.&#160;The Center would retain and display the plaque until the next Annual Occupational Health Meeting, when competition results would determine the next winner and the plaque would rotate to another Center. This program was very well received and had better than expected employee participation, likely due to the competitive nature between Centers.</p>

<h4>Supporting Employee Mental Well-being and Behavioral Health</h4>

<p>NASA also has long had active Employee Assistance Programs (EAP) addressing major employee challenges such as the retirement of the Shuttle program, hurricanes Katrina and Ike, and workplace violence. NASA EAP has also been present to help address a myriad of individual personal challenges. NASA EAP also supports a range of occupational health programs, by supplementing the physical health information provided with behavioral health techniques to facilitate change, and also through consulting on programs and program designs.&#160;In addition, NASA EAP provides analysis and insight on employee behavioral health and mental well-being for Agency Management from data analysis of trends and potentially sentinel events to holding quarterly video teleconferences with EAP counselors to discuss pertinent events, ensuring that direct lines of communication to senior leadership are open.&#160;</p>

<p>One major initiative is the Critical Incident Stress Management (CISM) program at NASA, which provides training at all Centers with EAP counselors and designated CISM teams.&#160;In times of crisis, such as the devastation in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Center EAPs had specialized training that gave them the programmatic and personal skills and relationships necessary to volunteer and help out at the others Centers that were in need, pulling together for the common good.</p>

<p>Every day, whether on earth or in outer space, NASA works to bring to life the principles of <em>total worker health</em>, showing their ongoing commitment to improve the health and well-being of their workforce.</p>
