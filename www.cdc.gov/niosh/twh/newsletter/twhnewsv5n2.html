<p>Did you get it or miss it? Despite our best efforts—including tweets, a press release, an email blast and a LinkedIn post—you may have missed the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health’s recent release of the National Total Worker Health Agenda and NIOSH Response to Summarized Stakeholders’ Comments. The Agenda outlines research directions for NIOSH and the Nation for the next decade. With strategic goals spanning four key areas—research, practice, policy, and capacity-building—the Agenda aims to enhance our knowledge of the Total Worker Health (TWH) approach to advancing worker safety, health and well-being. Learn more about the National Total Worker Health Agenda and NIOSH Response to Summarized Stakeholders’ Comments by reading <a href="twhnewsv5n2.html#Updates from the NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health">Updates from the NIOSH Office for TWH</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever been curious about the concept of “health climate”, you won’t want to miss the article by Dr. Zandra Zweber, an industrial research psychologist specializing in health climate. Dr. Zweber explains that health climate stems from the idea that people are highly influenced by their social environment, including their workplaces. Read more about Dr. Zweber’s take on health climate and how it can help organizations complement their approaches to workplace safety, health, and well-being, in the <a href="twhnewsv5n2.html#Total Worker Health Exclusive">Total Worker Health Exclusive</a>.</p>

<p>As always, you can keep track of the latest TWH news, events, and more by joining the conversation on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/niosh_twh">@NIOSH_TWH</a>), on the <a href="mailto:NIOSH%20Total%20Worker%20Health%20LinkedIn%20Group">NIOSH Total Worker Health LinkedIn Group</a>, or by email at <a href="mailto:twh@cdc.gov">twh@cdc.gov</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>Can the workplace be a “social health network?”</strong></h4>

<p><em>Zandra Zweber, Ph.D.<br />
University of Connecticut &#38; Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace (CPH-NEW) Alumni Research Affiliate and Industrial Psychologist specializing in workplace health climate</em></p>

<p>With recent changes to health care and the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, many companies are implementing workplace health programs and initiatives. Although this is a positive step toward facilitating a healthy workforce, it remains to be seen whether simply having programs will result in better health.</p>

<p>In order to measure the success or progress toward achieving Total Worker Health (TWH), organizations need to do more than just tally up the number of worker safety, health, and well-being programs they have in place. Equally important is workers’ perspective of the climate for health that exists within the organization. Social climate has an impact on the decisions (including health decisions) that individuals make as well as the resources that are available to make those decisions. To maximize the impact of workplace health and safety programs, support for initiatives needs to come from three levels: the organization, the supervisors, and fellow workers.</p>

<p>A new tool has been developed for organizations to identify possible shortcomings in any one of these three facets of health climate, the <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2015-51743-001">Multifaceted Organizational Heath Climate Assessment</a> (MOHCA) scale.<sup>1</sup> &#160;Research findings have shown that strength in all three facets of health climate are associated with improvements in health and well-being outcomes.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>For example, Company A might spend thousands of dollars putting on health programs that workers can attend during lunch. These opportunities may not, in themselves, catalyze changes in health behavior, because the social climate for health that exists in Company A can impact whether workers even attend the programs.&#160; However, if the supervisors participate or encourage their direct reports to take the time to participate, that signals a high value and support for their direct reports to care about their health. If this supervisor support did not exist, or if workers criticized each other for attending health programs because it is counter to their workplace attitude, then what Company A really needs is an intervention aimed at improving the health climate in order to make their health programs more successful.</p>

<p>Introducing workplace safety and health programs alone cannot be considered a complete solution for achieving TWH. Rather, organizations should also foster a social climate that is conducive to safety, health, and well-being. Organizations that recognize the importance of a positive health climate will be more successful at moving the needle on health outcomes. Next time you have an opportunity to do a survey in your organization, find out how workers rate health climate, as a first step in creating a more positive health culture in your organization. This is an area where management can lead by example and set the course for a healthier workplace.</p>

<p><strong>Recent release of the National Total Worker Health Agenda</strong></p>

<p>
	<img class="pull-right margin-left-ten" alt='	cover of the TWH agenda' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/images/agenda.jpg'/>The NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health recently released the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/nationalagenda.html">National Total Worker Health Agenda and NIOSH Response to Summarized Stakeholders’ Comments</a> to define and prioritize occupational safety and health research, practice, and prevention activities for the nation (2016–2026). The National Total Worker Health Agenda’s strategic goals are broadly organized into four categories: Research, Practice, Policy, and Capacity-Building. Intermediate and activity/output goals are included for each. Through investments in research and the transfer of this research into practice, the long-term vision of TWH is to protect the safety and health of workers and to ad­vance their well-being by creating safer and healthier work environments, and ad­dressing employment-related issues. It is anticipated that this vision will be achieved through knowledge generation, translation of that knowledge into practice, devel­opment of policy guidance, and building workforce capacity. Creation of a National Total Worker Health Agenda is an important step toward making this vision a reality.</p>

<p><strong>Release of National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention Workshop final report</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Total Worker Health—What’s Work Got To Do with It?</em>&#160; <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/programs-events/pathways-to-prevention/workshops/total-worker-health">Pathways to Prevention Workshop</a> in December 2015 offered an opportunity to look critically at the state of the scientific evidence for Total Worker Health. The final report from the workshop panel will be released later this month in the <a href="http://annals.org/">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Partnering with NIH to promote Healthy Vision Month</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/productiveaging/default.html">NCPAW</a> is collaborating with Dr. Carl Cates at Valdosta State University in Georgia, Associate Dean of the College of Arts and an instructor in health communications. Dr. Cates reached out to NCPAW to request NIOSH assistance with a student-led project creating public service announcements on aging and work. NCPAW will mentor and provide guidance to the students as they create short interview video messages with workers in construction, public safety, and other trades, talking about their experiences with aging and workplace safety.</p>

<p>On April 18, the Center was represented on a panel of translation researchers from the NIOSH <a href="../../contact/im-eid.html">Education and Information Division</a> (EID) at the CDC Translation Day in Atlanta. The event provided CDC personnel the opportunity to discuss various projects that lead to the development of evidence-based programs, practices, and policies. NCPAW’s presentation reviewed NIOSH research on aging and showcased current work translating aging-related research outputs into products and programs that help organizations facilitate aging-friendly workplaces. Also highlighted was a productive aging model that informs the steps NCPAW is taking to evaluate current aging-related products in the construction sector, to identify partners for product development, and to determine how such products will maintain productivity as workers age.</p>
