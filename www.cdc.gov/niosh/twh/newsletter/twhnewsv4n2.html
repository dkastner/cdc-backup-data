<h2><a id="1" name="1"> </a>Managers' Buzz</h2>

<p>ANITA L. SCHILL, PhD, MPH, MA<br />
L. CASEY CHOSEWOOD, MD, MPH</p>

<p>While summertime often evokes images of leisure, Total Worker Health Team (TWH) Members have been busy navigating a programmatic evolution and preparing for a new fiscal year of activities. Top on the to-do list is to continue to build the scientific foundation for the TWH approach. We’ve got a number of efforts in progress.</p>

<p>
	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Casey Chosewood' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/chosewood3n3.jpg'/>First, we look forward with great anticipation to the impending release of the new Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) for the NIOSH Centers of Excellence for Total Worker Health. Release of this FOA will provide a fresh opportunity to again find the most promising researchers who are advancing the science of TWH. Second, after several years of groundwork, preparations are finally underway for a 2-day National Institutes of Health Pathways to Prevention workshop, which will evaluate the current scientific knowledge on integrated approaches and plot the direction for future research. The meeting, scheduled for December 9-10, will be open to the public. Third, we have been reviewing and discussing all of the valuable stakeholder input we received last autumn on the proposed draft National Total Worker Health Agenda. This helpful input has already led to an expansion of our Issues Relevant to Total Worker Health list to better reflect the <a href="../../enews/enewsV12N12.html">changing nature of work in the 21<sup>st</sup> century and the changing needs of today’s workforce</a>. Compensation and benefits, organization of work, and workplace violence prevention, are examples of issues that have always been of interest and now have become even more pressing.</p>

                    </div>
                				                                                    					            						<div class='syndicate'>

	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Anita Schill' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/anitaschill3n3.jpg'/>We are also excited to report that on June 24 we convened our Fifth Annual National Expert Colloquium on TWH with unprecedented representation by our labor partners. This Colloquium provided a most valuable opportunity to listen and receive input from those who are closest to workers. We heard firsthand what they view as the most important challenges facing today’s workers and we are in the process of considering options to be more responsive.</p>

<p>In this issue we are excited to bring you a <a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#2">TWH Exclusive</a> commentary on sedentary work by dr. mc schraefel. Six new Affiliates have joined us, read more in <a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#4">News from Partners</a>. Plus, we are excited to tell you about two separate trainings for nurses: one on job stress, the other on shift work and fatigue. And wait, there’s more: five new peer-reviewed publications by our NIOSH-funded Centers of Excellence!</p>

<p>This is an exciting time to be engaged with Total Worker Health—we are constantly seeking to advance TWH research and practice based on the best scientific evidence, all while staying committed to being responsive to you, our stakeholders and partners. As always, we welcome you to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:twh@cdc.gov">twh@cdc.gov</a>. We thrive on your input and suggestions. As always, we wish you and your loved ones an abundance of health and well-being —in the fullness of your life —on and off the job.</p>

<p>As always, we hope this newsletter inspires you to become a Total Worker Health advocate.

<p>Apple CEO Tim Cook recently made a big splash by saying that “a lot of doctors believe sitting is the new cancer.” Mr. Cook was not specific in citing sources for his statement, but presumably he was referring to studies that have found increased health risks from sedentary behavior that are analogous to cancer in prevalence and cost. For instance, in 2011, Dunstan et al.<sup><a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#refs">1</a></sup> called the cardiovascular effects of sedentarism and its related risks ‘the new smoking.’</p>

<p>So yes, sedentarism is harmful. Indeed, most of us spend time using our bodies solely to move our brains from one chair to another. We move from a car or train to work; from a chair at work to a restaurant or movie theater; and from there to home, where we hang around watching sports, playing a video game, or working online. We sit a lot—on average, 10 largely uninterrupted hours a day. Although I’m personally in favor of burning the chair<sup><a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#refs">2</a></sup> in favor of movement (which can inspire us to be more creative), we don’t have to be that extreme. Recent work on physiology strongly suggests that we simply need to get more standing throughout our days than sitting to reset our systems. Moving frequently in fact is more effective than sitting all day, then going to the gym to work out for an hour, and then sitting again in the evening. An analogy can be made to chain smoking. If you stop smoking for just an hour, it will not mitigate the cumulative effects of the 7 hours before and the 7 after. We need to move throughout our day, including while we are at work.</p>

<p>Once we decide to reduce sitting at work, how do we make it happen? How do we support more movement during the work day? Apple CEO Tim Cook’s suggestion is the Apple watch; it will detect when you’ve not been moving and vibrate or ring to shake you into awareness. Move where, though? For how long and to do what? The market is flooded with wearable technology that claims to promote health. Technology alone is not the answer. It can be used in conjunction with an environment that facilitates movement. We need an active movement culture in the workplace, utilizing sit-stand desks and walks to the printer.</p>

<p><strong>There’s NOT an App for It</strong><br />
It’s not hard to understand why individual technology on its own is not going to solve a systemic problem like sedentarism. In a recent pilot study with Ogilvy Labs of Ogilvy Maher, UK, my colleagues and I looked at prompts to encourage standing with a group of participants interested in how they could improve their creativity—without trying to improve it. More movement is part of that process. Feedback we received is that these wonderfully keen people were still concerned about bothering office-mates by getting up from their desk and starting to do squats or lunges. Similarly, they were concerned about going away from their desks, lest they be perceived as slacking off or missing in action. Likewise, at meetings where there are small groups and only chairs, they reported it felt hard to be the odd person out by standing up. We explored mechanisms for engaging with colleagues and management to make taking “movement snacks” understood, accepted, and more viral. <strong>Big takeaway here: sharing with people what you’re planning, and looking for support and understanding, can help reduce the perceived risk of trying something new.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/">Cochrane Collaboration</a> recently released a <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD010912/OCCHEALTH_workplace-interventions-for-reducing-sitting-time-at-work">Cochrane Review</a> (a systematic review that synthesizes the results of multiple studies to determine the best ways to protect workers against health risks and dangers in the workplace), on interventions to reduce sitting at work.<sup><a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#refs">3</a></sup> The main conclusion was this: we don’t have enough good data yet. According to Cochrane, available research on the topic is “low quality” in terms of protocols for study. It recommends better ways to look at this effect in the workplace and notes that two studies are under way to do just that. Despite the lack of high-grade studies, the significance of sedentarism as a health problem is unequivocal. Sedentarism must be addressed systemically rather than at the individual level if we are to have a meaningful impact on reversing its effects.</p>

<p>From the research available, indicators suggest more benefit than harm from using sit-stand desks as interventions. My colleagues and I have looked at the effects of standing on cognitive performance, and the only task we found that was done significantly better sitting down was multitasking,<sup><a href="twhnewsv4n2.html#refs">4</a></sup> which other considerable research shows we’re bad at anyway.</p>

<p>Among the studies the Cochrane Review considered were environmental interventions, such as using sit-stand desks and encouraging brisk walking for breaks and walking to see colleagues rather than emailing. For sit-stand desks, promising findings include reductions in musculoskeletal pain and in sick time off of work. When researchers added information and counseling to the introduction of sit-stand desks, uptake was greater. This approach reduced sitting time per 8-hour workday by 23.5%. In addition, there was a 9.7% decrease in duration of sitting episodes lasting at least 30 minutes, and at follow-up participants reported feeling more productive when using these interventions.</p>

<p>Technology on its own is not a solution to sedentarism at work. Rather, we need environments that are conducive to movement, both physically and culturally. From related research, we know that more active people are cognitively sharper, deal better with stress, and report fewer days of sick time. If we want to increase the positive effects (on employee engagement, vigor, and sick time used) that even small-scale movement interventions seem to achieve, we may want to consider rethinking our work. Incorporating more movement as part of work is to our industrial and social benefit. And while we’re thinking about that, we may also want to think about how to support the rest of the brain–body connection, in terms of work practices around food, sleep, engagement with others, and learning and practicing new skills— but I leave that for another time. Meanwhile, time to go walk about. Join me?</p>

<h2><a id="6" name="6"> </a>New Publications and Resources</h2>

<h4>Five New Publications from Centers of Excellence for Total Worker Health</h4>

<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajim.22392/abstract">Understanding the hospital sharps injury reporting pathway</a><br />
In this study from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being, authors compared patient care workers’ survey responses regarding sharps injuries and number of injuries that were recorded in the Occupational Health Services (OHS) Database. Perceived safety practices on hospital units were positively associated with respondents’ saying they reported sharps injuries, but not with whether reported injuries appeared in the OHS data. The authors suggest that simpler, more direct reporting mechanisms should be considered and that facilities need to understand why reported injuries are not recorded in OHS data.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25994975">Supervisors’ support for nurses’ meal breaks and mental health</a><br />
Hurtado et al., also of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, examined the association between frequency of meal breaks and psychological distress among nurses, focusing on supervisors’ support for meal breaks. The authors found that nurses on units with more supportive supervisors more frequently took meal breaks and, moreover, more frequently had lower average levels of psychological distress. Interventions to address supervisors’ support for staff meal breaks might be useful to promote the mental health of their staff.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25850157">Musculoskeletal disorder symptoms in correction officers: Why do they increase rapidly with job tenure?</a><br />
This past March, investigators at the Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace (CPH-NEW) described the relationship between job tenure and musculoskeletal disorders in correction officers. The study findings help build the evidence base for interventions to improve work organization and job design for corrections officers, particularly with regard to job stress.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/aa/915359/">Health behaviors and overweight in nursing home employees: Contribution of workplace stressors and implications for worksite health promotion</a><br />
Also by investigators at CPH-NEW and partners, this report describes a study of the relationship between a broad range of workplace stressors and obesity, cigarette smoking, and physical inactivity. Among the findings were that young workers are disproportionately impacted by working conditions and that strenuous physical work and psychosocial strain are disproportionately common among low-wage workers.</p>

<p><a href="http://hpp.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/02/24/1524839915573945.abstract">Assessing organizational readiness for a participatory occupational health/health promotion intervention in skilled nursing facilities</a><br />
CPH-NEW researchers affiliated with the University of Massachusetts Lowell examined the organizational readiness of five nursing facilities for a participatory occupational health and health promotion intervention. The selection criteria were then evaluated, with implications for effectiveness and sustainability of interventions.</p>
