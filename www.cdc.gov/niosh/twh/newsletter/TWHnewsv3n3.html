<p>
	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Casey Chosewood' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/chosewood3n3.jpg'/>We are very excited to announce two items that are “hot off the press.” First, registration is now OPEN for the 1<sup>st</sup> International Symposium to Advance total worker health<sup>TM</sup>! You are invited to join more than 500 scientists and practitioners from around the world on October 6-8, 2014 at the beautiful campus of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD to learn about the latest science and practice on integrating health protection and health promotion. Be inspired by the Opening Session with renowned national and international leaders and three Plenary Sessions that explore new frontiers in worker health, safety, and well-being. Learn from leading experts in over thirty-six 75-minute, scientific and practice sessions demonstrating current research and workplace approaches to enhance organizational cultures of safety, health and well-being. Provide invaluable input that will help shape the very first agenda for the Nation on Total Worker Health in two town hall forums. Space will be limited, so reserve your spot today! To see the full agenda and register, visit <a id="anch_56" href="http://www.eagleson.org/totalworkerhealth">www.eagleson.org/totalworkerhealth</a>.</p>

<p>
	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Anita Schill' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/anitaschill3n3.jpg'/>Second, today marks the launch of a new suite of web-based tools, called <a id="anch_58" href="../letsgetstarted.html"><em>Total Worker Health: Let’s Get Started! A Practitioner’s Guide</em></a><em>. </em>These tools are designed for decision-makers and practitioners who understand the value of integrating health protection and health promotion and simply want to get started. <em>Let’s Get Started</em> is intended to serve as a gateway to state-of-the-art guidelines and tools for employers and others, enabling them to use an integrated approach as they create and enhance an organizational culture of safety and health. For highlights, check out <a id="anch_59" href="TWHnewsv3n3.html#6">New Initiatives and Resources</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, we invite you to explore this issue of <em>TWH in Action!</em> to find other news, resources, and updates. Here’s a glimpse of what you’ll find:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a id="anch_60" href="TWHnewsv3n3.html#9">Total Worker Health Exclusive</a>,</em>, read how the NIOSH Office for TWH, Centers of Excellence, and others are thinking ahead to address the future training and professional development needs to best integrate health protection and health promotion policies and programs for the workers of tomorrow.</li>

<h2>TOTAL WORKER HEALTH<sup>&reg;</sup> Exclusive</h2>

<h4>Building Professional Development for Total Worker Health</h4>

<p>ADELE CHILDRESS, PhD, MSPH, NIOSH OFFICE FOR TOTAL WORKER HEALTH</p>

<p>Over the past 40 years, NIOSH and other organizations, such as the <a id="anch_68" href="http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/transf_scaling_hpet/en/index.html">World Health Organization</a> and the <a id="anch_70" href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2000/Safe-Work-in-the-21st-Century-Education-and-Training-Needs-for-the-Next-Decades-Occupational-Safety-and-Health-Personne">Institute of Medicine</a> have examined issues related to workforce development for professionals in occupational safety and health protection and health promotion. They have found a strong need in almost all health care disciplines to develop competent professionals with the skills and abilities to more comprehensively improve global and workplace health and well-being. This finding demonstrates an urgent, essential need to develop and support a more integrated approach to training and professional development.</p>

<p>This leads to the question: What skills and training are required to prepare professionals to address the complex challenges affecting the modern workplace? In a NIOSH-sponsored meeting of the extramurally funded Centers, for instance, many expressed that the current workforce training needs are in occupational health psychology. Dr. Martin Cherniack, co-director of the Center for Promotion of Health in the New England Workforce, cited an emerging need for revised curricula for physicians and nurses that reflect shifts in health care policy, as well as the importance of including occupational health in the training of environmental health and safety professionals.</p>

<p>The NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health is also examining this question and invites your input.</p>

<h4>Current efforts by NIOSH, Centers of Excellence, and Others</h4>

<p>NIOSH continues to support its mandate to protect workers’ safety and health through the education and training of professionals by means of workforce development programs. These programs occur extramurally, through research and training grants for academic institutions to establish <a id="anch_72" href="../../oep/multicenters.html">multidisciplinary centers</a>. Building upon this foundation of protecting worker safety and health and recognizing the gap in curriculum integration, the Office for TWH has begun defining key stakeholders for this issue and exploring training needs to equip health professionals to address issues related to the total worker health of employees and organizations. The Office for TWH is considering the cultural and economic nuances, differing objectives and organizational strategies, and complex interactions between the various stakeholders. The Office for TWH will be studying the implications of these factors for current and future practitioners of occupational safety and health, worksite health promotion, medicine, nursing, psychology, human resources and productivity management, and others.</p>

<p>Currently, NIOSH and the Centers of Excellence are providing various professional development opportunities. In February, NIOSH launched a <a id="anch_73" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/TWH/webinar.html">Total Worker Health Webinar Series</a> offering free continuing education credits (i.e., CEU, CNE, CME, and CHES) and providing the latest research and case studies on the integration of health protection and health promotion. The Harvard School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-being is offering its third course in January 2015, entitled <a id="anch_74" href="https://ecpe.sph.harvard.edu/programs.cfm?CSID=WHW0115">“Work, Health, and Well-being: Integrating Wellness and Occupational Health and Safety in the Workplace.”</a> In October at the 1<sup>st</sup> International Symposium to Advance Total Worker Health, <a id="anch_76" href="http://www.eagleson.org/conferences/total-worker-health/conference-workshops">Pre and Post Conference Workshops</a> will offer state of the art strategies and implementation tools for creating enhanced cultures of safety and health.</p>

<p>Outside of NIOSH, leading academic institutions are also making strides in developing trainings and curricula that integrate health protection and health promotion. For instance, this fall, Western Kentucky University (highlighted in this issue’s <a id="anch_78" href="TWHnewsv3n3.html#2">Promising Practices</a>) will be implementing a Master of Science and advanced certificate program that features an integrated curriculum with both occupational safety and health promotion components. The Colorado School of Public Health (CSPH) now offers two graduate-level courses relevant to Total Worker Health, including one titled “<a id="anch_79" href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/departments/EnvironmentalOccupationalHealth/academics/Pages/Courses.aspx">Health Protection and Health Promotion in the Workplace</a>,” and another interdisciplinary course structured around NIOSH Total Worker Health principles that allows students to conduct onsite workplace assessments of community organizations’ health protection and health promotion programs.</p>

<p>To address the current <em>total worker health</em> knowledge gaps in workplaces, CSPH’s Center for Worker Health &#38; Environment runs <a id="anch_81" href="https://www.healthlinkscolorado.org/">Health Links<sup>TM </sup>Colorado</a>, a community-based program that certifies, funds, and trains small businesses on evidence-based practices to implement sustainable workplace health and safety programs. Dr. Lee Newman of CSPH noted, “In the short run, we need to focus on the retraining of those individuals who are already engaging workers in health, safety, or both. The demand is high and the supply of trained professionals low. For the long term, we need to train future leaders in the field of TWH, who can innovate, conduct research, evaluate, and effectively disseminate knowledge, so that the field grows in credibility.”</p>

<h4>Continue the conversation</h4>

<p>As the concept and rationale for a Total Worker Health approach continues to evolve, the question remaining will be how to translate those findings into practice—particularly, how to build them into long-term educational plans to inform the development of the next generation of professionals in this field. This will entail more communication and collaboration across professions, educational and training programs, and health care systems.</p>

<p>Are you interested in contributing to the conversation on workforce development in person? The Office for TWH warmly welcomes you to join us at the forthcoming<a id="anch_83" href="http://www.eagleson.org/conferences/total-worker-health"> 1<sup>st</sup> International Symposium to Advance Total Worker Health</a>, on October 6 - 8.

<p>Recognizing the emerging need for a workforce that can understand the potential synergy between safety, injury prevention, and wellness efforts, Western Kentucky University (WKU) has begun offering educational programs that encourage students to integrate health promotion into occupational safety and vice versa.</p>

<p>In fall 2014, WKU will offer a Master of Science in Environmental and Occupational Health Science, with both worksite wellness and safety components. In addition, an advanced certificate in worksite health promotion will be available that includes training on critical issues in health and safety.</p>

<p>Cecilia Watkins, who teaches worksite health promotion at WKU, has been one of the lead figures pushing for integration in the WKU curriculum. Each year she takes her students on a field trip to Logan Aluminum, a local business, but this year she brought along occupational safety and health students as well. Both sets of students attended presentations by Logan’s safety and wellness representatives.</p>

<p>In another example, students in Graduate Worksite Health Promotion are working collaboratively to develop a program integrating health protection and health promotion, using Logan as a case study. A key instructional resource in this elective has been <a id="anch_90" href="http://www.dir.ca.gov/chswc/WOSHTEP/Publications/WOSHTEP_TheWholeWorker.pdf"><em>The Whole Worker: Guidelines for Integrating Occupational Health and Safety with Workplace Wellness Programs</em></a>, one of the resources featured on our <a id="anch_92" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/reports.html">Guidelines for Implementing TWH Programs webpage.</a> For more information on developments related to integrated educational offerings at WKU, visit <a id="anch_93" href="http://www.wku.edu/online/worksitehealth">http://www.wku.edu/online/worksitehealth</a> or email <a id="anch_95" href="mailto:cecilia.watkins@wku.edu">cecilia.watkins@wku.edu</a>.</p>

<p>Rethinking the educational framework is only one important piece of current efforts toward integration in Kentucky. The Kentucky Department for Public Health Worksite Wellness Program and the Kentucky Injury Prevention and Research Center (KIPRC) at the University of Kentucky are bringing together the lead agencies and thinkers in the state for worksite wellness, injury prevention, and occupational safety and health, as well as strong linkages with small business. While these programs have long been strong in their own right, they are now taking bold, new steps to integrate health protection and health promotion for even better outcomes.</p>

<p>Psychosocial and physical workplace exposures can affect workers in many different ways. Two new scientific reports from the Harvard Center for Work, Health, and Well-being highlight the workplace exposures and experiences of patient care and construction workers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Caban-Martinez AJ, Lowe KA, Herrick R, Kenwood C, Gagne JJ, Becker JF, Schneider SP, Dennerlein JT, Sorensen G [2014]. <a id="anch_128" href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24760608">Construction workers working in musculoskeletal pain and engaging in leisure-time physical activity: findings from a mixed-methods pilot study</a>. Am J Ind Med <em>57</em>(7):819–825.

<h4>University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence (HWCE)</h4>

<p>As health care and health insurance costs increase sharply, employers and employees struggle to maintain quality of health care coverage and benefits. To address the need for baseline, evidence-based data on the statewide workforce, the <a id="anch_130" href="http://www.hwce.org/">University of Iowa Healthier Workforce Center for Excellence</a> developed the Real Iowan Research Initiative (RIRI) with a goal of providing statewide employment sector estimates of health status, prevention, and productivity measures. A statewide survey of 1,602 Iowans included items from the CDC Quality-of-Life (QoL) and BRFSS prevention behavior questionnaires and was used to assess employee well-being. QoL and prevention behavior measures were related to absenteeism and presenteeism scores derived from the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ). Key findings include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having higher QoL measures and having more prevention behaviors are strongly associated with lower absenteeism and lower presenteeism scores</li>

<li>Employment status matters: the unemployed had poorer QoL scores and prevention behaviors</li>

<li>QoL scores and prevention behaviors were much better for the self-employed than for those who were organizationally employed</li>
</ul>

<p>The full article, <em>Employment Status Matters—A Statewide Survey of Quality-of-Life, Prevention Behaviors, and Absenteeism and Presenteeism, </em>was published on July 7 in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. A commentary on this article by Martin Sepulveda, IBM Fellow and Vice President of Integrated Health Services for the IBM Corporation, is included in the issue.</p>

<h4>New Publications Suggest using an Integrated Approach to Address Chronic Health Conditions at Work</h4>

<p><strong>Cancer Prevention and Worksite Health Promotion: Time to Join Forces, Preventing Chronic Disease, Vol. 11</strong></p>

<p>
	<img class="pull-right margin-left-ten" alt='	Addressing cardiovascular disease through Total Worker Health' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/images/coronary.png'/>Recently published in <em><a id="anch_149" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2014/14_0127.htm">Preventing Chronic Disease</a>,</em> “Cancer Prevention and Worksite Health Promotion: Time to Join Forces,” is an essay that indicates a multifaceted approach to cancer prevention in the workplace is timely and needed. In this essay, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NIOSH experts, including Drs. Casey Chosewood and Anita Schill and LCDR Heidi Hudson, share existing CDC resources that can be leveraged to expand the scope of workplace initiatives to address additional cancer risk factors and disparities. Included is an integrated approach to health protection and health promotion and linkages with community-based resources. Combined these resources can also provide ideas for new efforts to advance primary cancer prevention among working adults.</p>

<p>Drs. Dan Ganster and Leslie Hammer will discuss psychosocial stress at work and interventional approaches for alleviating it. Dan will briefly introduce the literature on psychosocial stress and well-being, focusing on key definitions and the working conditions implicated in worker mental and physical health. Then, he will discuss practical interventions that focus on removing or reducing stressors in the workplace. Using several examples of intervention studies, he will discuss key elements to incorporate when designing workplace interventions. He will also outline simple approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of such interventions.</p>

<p>Leslie will discuss more specifically the concept of work-life stress and its association with health, safety, well-being, and organizational outcomes. She will briefly review how comprehensive integrated solutions at both the occupational (health protection) and individual (health promotion) levels may be helpful in mitigating effects of work-life stress and improving health, consistent with the Total Worker Health<sup> </sup>approach. This presentation will review relationships between work-life stress and health to advance understanding of pathways between occupational and individual risk factors and health and safety outcomes.</p>
