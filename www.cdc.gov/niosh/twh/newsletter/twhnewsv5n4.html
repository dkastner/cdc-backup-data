<p>Season's Greetings! As we enjoy this holiday season with friends and family, we are reminded of the gift of a safe and healthful work environment. Because we're committed to providing practical guidance and resources to help organizations better implement TWH in their workplaces, we're excited to give you <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2017-112/?s_cid=3ni7d2newsletTWHFundamentals12202016"><em>Fundamentals of Total Worker Health</em><sup><em>®</em></sup><em> Approaches: Essential Elements for Advancing Worker Safety, Health and Well-being</em></a>. This new workbook brings a fresh perspective on high-quality workplace policies, programs, and practices that can create and sustain safer work and healthier workers. It’s ideal for folks ready to get started in their own workplaces. Learn more about the just-released document in the <a href="twhnewsv5n4.html#Total Worker Health Exclusive">Total Worker Health Exclusive</a>.</p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce two additions to the family of NIOSH Centers of Excellence for <em>Total Worker Health<sup>®</sup></em>! NIOSH will now fund six Centers of Excellence to further advance the overall safety, health, and well-being of the diverse population of workers in our nation. The Centers will accomplish this through innovative and multidisciplinary research, intervention development, outreach and education, and evaluation activities.</p>

<p>
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='	Centers of Excellence Map' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/centersofexcellencemap.jpg'/></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>The two new Centers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>University of Illinois-Chicago, Center for Healthy Work</li>

<li>University of Colorado, <a href="https://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/CHWE/Pages/TheCenter.aspx">Center for Health, Work &#38; Environment</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The four existing Centers successfully competed for funding renewal. These Centers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://centerforworkhealth.sph.harvard.edu/">Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, &#38; Well-being</a>,</li>

<li><a href="https://www.uml.edu/Research/centers/CPH-NEW/">Center for the Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace</a>,</li>

<li><a href="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/hwce/">Healthier Workforce Center of the Midwest</a>,</li>

<li><a href="http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/oregon-institute-occupational-health-sciences/oregon-healthy-workforce-center/index.cfm">Oregon Healthy Workforce Center</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please join us in welcoming our new Centers of Excellence and in our congratulations to all the Centers!</p>

<p>NIOSH works hard to bring the principles of total worker health to its own workforce through the HealthiestNIOSH program. It helps us keep our own workers safe and healthy.

<p>The Hierarchy of Controls Applied to NIOSH <em>Total Worker Health<sup>®</sup> </em>provides a conceptual model for prioritizing efforts to advance worker safety, health, and well-being. As in the traditional <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/default.html">Hierarchy of Controls</a>, controls and strategies are presented in descending order of anticipated effectiveness and protectiveness as suggested by the cascading arrows. The Hierarchy of Controls Applied to NIOSH <em>Total Worker Health </em>expands the traditional hierarchy from occupational safety and health to include controls and strategies that more broadly advance worker well-being. The Hierarchy of Controls Applied to NIOSH Total Worker Health is not meant to replace the traditional Hierarchy of Controls, but rather is a companion to this important occupational safety and health model. The Hierarchy of Controls Applied to NIOSH Total Worker Health serves to illustrate how Total Worker Health approaches emphasize organizational-level interventions to protect workers’ safety, health, and well-being. To apply this model:</p>

<ul type="square">
<li>Begin by eliminating workplace conditions that cause or contribute to worker illness and injury, or otherwise negatively impact well-being. This includes factors related to supervision throughout the management chain.</li>

<li>Second, replace unsafe, unhealthy working conditions or practices with safer, health-enhancing policies, programs, and management practices that improve the culture of safety and health in the workplace.</li>

<li>Next, redesign the work environment, where needed, for safety, health, and well-being. Remove impediments to well-being, enhance employer-sponsored benefits, and provide flexible work schedules.</li>

<li>Then, provide safety and health education and resources to enhance individual knowledge for all workers.</li>

<li>Lastly, encourage personal change for improvements to health, safety, and well-being. Assist workers with individual risks and challenges; provide support for healthier choice-making.</li>
</ul>

<p>Recently the NIOSH TWH program teamed up with the NIOSH Work Organization and Stress-Related Disorders Research Program and the NIOSH Economics Research Program to launch a new collaboration for the Institute – the Healthy Work Design and Well-being research cross-sector. The new cross-sector will fine-tune NIOSH efforts to design work, work environments, and management practices that promote worker safety, health, and well-being and hopes to inspire researchers to help answer some vital questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>How can we better design jobs to reduce worker stress, illness, and injury?</li>

<li>What economic drivers are influencing job design, worker safety, and health interventions?</li>

<li>What preventive interventions offer the most impact for the least cost?</li>

<li>How can work be crafted for greater health opportunities and organizational sustainability?</li>

<li>What are the critical links between work and well-being and how do we influence them?</li>
</ol>

<p>The group will help coordinate intramural and extramural research in this critical and challenging area.

<p><strong>Working Toward <em>Healthier Supervision</em> at NIOSH</strong></p>

<p><em>Constance Franklin, MPA, NIOSH Office for Total Worker Health</em></p>

<p>At NIOSH, protecting and promoting the safety, health, and well-being of diverse worker populations around the globe is a critical part of our work. But if we are really serious about this work, we strongly feel that we must apply the principles that we recommend to other organizations within our own Institute. Importantly, NIOSH workers get the opportunity to regularly provide feedback about their work environment and overall experiences through an annual survey given in all Federal workplaces. This showed that NIOSH employees wanted to see improvements in the way team leaders, managers, and supervisors fulfill their duties. A growing body of research shows that a worker’s direct-line supervisor has significant impact on an employee’s safety, morale, work experiences and performance, and even their overall health—both on and off the job.</p>

<p>In response, NIOSH’s internal TWH-focused program, HealthiestNIOSH, created a customized Healthier Supervision training for all workers in supervisory roles at NIOSH. The webinar-based, 90-minute training is a direct response to feedback captured through the annual Employee Viewpoint Survey conducted by the U.S. government Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p>Healthier Supervision training covers a variety of areas for team leaders and supervisors. The training sought to increase the awareness and skillset in areas the survey identified as challenging, including:</p>

<li>Strategies for Work-life integration</li>

<li>Healthier performance management skills</li>

<li>Managing a diverse workforce</li>

<li>Assisting workers with disability, chronic illness</li>

<li>Optimizing flexibility</li>

<li>Improving the environment for increasing employee engagement</li>

<li>Improving communication skills</li>

<li>Better ways to use rewards and recognition</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The NIOSH Focus on Safe, Healthy Workers</strong></p>

<p>NIOSH’s Director, Dr. John Howard, encouraged supervisors to participate in the new training, which met a part of the annual mandatory training for all supervisors. “NIOSH is committed to optimizing the safety, health, and well-being of our workforce and to making our work environment as healthy and supportive as it can be for all members of our NIOSH family…part of our individual responsibility to this effort is to continue to invest time in improving our skills as team leaders, supervisors, or managers,” said Dr. Howard. To date, over 60% of NIOSH team leaders, managers, and supervisors have taken the Healthier Supervision training.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the training, NIOSH supervisors were reminded that quality leadership starts with attention to important growth and developmental issues within their own lives. They were charged with the following suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get to know yourself better, identify your strengths and play them up while working on your weaker skills</li>

<li>Actively communicate every day with your colleagues and teams</li>

<li>Work on transparency; share as much as you can as often as you can</li>

<li>Set clear expectations of your team members, check in often, and be willing to reset</li>

<li>Intervene early when problems or team member challenges or issues arise</li>

<li>Recognize and reward your team members every day</li>

<li>Attend to work-life-family issues, both your own and your team members'</li>

<li>Learn new things; enhance your own leadership skills regularly and support your team in continuous learning and development</li>

<li>Get help when you need it from colleagues or experts</li>
</ul>

<p>HealthiestNIOSH encourages you to "Be the supervisor you would want to have!"</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/CHWE/Pages/TheCenter.aspx">Center for Health, Work &#38; Environment</a></h4>

<p>The Center for Health, Work &#38; Environment is based at the Colorado School of Public Health at CU Anschutz. The Center builds on the successful <a href="https://www.healthlinkscertified.org/community/colorado/news-and-events">Health Links</a> initiative, which is now reaching hundreds of Colorado businesses in its mission to bring best practices for worksite well-being and safety from conception to practical use.</p>

<p>Total Worker Health is the concept that the workplace is itself a medium within which overall health interventions should take place, expanding the current norm in which businesses focus efforts on safety. Keeping safe on the job remains a priority, but Total Worker Health also recognizes that workplace health can be addressed. The Center will focus on particular Colorado and regional concerns in small- and medium size businesses including stress, work-related injuries and fatalities, aging workers and the needs of workers with chronic illnesses.</p>

<p>The Center will work with business and worker groups to implement TWH programs. Businesses will be able to launch health programs and gain practical information and tools to do it in an effective, sustainable way. The new Center will, in turn, learn from small businesses on how to build on their successes.</p>

<p>“This center is using a business approach – not an academic one,” Lee Newman, MD, Director of the Center for Health, Work &#38; Environment. “It’s taking a more holistic approach to worker health and worker safety and, in turn productivity.” To learn more about the Center for Health, Work &#38; Environment, please visit the Center’s <a href="http://www.ucdenver.edu/academics/colleges/PublicHealth/research/centers/CHWE/Pages/TheCenter.aspx">website</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/hwcmw/">Healthier Workforce Center of the Midwest (HWCMW)</a></h4>

<p>Employers in the Midwest struggling with workplace health and safety issues now have a stronger ally in their efforts to promote a safer and healthier workforce. Workers in Iowa and neighboring states experience more work-related injuries and illnesses than in other parts of the U.S., according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The region also has higher rates of unhealthy behaviors such as heavy alcohol consumption and obesity than other areas of the country, with high rates of occupational fatalities. Recognizing the critical needs in the region, particularly among small employers, the University of Iowa is pleased to announce the expansion and launch of the Healthier Workforce Center of the Midwest, in partnership with Washington University in St. Louis and the Nebraska Safety Council, to provide increased attention to these issues.</p>

<p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health has funded the Healthier Workforce Center at the University of Iowa since 2006 to address TWH. Center Director Diane Rohlman, PhD, believes this expanded effort will better serve regional needs. “Our partnerships in Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas will help us leverage even more practical and research expertise to help businesses succeed and to maximize the safety and health of our workers,” said Rohlman.

<h4>University of Illinois-Chicago Center for Healthy Work</h4>

<p>The newly funded University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Center for Healthy Work seeks to turn unhealthy work into healthy work by focusing on the health impacts of precarious jobs. A growing number of working adults are employed in these temporary, contract, and involuntary part-time jobs which may offer no control over dangerous working conditions, low wages, few or no benefits, long hours, no opportunities for advancement, and no assurance of long-term employment. <a href="https://krueger.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/akrueger/files/katz_krueger_cws_-_march_29_20165.pdf">Research</a> by economists Katz and Krueger indicate that the percentage of workers employed in these “alternative work arrangements” increased from 10% of the workforce in 2005 to 16% in 2015.</p>

<p>Shifting the social norm of work—that everyone deserves and has the right to a healthy job—requires a wide range of actions at multiple social and economic levels. The Center will focus first on scanning and mapping the nature and structure of precarious jobs in Chicago, building on long-term collaborations with organizations, professionals, and community partners. Additionally, the Center will partner with local, regional, and national organizations to craft and implement policies and programs aimed at turning unhealthy into healthy work.</p>

<p>The Center for Healthy Work under Director Lisa Brosseau, ScD, MS hopes to join and empower communities undertaking long-term protection efforts at the local, state, regional, and national levels to make healthy work the norm rather than the exception.</p>

Chan School of Public Health Center for Work, Health, and Well-Being presents a conceptual model to guide research and inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of integrated Total Worker Health approaches. The model is based on the principle that the conditions of work may determine outcomes important to organizations (such as absence and turnover), as well as individual safety and health outcomes and behaviors.</li>
