	<img class="pull-left margin-right-ten" alt='	Casey Chosewood' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/newsletter/images/chosewood3n3.jpg'/>In May, the 10th International Conference on Occupational Stress and Health elevated the significance that work and health cannot be separated. Underscoring an emerging research area and priority for NIOSH, the conference was themed <a id="anch_56" href="http://www.apa.org/wsh/index.aspx">Work Stress and Health 2013: Protecting and Promoting Total Worker Health<sup>&reg;</sup></a>. Nearly 800 professionals from 39 countries, representing academia, labor, and industry participated in the biennial event sponsored by NIOSH and partners at the American Psychological Association and the Society of Occupational Health Psychology.</p>

<p>Of special interest, we learned that we were not alone in our commitment to integrate health protection with health promotion. We were inspired by the numerous papers and posters from around the world that presented on the benefits and design of integrated prevention practices that promote overall worker well-being. We are proud to share this commitment at a critical point in a new area of research and practice in workplace safety and health. As the concept of Total Worker Health continues to get wider attention, we look forward to future collaborations with our colleagues. To learn more about WSH2013, read the Director’s Desk in the August 2013 issue of NIOSH eNews: <a id="anch_58" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/enews/enewsV11N4.html#director">/niosh/enews/enewsV11N4.html#director</a></p>

<h2>Total Worker Health<sup>&reg;</sup> Exclusive</h2>

<h3>Privacy and Security of Employees’ Health Data in the Era of Electronic Health Records</h3>

<p><em>BY:</em>KERRY SOUZA, SCD, MPH; CAPT MARGARET S. FILIOS, SM, BSN; AND EILEEN STOREY, MD, MPH</p>

<p>Big Data, Little Data, Open Data – a burgeoning interest in data is evident, perhaps nowhere more so than in public health and healthcare. Nationally, several major ‘data revolutions’ are underway, including a transition to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to maintain and share longitudinal patient health data, and the increasing use of data to measure the performance of healthcare and public health programs. Both trends are relevant to Total Worker Health: data are being used in new and innovative ways to measure employee health status and increasingly, occupational health data are being exchanged electronically.</p>

<p>As employers, labor, public health and other stakeholders work together to integrate health protection and health promotion in the workplace, the amount of employee health data being generated, collected and electronically exchanged will only increase. Have you ever wondered what happens to employee wellness data collected by employers or a third party? Are these data treated as ‘confidential?’ Who has access to the data? When an employer has both voluntary wellness and required screening programs for employees, how should the data be maintained to prevent accidental disclosure of the voluntary information? These and other questions emerge when new employee health programs are put in place and/or paper records are replaced by electronic systems.</p>

<p>How to provide protection for personal health data is an important question. In 2000, the HIPAA Privacy Rule set new expectations for handling health data, but health data collected by employers may not be covered by the Privacy Rule, which pertains to “covered entities” who bill for clinical services. In some cases, provisions of Workers’ Compensation Laws or the American with Disabilities Act may govern handling of employees’ health data. EHRs enable both unprecedented exchange and secondary (e.g., research) use of health data, calling for a renewed analysis of the regulations and policies that protect those data. EHRs can also be part of the solution. Health information technology offers tools that can be employed to control access to employee’s personal health information. Best practices for the use of these tools in supporting TWH will be valuable to all stakeholders.</p>

<p>The NIOSH Electronic Health Records Working Group began exploring these issues and others at a June workshop on “Ethical and Privacy Challenges: Managing Information in Electronic Health Records in the Context of Occupational Health.” Representatives from Federal and state government; healthcare organizations and provider groups; the insurance industry; organized labor; and, the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) participated. The ONC provided observations based on their experience addressing privacy and security challenges and opportunities encountered in the transition to EHRs.</p>

<p>Workshop proceedings and other outputs will help stakeholders identify opportunities to protect employee health data while providing integrated healthcare to workers. The NIOSH EHR Working Group and the TWH Team will work together with our partners and stakeholders to address privacy and security issues in this new landscape of data use.

<p>In 2009, Dartmouth-Hitchcock, an academic medical center in New Hampshire with over 8,000 employees, needed to make a change. Covering over 16,000 in its health plans, health care costs were almost 10% of the medical center’s budget and rising faster than health care inflation rates each year. While collaborative, the employee health and safety departments were in different silos and recognized there were opportunities to create synergies with each other’s initiatives. Another challenge was that the medical center had different locations and clinic sites.</p>

<p>The leadership of Dartmouth-Hitchcock decided that it could do better and would aim to have the healthiest workforce possible—a goal which the medical center adopted as the corporate vision to ensure sustainability and engagement at every level. As a result, the strategic priority, Live Well/Work Well (LWWW), was created with a mission to create a culture of health, safety, and well-being.</p>

<h4>Integrating Safety and Health</h4>

<p>A foundational principle of LWWW is that the health of employees is facilitated by integration of health protection with health promotion. LWWW developed electronic reporting of injuries (EROI), which assures timely medical care by providing immediate notification to employer stakeholders such as occupational medicine, safety, human resources, and work ability programs. LWWW also identified high-risk work units using aggregate EROI data and assessed their need for health promotion and protection interventions. The work units were evaluated by wellness and performance indicators, including Health Risk Appraisal (HRA) participation, patient satisfaction, culture of health, and nursing quality.</p>

<h4>Comprehensive Assessments</h4>

<p>If a work unit meets criteria for an intervention, a Safety Wellness Action Team (SWAT) is to be formed, a new initiative now being piloted by LWWW. Then the Team will conduct an initial, open-ended safety and socio-environmental assessment of work organization, leadership, leadership support for culture of health, physical hazards, indoor air quality, ergonomics, whole worker health, nutritional environment, and opportunities for physical activity at work. The local Partners in Health, Environment, Wellness, and Safety (PHEWS) committee, comprised of stakeholder representatives from the work unit, will review and discuss the results. If needed, the PHEWS committee will help other employees in the work unit participate in a self-scored, psychosocial and personal health surveys looking at issues such as burn out, depression and anxiety, perceived stress, and physical well-being.</p>

<h4>Individual and Organizational Interventions</h4>

<p>On an individual level, employees use the self-scored surveys, which are not turned in, to understand the resources available to them. Services include employee assistance and behavioral health; work ability programs; and primary care disease management. At the group level, the PHEWS Committee identifies resources that would be helpful to the work unit as a whole. For example, administrative support staff may have limited opportunities for physical activity, so a health coaching intervention may be provided for the entire group. Integrated SWAT interventions include supervisor training, team and resiliency building, chaplaincy, lifestyle coaching, benefits design, and environmental supports, such as access to healthier foods or changes to work schedules, and policy changes.</p>

<h4>Metrics for Whole Worker Health</h4>

<p>The integrated approach of LWWW applies to not only the needs assessment and interventions, but also the measurement of employee safety, health, and well-being. LWWW uses multiple metrics for its program evaluation. Illustrated in figure 1, metrics are included for occupational safety and health, health outcomes, business outcomes, work environment, program delivery and health risks. Aside from looking at the of data for the entire workforce population, as more time passes, the LWWW program intends to capture changes in the health outcomes and health care costs for cohorts of employees.</p>

<h4>Culture of Health, Safety, and Well-Being</h4>

<p>Dartmouth-Hitchcock continues to strive toward its vision of having the healthiest workforce possible. This year, the medical center incorporated into their performance management process the expectation that each employee has a responsibility for creating a healthier and safer work environment. The goals and expectations for each employee vary, ranging from a new employee’s simply gaining awareness of health and safety policies to a senior leader’s creation of effective policies that improve employee health.</p>

<p><strong>Health, safety, and well-being are integral to how Dartmouth-Hitchcock conducts its business. By operationalizing the value of health and safety, the medical center is working to drive the sustainability of its health system as well as its culture of health.</strong></p>

<h2>News from our Partners</h2>

<p><em>CDC partners with 104 employers for National Healthy Worksite Program: Initiative aims to prevent chronic disease, improve worker productivity, and control health costs</em></p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, through its partner Viridian Health Management, has identified 104 employers in eight counties across the nation to participate in the National Healthy Worksite Program, a new initiative aimed at reducing chronic disease and building a healthier, more productive U.S. workforce. The initiative primarily focuses on small and mid-sized employers.</p>

<p>CDC’s National Healthy Worksite Program is supported through the Affordable Care Act’s Prevention and Public Health Fund, and is designed to assist employers in building successful workplace wellness programs by implementing science-based disease prevention and wellness strategies to help reduce chronic diseases. All program and implementation support to participating employers will be provided by Viridian Health Management over a 12-month period. Viridian was selected as an implementation partner through a competitive process.</p>

<p>“Employers can increase productivity, cut health care costs and reduce the burden of heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes and other health problems in their workforce by making it easier for employees to be physically active, eat healthy foods, and not smoke,” said CDC Director, Tom Frieden, MD MPH. “Our National Healthy Worksite Program is providing valuable tools to help employers create effective workplace wellness programs that will benefit employees and their families, their community, and the nation as a whole.”</p>

<p>The eight participating communities are Buchanan County, Mo.; Harris County, Texas; Kern County, Calif.; Marion County, Ind.; Philadelphia County, Pa.; Pierce County, Wash.; Shelby County, Tenn.; and Somerset County, Maine.</p>

<p>The communities were selected because of their high rates of chronic diseases, smoking and physical inactivity. Also important in the community selection process was the availability of local resources to support a sustainable workplace health program, such as proximity to hospitals and existing community health promotion programs.</p>

<p>Employers in the eight communities were chosen based on interest and industry diversity. Each business will receive intensive support and expertise in developing a combination of interventions. Employers can choose which strategies to implement that support physical activity, good nutrition, and tobacco-use cessation. Examples of strategies include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Nutrition counseling/education, worksite farmer’s markets, menu labels on healthy foods in vending machines and cafeterias, access to healthy foods in cafeterias and vending machines, and weight management counseling.</li>

<li>Tobacco-cessation counseling (including quit lines and health plans) and tobacco-free campus policy.</li>

<li>Physical fitness and counseling, and walking clubs.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the program, a national evaluation will document best practices for successfully implementing workplace health programs in small worksites more broadly.</p>

<p>The Center for Promotion of Health in the New England Workplace (CPH-NEW), one of the NIOSH-funded Centers of Excellence to Promote a Healthier Workforce, plays an important role in the program as a subcontractor to Viridian. CPH-NEW is providing expertise and consultation to health coaches, employers, and workplace champions related to assessing job health and safety risks and interventions that integrate health promotion initiatives with safety initiatives.</p>

<p>The Center also manages a data center that conducts analyses of both company-level and the (de-identified) individual level, as well as builds upon existing work with its Research-to-Practice Toolkit to assess workplace risks and environmental resources in relation to ergonomics, job stress, and safety culture. Stay tuned for more information on these assessment tools the NIOSH Total Worker Health<sup>&reg;</sup> website.</p>

<h4>New National Health Interview Survey-Occupational Health Supplement Topic Page Provides Industry-Specific Data:</h4>

<p>Prevalence rates of work-related health conditions, work organization factors, and occupational psychosocial and physical/chemical exposures among U.S. workers by industry sector and occupational category are now available on the new <a id="anch_124" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/">National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement topic page</a>.</p>

<p>The data obtained from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) Occupational Health Supplement (OHS), are organized into National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) Sector Profiles. These profiles each contain charts and tables describing the prevalence of 14 outcomes. Results are categorized by industry and/or occupation subgroups within each sector profile. In addition to the sector profiles available on the NHIS-OHS topic page, summaries of the 14 health outcomes by demographic characteristics as well as broad industry and occupation categories are available.</p>

<p>Using these data, industry stakeholders can prioritize industry-wide interventions and employers can prioritize organization-level interventions to help ensure that the most pressing industry health concerns receive the appropriate attention. For example, 10% of non-smoking workers employed in all industry sectors combined reported <a id="anch_125" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/allnora/allfig15a.html">regular exposure to secondhand smoke at work</a>; but, the prevalence of exposure was more than twice that high among workers in the mining and oil and gas extraction, construction, and public safety sectors.</p>

<p>NIOSH will sponsor another NHIS-OHS in 2015, which will include most of the 2010 questions in order to monitor trends over time but may include a few new questions to address other high priority topics To read more and provide feedback, visit the <a id="anch_126" href="http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/06/24/nhis/">NIOSH Science Blog</a>.</p>

<h4>NIOSH Center for Workers’ Compensation Studies</h4>

<p>
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='	CWCS logo' src='https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/twh/images/cwcs.jpg'/>NIOSH recently created the Center for Workers’ Compensation Studies (CWCS) to use workers’ compensation (WC) data to prevent and reduce the severity of work-related injuries and illnesses.</p>

<p>The CWCS will coordinate research by NIOSH researchers and will work with external partners to maximize the use of their own WC data. The Center’s goals are to integrate WC data with other health-related data to understand the full economic impact of work-related injuries and illnesses and to identify evidence-based holistic prevention strategies. This includes health protection, health promotion, and disability management approaches. More information about the CWCS, including goals, current studies, and partnerships can be found at <a id="anch_127" href="../../topics/workerComp/CWCS/index.html">/niosh/topics/workerComp/CWCS/</a></p>
