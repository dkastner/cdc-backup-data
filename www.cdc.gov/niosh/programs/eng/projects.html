 <h3>Activities: NIOSH Research Projects</h3>
 <h4>Advanced Spray Dust Capture Principles for Mine Dust Control</h4>
 <p>The Mine Safety and Health Administration dust exposure data show that mining machine operators most frequently exceed the permissible exposure limit for respirable coal and/or silica dust. Laboratory and mine-site research work for improving the dust capture efficiency of coal mining machine mounted spray systems is planned, as well as field investigations into improving silica dust capture on rock cutting saws at dimension stone mills. This applied research would focus on integrating recently developed inline spray series scrubbers and fundamental spray design property knowledge to advance the dust capture efficiency of mining machine spray systems. This applied research is expected to advance coal and metal/nonmetal mining machine operator protection from respirable coal and/or silica dust exposure.</p>
 <p><em>Project contact:</em> John Organiscak<br />Pittsburgh Research Laboratory<br />(412) 386-6601<br /><em>Project period:</em> 2004-2009</p>
 <h4>Aircraft Cabin Airflows</h4>
 <p>This project will study the movement of air and particulates inside commercial aircraft cabins. The intent is to relate air flow patterns with the movement of potentially disease causing particles. We will use both computational fluid dynamics and experimental techniques to conduct this study. The research in this project will provide a better understanding of air movement within commercial aircraft cabins and how the potential for disease transmission could be impacted. Most studies that have been done previously have focused solely on traditional air quality parameters in aircraft cabins. However, documented cases of likely disease transmission during commercial flights have raised interest about this issue. Congress specifically mandated the Federal Aviation Administration to study this issue with CDC as a partner.</p>
 <p><em>Project contact:</em> Jennifer Topmiller<br />Division of Applied Research and Technology<br />(513) 533-8462<br /><em>Project period:</em> 2004-2007</p>
 <h4>Ambulance Crash Survivability Improvement Project</h4>
 <p>The objective of this NORA project is to reduce or eliminate vehicle crash-related injuries and fatalities to emergency service workers in ambulance patient compartments by increasing user acceptance of mobile occupant restraints tested during previous NIOSH Division of Safety Research research, improving the layout of the patient compartment, and improving the overall structural integrity of the patient compartment and equipment mounting hardware. A human factors evaluation will be used to evaluate impediments to occupant restraint use.

 <h4>Automobile Ultrafine Intervention</h4>
 <p>Ultrafine particles are generated in a variety of processes, including furnace and internal combustion engine operations, and metal processing such as welding, cutting, and spraying. Many of the processes generate toxic ultrafine metals such as manganese, lead, magnesium, zinc, cadmium, etc. Automotive production plants use these metals, involving many of these processes. In recent years, U.S. auto manufacturers and the United Auto Workers have become concerned about exposure to ultrafine particles. Worker exposures to these particles often go unrecognized because traditional industrial hygiene air sampling methods focus on mass rather than number. In this project, we will develop recommendations for control of ultrafine exposures, which requires an understanding of both the specific particle characteristics associated with health effects, and the efficacy of control technologies with respect to these characteristics.</p>

 <p>The objective of this project is to provide a broad-based approach towards reducing silica exposure in surface mining operations through improved understanding of dust generation principles, evaluation and improvement of current control technologies, and development of new control technologies. Laboratory and mine-site development work for improving the highwall drill’s primary dust collection system will be conducted, as well as investigations into improving quality control methods to ensure the integrity of enclosed environmental cabs. Additional efforts will focus on the interactions between drilling parameters and overburden lithology and how this interaction affects respirable dust generation improving dust emission capture under the shroud area, and reducing dust generated at the collector dump point.</p>

 <h4>Tag-Based Proximity Warning System for Construction Equipment</h4>
 <p>The objective of this project is to evaluate newly available tag-based proximity warning systems for use on construction equipment to avoid collisions with workers and other obstacles within the work zone. Tag-based proximity warning systems have the potential to reduce collisions in crowded work areas where other types of proximity warning systems may alarm too often to be effective. There is a need to scientifically evaluate this new technology at various types of construction sites to understand its effectiveness and limitations. Results of this study will be used by regulatory agencies and standards organizations in the formulation of rules and recommended practices. The information will also be presented to contractors and labor organizations making decisions on safety improvements for construction work zones.</p>

 <h4>Targeted Approach Toward Health Hazard Management</h4>
 <p>The purpose of this project is to provide a means of investigating particular occupational health hazards requested by mining stakeholders or others on behalf of our stakeholders, which may be of immediate concern, associated with unplanned events, or not as widely known by the industry as a whole. Hazard issues will be screened based on an extensive literature review and may warrant an on-site investigation including personal, ambient, and biological monitoring using NIOSH monitoring and analytical methods or appropriate direct reading instrumentation. Findings and knowledge gained from these investigations will be translated into recommendations, interventions, and guidelines toward preventing occupational illness and injuries. This project may also serve as a basis for new mining program research projects designed to focus more time and resources toward solving more complex problems.</p>

 <h4>Transferring Cost-Effective Rollover Protective Structure Designs to Industry</h4>
 <p>Agriculture is one of the most dangerous United States industries for occupational fatalities. The largest source of fatal injuries is the tractor. Tractor overturn fatalities contribute greatly to the number of tractor related deaths. The long-term goal for this project is to increase the portion of the United States tractor fleet that is equipped with a rollover protective structure (ROPS) and a seatbelt. A ROPS and seatbelt can prevent almost all tractor overturn fatalities. Recognizing cost can be a prohibiting factor to retrofitting a tractor with a ROPS and seatbelt, this project will continue development of cost-effective ROPS designs for popular non-ROPS tractors. Partnerships will be solicited to commercialize these designs.</p>
