<h2>Internal Research</h2>

<h4>N005 CBR Terrorism Control Technology</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Mike Gressel</p>

<ul>
<li>NIOSH technical report on Building Protection</li>

<li>NIOSH technical report on CBR Filtration</li>

<li>Building vulnerability evaluations of approx. 60 buildings</li>
</ul>

<h4>N006 Engineering Control Technology Research Support for the IRS</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Scott Earnest</p>

<ul>
<li>Control recommendations to reduce worker exposures to CBR agents</li>

<li>Technical report summarizing study findings</li>

<li>(1 paper in journal review)</li>
</ul>

<h4>N008 Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in Control of TB</h4>

<p>Project Officer: James Bennett</p>

<ul>
<li>T his study is evaluating the turbulence models currently used alongside a more accurate turbulence model and experimental results.</li>

<li>Tracer gas or aerosol experiments are being performed in a room sized chamber to obtain concentration fields for comparison with the fields generated using CFD.</li>

<li>A publication is being prepared that makes recommendations for successful CFD simulation of TB care facilities and that evaluates current TB ventilation guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h4>N007 USPS: Emission Controls for Mail Processing and Handling</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Bryan Beamer</p>

<ul>
<li>Changes in engineering controls and work practices were evaluated at the USPS</li>

<li>NIOSH technical reports and a journal article have been written</li>

<li>CFD and experimental data was used to recommend control modifications</li>
</ul>

<h4>7066 NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods Cooperative Research</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Paul Schlecht</p>

<ul>
<li>Coordinated and edited 22 new and 7 updated aerosol methods for 3rd supplement the 4 th edition of NIOSH Manual of Analytical Methods</li>

<li>Performed a user check of 2 aerosol-related methods</li>

<li>Edited 7 new chapters on aerosol related topics for the Manual</li>
</ul>

<h4>7089R Control of Disease Transmission in Commercial Aircraft Cabins</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Jennifer Topmiller</p>

<ul>
<li>A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the interior of a 767 cabin was completed by the contractor. This model will be used to investigate the impact of varying cabin flow conditions (flow rates, temperatures, velocities, etc.) on the flow patterns in the cabin.</li>

<li>An experimental study is underway to conduct Stereoscopic Particle Image Velocimetry (SPIV) measurements of the flow in a mockup of a 5 seat row section of a 767 cabin. The results of this research will be used to validate the analytical model.</li>

<li>An interagency agreement with an independent laboratory is planned to provide confirmation of the modeling procedures used by the CFD contractor. A bioaerosol sampling study is being conducted.</li>
</ul>

<h4>7331 Screening Methods for Airborne Metals in Construction</h4>

<li>Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) for silica (alpha-quartz and cristobalite) were deposited onto filters for working standards (through contract). The protocol used for deposition may be used in the future for a more precise generation of Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) samples.</li>

<li>Generation of alpha-quartz SRMs were used to compare the U.S. standard (NIST 1878a) and the U.K. standard (Sikron F600). Harmonization may be possible since the calibration curves were equivalent when the bulks were passed through a cyclone to correct for particle size differences.</li>

<li>*A survey of 80 laboratories in the silica PAT program found that a small percent of laboratories were responsible for the wide RSD seen in PAT results. A detailed analysis of those laboratories resulted in several publications which listed recommendations for standard laboratory practices. OSHA rule making on the silica standard is considering incorporating these standard practices as part of an appendix.</li>

<li>A high-volume sampler, BGI GK2.69, was tested as a possible alternative sampler. This sampler meets the ACGIH/CEN/ISO respirable aerosol sampling convention and has a sampling rate of nearly two and a half times that of the conventional nylon cyclone, thus enabling collection of more sample mass in the field.</li>

</ul>

<h4>8425 Pulmonary, Immune, and Dermal Effect of Welding Fume Inhalation Exposure</h4>

<p>Project Officer: James M. Antonini</p>

<ul>
<li>Authored comprehensive review of welding literature and published article entitled “Health Effects of Welding”.</li>

<li>Developed laboratory methods to assess the effects of pulmonary aerosol exposure on the susceptibility to lung infection (5 papers). Welding fume decreases the ability of alveolar macrophages to kill bacteria.</li>

<li>Developed new methodology using laser scanning confocal microscopy to study the 3-D deposition of inhaled particles in the lungs (3 papers).</li>

<li>Heading a NIOSH/NTP initiative to assess the chronic effects of welding fume exposure.</li>

</ul>

<h4>8917 Asphalt Fumes: Inflammatory Effects and Pulmonary Injury</h4>

<p>Project Officer: Jane Ma</p>

<ul>
<li>Found that exposure of the lung to asphalt fume did not cause pulmonary inflammation or damage and did not alter the activity of alveolar macrophages or the ability to fight infection.</li>

<li>Exposure of rats to asphalt fume generated under road paving conditions resulted in a significant induction of CYP1A1 and a significant attenuation of CYP2B1 in the lung (1 paper).</li>

<li>Inhalation of asphalt fume resulted in dose-dependent DNA damage in AM.</li>

<li>Asphalt fume exposed-S9 fractions showed greater capacity in activating known mutagenic PAHs.</li>

<li>The genotoxic effects determined in these studies were dose-dependent with respect to the asphalt fume exposure.</li>

<li>Evaluate the affects of exposure to diesel exhaust particles on the ability of lung phagocytes to fight infection. Diesel exhaust particles increased pulmonary susceptibility to infection.</li>

<h4>014 Dust Control in Surface Coal Mining</h4>

<p>Project Officer:</p>

<ul>
<li>At surface coal mine sites, rotary blast hole drills with dry dust collectors were found to be the highest source of dust contamination. Dust levels inside a drill cab were reduced by 90% after retrofitting a filtration system to the cab, a prototype dust collector inlet shroud was designed to improve dust capture at the drill deck</li>

<li>A novel dust sampling method was developed to evaluate the impact of drilling parameters and rock lithology on the amount of dust generated at the source.</li>
</ul>

<h4>016 Diesel Engine Emission Measurement and Analysis</h4>

<p>Project Officer:</p>

<ul>
<li>In partnership with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association and the United Mine Workers of America, developed a complex test matrix to evaluate diesel particulate matter control technologies for use in underground coal mines.</li>

<li>The construction of a portable diesel dynamometer is complete.</li>

<li>Researchers at PRL have been working in Canada with DEEP (Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program) to measure emissions from underground diesel equipment, evaluate control technologies, and refine measurement methodologies.</li>
</ul>

<h4>019 Assessment of Personal Particulate Exposure</h4>

<p>Project Officer:</p>

<ul>
<li>Testing of the 2-piece Personal Dust Monitor (PDM-2) demonstrated that tapered element technology could successfully measure mass on a person in the mine environment. This technology allows miners to monitor their dust exposure during the shift and provides an end-of-shift dust exposure immediately.</li>
</ul>

<h4>090 A Health Hazards Study of Surface Drilling Operations</h4>

<p>Project Officer:</p>

<ul>
<li>A total of 5 (five) workshops were conducted at several national and state conferences affiliated with the surface drilling industry.
