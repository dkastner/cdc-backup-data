A census tract is a small and relatively permanent subdivision of counties that is similar in population and economic characteristics and living conditions. On average supermarkets, supercenters, larger grocery stores, warehouse clubs, and fruit and vegetable specialty stores stock a wide selection of affordable, high quality fruits and vegetables. In 2011, 70% of U.S. Census tracts had a healthy food retailer within ½ mile of boundary.<sup>1</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Significance:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Having access to stores that sell fruits and vegetables and other healthier foods may increase consumption of fruits and vegetables and other healthier foods among adults.<sup>2</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Limitations of Indicator:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Neighborhoods identified as not having at least one healthier food retailer might still have access to healthier foods if smaller stores (e.g. convenience stores, corner stores, etc.) that provide a wide selection and adequate quantity of affordable produce and other items. However, since there is not a systematic way to identify smaller retailers offering healthier foods at a national level, they are not included as a healthier food retailer in this metric. Residents may have additional access to produce in their neighborhoods through farmers markets and farm stands.

Obese women are at increased risk for infertility, pregnancy loss, complications during pregnancy  such  as hypertensive disorders and gestational diabetes, and  cesarean delivery. Fetal risks include  prematurity, stillbirth, neural tube defects, and  an  increased risk of the  child  becoming  obese or developing  heart disease in the future.<sup>1-4</sup> In addition, obese  mothers  are less likely than  those of  normal weight to  begin  breastfeeding  their new baby  or  to  continue  breastfeeding after initiation.<sup>5</sup><br />Based on data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), one-fifth of American women are obese (BMI &gt; 29 kg/m2) at the start of pregnancy, a figure that has risen 70 percent in the past decade.<sup>6-7</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Significance:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>In the non-pregnant state, obesity contributes to numerous adverse health conditions including type II diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, a variety of cancers, and infertility.<sup>8-11</sup>  Obesity is also associated with a host of unfavorable perinatal health outcomes including neural tube defects, labor and delivery complications, fetal and neonatal death, and maternal complications such as gestational diabetes and preeclampsia.<sup>12-16</sup>  While health risks are better established for obese persons, overweight is a predictor of subsequent obesity.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to steadily increasing obesity rates in the general U.S. population, a notable increase toward higher pre-pregnancy BMI in the U.S. has been demonstrated.<sup>17</sup>  Therefore, several professional health organizations and councils, in addition to the Clinical Work Group of the Select Panel on Preconception Care workgroup recommends that all women have their BMI calculated at least annually.<sup>18</sup> Overweight and obese women should be offered healthy strategies to achieve a healthier body weight, especially prior to any future pregnancies.</p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Limitations of Indicator:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Maternal weight and height as recorded on the birth certificate are based on either maternal recall or prenatal records.<sup>19</sup>  Unpublished data demonstrates that birth certificate data underestimate the prevalence of obesity although the data have a satisfactory reliability and validity for surveillance and research purposes (Unpublished data from Florida birth certificates, 2005).
