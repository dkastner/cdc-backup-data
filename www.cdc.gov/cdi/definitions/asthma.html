Effective management includes control of exposure to factors that trigger exacerbations, adequate pharmacological management, continual monitoring of the disease, and patient education in asthma care. With proper management, deaths from asthma are theoretically preventable.<sup>5</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Limitations of Indicator:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>The reliability of death certificate data for asthma has been questioned, particularly for older age groups. Asthma may be over or under reported for adults because of misreporting the cause of death, particularly in people with confounding medical conditions.  In one study, inconsistencies in death certificate completion resulted in “asthma” automatically overriding the underlying cause chosen, leading to an overestimation of asthma deaths among people age 55 and older.<sup>6-7</sup>  In contrast, a larger and well-designed study concluded that asthma death coding had very high specificity (99%) and low sensitivity (42%); that asthma as a cause of death was under-reported rather than over-reported in preference to COPD (58% false negative, 1% false positive); and that there was no age effect.<sup>8</sup> This study casts some doubt on the assumption that coding of asthma deaths in older individuals is unreliable in the United States. However, no studies representative of the entire US vital statistics system have been published.</p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Data Resources:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Death certificate data from vital statistics agencies (numerator) and population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau or suitable alternative (denominator). </p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Limitations of Data Resources:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Causes of death and other variables listed on the death certificate might be inaccurate.</p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Related Indicators or Recommendations:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Healthy People 2020 Objective RD-1: Reduce asthma deaths.
