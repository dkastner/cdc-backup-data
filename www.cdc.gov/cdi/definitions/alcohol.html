time delay between State taxation records and actual consumption; exclusion of alcohol contained in medications and foods; unrecorded legal home production; and illicit production, importation, and sales.<sup>1</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Related Indicators or Recommendations:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Healthy People 2020 Objective SA–16: Reduce average annual alcohol consumption.<br />CDC’s Prevention Status Report: Excessive Alcohol Use.<sup>5</sup></p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Related CDI Topic Area:</p></td><td valign="top"><p> </p></td></tr></table><ol start="1" type="1"><li>National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
