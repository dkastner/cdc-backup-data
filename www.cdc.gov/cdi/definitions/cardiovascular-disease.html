In an effort to address some of these potential concerns, BRFSS began including cell phone only users in the 2011 data collection.  Due to changes in sampling and weighting methodology, 2011 is a new baseline for BRFSS, and comparisons with prior year data are inappropriate.</p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Related Indicators or Recommendations:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Healthy People 2020 Objective HDS-4: Increase the proportion of adults who have had their blood pressure measured within the preceding 2 years and can state whether their blood pressure was normal or high.<br />Healthy People 2020 Objective HDS-5.1: Reduce the proportion of adults with hypertension.</p></td></tr><tr><td scope="row" valign="top"><p>Related CDI Topic Area:</p></td><td valign="top"><p>Alcohol; Diabetes; Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Weight Status; Tobacco</p></td></tr></table><ol start="1" type="1"><li>Klein RJ, Schoenborn CA.
