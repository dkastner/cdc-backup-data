In this TV commercial, Amanda talks about the weeks that her baby girl spent in a hospital incubator, after she was born 2 months early.</p>

In her 11-year-old mind, smoking seemed OK. After all, some family members smoked, so she tried it herself—and soon became a regular smoker, too. In this emotional video, Amanda talks about the pain that smoking brought to her family.</p>
