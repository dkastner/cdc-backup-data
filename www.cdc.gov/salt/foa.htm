<p>About 90% of Americans consume too much sodium, increasing their risk of high blood pressure. Americans consume about 3,400 mg of sodium each day, and the majority of sodium consumed is already present in foods before purchase or preparation. Because of this, reducing sodium intake requires increased availability of lower sodium foods.</p>

<p>Through the FOA, DP16-1607: Sodium Reduction in Communities Program, CDC anticipates awarding approximately $15 million over a five year period to implement and evaluate promising, broad-reaching, and sustainable strategies, while engaging food sector collaborators to facilitate reductions in sodium levels in commercially processed and restaurant foods. The long-term goal of the FOA is to reduce sodium intake to within the current <a href="http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/default.asp"><em>Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em></a> recommendations. Additional outcomes include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased implementation of food service guidelines or standards that include sodium;</li>

<li>Increased integration of procurement practices to reduce sodium content in purchased items;</li>

<li>Increased implementation of food preparation practices to reduce sodium content in meals and/or menu items;</li>

<li>Increased implementation of environmental strategies/behavioral economics approaches;</li>

<li>Increased availability of lower sodium food products; and</li>

<li>Increased purchase or selection of lower sodium food products and/or ingredients by either consumers or large food service operators.</li>
</ul>

<p>Applications are due March 15, 2016, and the five-year cooperative agreement’s anticipated start date is September 30, 2016. Eligibility will not be limited, but applicants should have demonstrated capacity to develop and implement public health strategies to improve nutrition, and capacity to reach at least 500,000 people. More information about the FOA and application requirements is available at <a href="http://www.grants.gov">www.grants.gov</a>.</p>

<p>***Please note that CDC will host an Informational Teleconference to answer questions about the FOA at 3:30 PM (ET) on January 28th, 2016. Please join by calling Toll Number: 1-210-234-0044; or Toll Free Number: 888-810-4938; Participant passcode: 8344668.</p>

<li>“Venue” is defined as a type of setting (e.g. hospitals or senior meal programs)</li>

<li>“Entity” is defined as specific institutions/places within the venue (e.g. Hospital A, Hospital B, Hospital C; or Senior meal site A, senior meal site B, senior meal site C).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Priority venues include: public and private sector worksites; public and private sector programs that purchase and provide food to congregate populations (e.g., senior meal programs, schools, early childhood education centers, programs that serve people in institutionalized settings, etc.); hospitals; and small regional chain restaurants. Applicants may propose to work in a venue beyond the priority venues listed but must provide sufficient justification for working in any other venue by describing the potential reach and impact, and evidence that supports working in this venue.</p>

<p>Priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations.</p>

									<h3>The FOA states that the grantee must demonstrate capacity to reach over 500,000 people. How does CDC recommend this 500,000 reach be calculated?  Is it the total number of people that could be impacted by the interventions?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer: </strong>As part of Section C, titled “Organizational Capacity”, applicants must have demonstrated capacity to reach at least 500,000 people. The FOA does not define how this is calculated. &#160;For more information, please refer to “Target Populations” section of the FOA.</p>

		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> The ceiling for individual award range is $500,000/year. The number of entities funded will depend on the amount of available funding and the number and types of applicants that compete successfully.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Will technical assistance be available regarding the FOA and the process to submit an application?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> A technical assistance conference call will take place January 28, 2016 from 3:30- 5:00 PM U.S. Eastern Time. &#160;At this time, the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP) will review the FOA in detail for participants. Potential applicants may continue to ask questions of the Procurements and Grants Office (PGO) and DHDSP by submitting questions to Hadley Hickner (xxm5@cdc.gov). &#160;Questions and Answers will be posted on the website at <a href="foa.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/salt/foa.htm</a>. Technical assistance regarding electronic submissions will be provided by Grant solutions staff as needed.</p>

									<h3>I cannot attend the FOA conference call on January 28. Is there a way for me to access the recordings for these calls?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;No. This call will not be recorded. Questions and Answers from the call will be posted on the website at <a href="foa.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/salt/foa.htm</a>.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Is there a template available for preparing the Letter of Intent (LOI)?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;No. A Letter of Intent is requested but optional for this FOA. The LOI must be postmarked by March 1, 2016. The LOI serves as a preliminary, non-binding indication of an organization’s intent to submit an application.</p>

									<h3>High blood pressure control is not specifically mentioned in the FOA. Will it count against an applicant if they include interventions related to high blood pressure as long as they address the required strategies? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;With funding through this FOA, applicants are asked to focus on population efforts to reduce sodium. It is acceptable to include high blood pressure control efforts as long as they align with the objectives and outcomes of this FOA.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Is cost sharing or matching required?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Cost sharing or matching funds are not required for this program. Although there is no statutory match requirement for this FOA, leveraging other resources and related ongoing efforts to promote sustainability is strongly encouraged.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What is a cross site evaluation?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;A cross-site evaluation is an evaluation that looks across the funded sites to identify themes, patterns, achievements, and barriers. The purpose of a cross-site evaluation is not to compare funded communities against each other, but to identify common lessons across the communities while also recognizing that each community has unique characteristics and context. The cross-site evaluation of the funded sites will be primarily focused on outcomes and the extent to which the FOA-identified outcomes have been achieved. While implementation of lessons learned will also be included in the cross-site evaluation, process measures are not a primary focus for this FOA.</p>

		</div>
									<h3>How will applications be reviewed?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;All eligible applications will be initially reviewed for completeness by CDC’s Procurement and Grants Office (PGO) staff. In addition, eligible applicants will be jointly reviewed for responsiveness by CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion and PGO. Non-responsive applications will not advance to the next phase of the review. Applicants will be notified that the application did not meet eligibility and/or published submission requirements. An objective review panel will evaluate complete and responsive applications according to the criteria listed in the Review and Selection Process section of the FOA. Applications will be funded in order by score and rank determined by the review panel. In addition, CDC reserves the right to fund applications out of rank order depending on the distribution of sodium reduction interventions across venues and the geographic distribution of the highest scoring applications. Priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations. CDC will notify applicants that are approved but unfunded and unapproved applicants during the same period when funded applicants are notified. Awardees will receive an electronic copy of the Notice of Award from CDC PGO. The NOA shall be the only binding, authorizing document between the awardee and CDC. Approved but unfunded applications remain valid for one year and may be funded if additional resources become available.</p>

									<h3>Can funds be used to buy equipment for a cafeteria or restaurant?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;In most cases, awardees may not use HHS/CDC/ATSDR funding for the purchase of furniture or equipment (pg. 31). Any such proposed spending must be clearly identified in the budget. Awardees will not be permitted to use funding under this FOA for purchasing kitchen equipment for a cafeteria or a restaurant.</p>

									<h3>When applying to work in congregate meal venues, should the applicant specify one of the examples provided in the FOA or leave it open to any one of the examples? For example, could an applicant plan to work with both senior meal programs and early child care education centers under the same venue of congregate meals?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Each applicant should identify two venues and recruit specific entities under each venue. &#160;Applicants may propose to work with entities that provide food to congregate populations generally and/or applicants may specific a particular congregate population with which to work. When determining which venues to select, we encourage applicant to consider the time and resources that it will take to address each venue. Each additional type of congregate meal program selected will likely require more time and resource investment to achieve and measure outcomes.&#160;</p>

		</div>
									<h3>The word &#8220;vendors&#8221; is used as an example for organizations/groups that represent the food sector. Can a &#8220;vendor&#8221; be a state-central procurement office if that office is responsible for establishing and managing contracts for other government departments?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicant should provide justification for the collaboration with the selected food sector organization/group. The examples listed in the FOA are examples of potential food sector partners and do not represent an exhaustive list of groups. Applicants should provide letters of commitment to the project for the selected organizations/groups.</p>

									<h3>Small, regional chain restaurants are mentioned as a priority venue. Would a national chain that operates under a regional franchise count as national chain or small regional chain?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;If selecting a venue that is operated at national level, the applicant should provide an explanation of how decisions are made at individual or regional locations. &#160;The intent is that the entities with which the applicant is proposing to work will have the authority to make changes at the local/entity level.</p>

									<h3>Can you clarify the reach as 5,000 vs. 500,000?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The organization applying for the award must have the organizational capacity to reach 500,000. The applicant must specify two venues with entities that serve and/or sell food, reaching at least 5,000 people per day. &#160;For more information on defining venues and entities, please see page 7 of the FOA.</p>

		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;For this FOA, a venue is defined as a type of setting (e.g. hospitals or senior meal programs) and entity is defined as specific institutions/places within the venue (e.g. Hospital A, Hospital B, Hospital C; or Senior meal site A, senior meal site B, senior meal site C). Applicants may propose to work in a venue beyond the priority venues listed on Page 7 of FOA but must provide sufficient justification for working in any other venue by describing the potential reach and impact, and evidence that supports working in this venue. Priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations.</p>

									<h3>Will awardees from last round be able to apply for the same geographic region?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Current SRCP funding will end September 29, 2016. No continuation opportunity will be offered. The new SRCP (DP 13-1607) will be open to all eligible entities. Current SRCP grantees will have to apply according to the same criteria as all other applicants.</p>

									<h3>Is the federal negotiated indirect rate supplemental or included in the award amount?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The indirect costs are a part of total award amount (total financial assistance).</p>

									<h3>You noted the Letter Of Intent (LOI) is not required. If submitted, will there be feedback?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;CDC will acknowledge receipt of Letters of Intent, but CDC will not provide any feedback on the letters. The Letters of Intent are used for planning purposes.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Does the FOA allow organizations to submit more than one application?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Only one application per organization will be accepted.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Can an applicant team up with other organizations to submit an application?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Nothing prohibits an organization from applying in coordination with another. However, one primary applicant (organization) of the multiple coordinating organizations is to submit an application for funding under the registrations of a DUNS number and SAM in Grants.gov. If awarded, actual performance of programmatic activities under a cooperative agreement (grant) is to be managed and administered by a primary awardee. Therefore, arrangements of sub-awardee or contractor relationships are necessary before submission of the application. An establishment of a consortium relationship is too late at this time for registration of DUNS number and SAM.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Are international organizations eligible to apply? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;International organizations do not fit under any eligibility category of the FOA (please see page 17 of the FOA for a complete list).</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>If an applicant plans to use local contractors to work with entities in 2 different venues, such as hospitals and senior meal sites, can the reach of these entities within one venue be combined to meet the required 5,000/day reach?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Each venue should have the potential to reach 5,000/day across all sub-awardees. Priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>If a state is planning on working with sub-awardees in counties, does each county need to select one of the required (bolded) performance measures of each outcome or is it by state?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The required performance measures are an aggregate for each awardee. Therefore, one required (bolded) performance measure should be selected across the primary awardee’s work plan, not necessarily in by each sub-awardee.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>If a state agency plans to subcontract with counties, does each county need to demonstrate a capacity of 500,000?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;As part of the Project Description, section (c), titled “Organizational Capacity of Awardees to Implement the Approach”, applicants must have demonstrated capacity to reach at least 500,000 people. The FOA does not define how this is calculated. For more information, please refer to “Target Populations” section of the FOA.</p>

									<h3>It is specified that the Year-1 workplan needs to be detailed. What is expected for Years 2-5?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;In addition to the Year 1 detailed workplan, applicants must provide a high-level plan for subsequent years that describes an overall integrated approach to achieving sodium reduction. This plan does not need to include specific activities, but rather a general statement describing what the applicant expects to accomplish in subsequent years of the FOA. The optional workplan template provided includes a “narrative” section under each venue. High-level description of plans for the remainder of the FOA can be entered here.</p>

<p>About 120 days before the completion of the first year project, CDC will publish a guidance for Annual Progress Report (APR) in Grants.gov, which serves as a non-competing continuation application for the 2nd year. In this guidance, detailed guidance will be provided for required level of detailed work-plans for year 2 as well as reporting of the actual progress made in the proposed/approved work plans in the year 1.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>A required performance measure is to be selected for each outcome area. Does the &#8220;outcome area&#8221; mean? For example: is it one performance measure for all short term outcomes or does it mean one performance measure per each different short term outcome? </h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;At least 1 required (bolded) performance measure should be identified for each individual, corresponding outcome in all levels (short term, intermediate, and long term).</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>In the venue of congregate meals, can an applicant mix senior meals, ECEs etc. to get to 5,000/day capacity?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The FOA does not describe that an applicant is limited to a particular congregate population with which to work. We encourage the applicant to consider the time and resources that it will take to address each venue and entities within that venue. Each additional type of congregate meal program selected will likely require more time and resource investment to achieve and measured outcomes. A written justification for selecting venues and entities should be provided. Priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Are hospitals considered congregate meal programs?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;In the FOA, hospitals are listed as a separate venue. Work with hospitals should primary focus on retail settings to avoid confliction or infringement on medically prescribed therapeutic patient meals. For this reason, we suggest considering hospitals as a separate venue; however, applicants could make a case for including hospitals as congregate meal sites.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>What are the anticipated award amounts?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">

									<h3>Would a local GSA facility be an eligible partner?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicants are expected to work with organizations that have a role in achieving the FOA outcomes, specifically: 1) at least two types of venues that serve and/or sell food, reaching at least 5,000 people per day and 2) at least one organization/group that is a part of or that represents some component of the food sector (e.g. vendors, suppliers, and/or related trade association affiliates).</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Do independent grocery stores and corner stores count as a food sector organization? Is there a list of potential food sector organizations CDC is prioritizing to work with?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;An applicant may collaborate with any organization or group that represents some component of the food sector that may facilitate reductions in sodium levels of commercially processed and restaurant foods offered or sold by the applicant’s selected venues. The applicant should specifically describe how they will collaborate with that organization(s) while implementing and evaluating expansive and sustainable intervention strategies in venues that serve large populations. A non-exhaustive list of food sector organization/group examples, noted in the FOA include: vendors, suppliers, or other related trade association affiliates.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Is there a cap on indirect costs?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;There is no cap on the indirect cost rate, which is negotiated with a cognizant Federal agency. Accordingly, there is no cap on indirect costs. Total Indirect Costs should be included in the Budget Narrative. If requesting indirect costs in the budget, a copy of the indirect cost-rate agreement is required. If the indirect costs are requested, include a copy of the current negotiated federal indirect cost rate agreement or a cost allocation plan approval letter for those grantees under such a plan.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;All applicants should include a propose budget for travel for at least two representatives to attend a CDC-sponsored meeting (not to exceed three days) related to the strategies being implemented as part of this FOA. CDC will provide guidance for additional meetings in subsequent continuation applications as necessary.</p>

									<h3>If we wanted to pilot a new contracting model for fresh fruit and vegetable purchasing for city departments implementing nutrition standards, could grant funds be used for that contract? In other words, could the grant pay for a food contract, provided that the act of setting the specifications and requirements for the contract would be setting up a new long term procurement practice for the City?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Costs for a food contract and procurement of equipment are allowable costs if the procurements of foods and equipment are necessary for achieving the goals and purpose of project under the FOA and if the costs are allowable, reasonable, and allocable in accordance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt45.1.75&amp;rgn=div5#sp45.1.75.d">USG Code of Federal Regulations</a> (see 45CFR75, Subpart E). When determining whether or not proposed activities are in line with the FOA outcomes (see page 6 of the FOA), applicants should first answer the 4 questions on page 10 of the FOA. Applicants must also propose at least one measure in bold for each outcome area in which the applicant is working (refer to pages 10-12 for outcome areas and respective performance measures).</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>I know that traditionally equipment is also not allowed.  Would this include the purchase of refrigeration or display baskets/materials for shelters and/or home cooking mini kits for residents transitioning out of the shelter?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Generally, awardees may not use funds to purchase furniture or equipment. Any such proposed spending must be clearly identified in the budget. Applicants must consider whether the proposed spending is necessary to achieve the purpose and outcomes under the FOA and that costs are reasonable and consistent with the program strategy outlined in the project narrative of the FOA.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Would CDC fund a program working with a food distributor in the reformulation of foods if the evaluation could not be identified at the consumer level?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;If proposed activities are in line with the intent of the FOA and will allow the applicant to achieve the outcomes identified in the FOA, the application and activities will be considered and scored according to the objective review criteria located on pages 30-33 of the FOA.</p>

<p>Further, the Evaluation and Performance Measurement Plan does not specify the level that data collection should occur. The applicant should be able to address the 4 evaluation questions listed on page 10 of the FOA and should propose at least one performance measure in bold for each outcome area in which the applicant is proposing to work (pg. 10-12).</p>

<p>CDC will work with awardees to operationalize the required outcome performance measures and assist with the identification of sound data collection approaches and/or the availability of existing data collection instruments. Applicants may propose additional outcome measures than those listed above. Applicants must provide a rationale for proposing measures that are not included.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Can for-profit organizations serve as food sector partners and be sub-contracted to receive funding to support workplan activities?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;An applicant may propose to work with non-federal, profit or non-profit contractual organization(s). These contracts must be specified in the application and the organization must significantly contribute to the implementation of program strategies and achievement of project outcomes. The grantee must procure its contractor in accordance with its own established procurement policies, which are in compliance with <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?node=pt45.1.75&amp;rgn=div5#sp45.1.75.d">USG Code of Federal Regulations</a> (see 45CFR75, subpart D, section 326-335, Procurement Standards). Therefore, if in compliance, the grantee can procure goods and services from a for-profit organization. Please note that food/meal costs are allowable if they are necessary for programmatic purposes.</p>

<p>As indicated in the FOA’s project description, applicants will also be required to work with at least one organization/group that is a part of or that represents some component of the food sector (e.g. vendors, suppliers, and/or related trade association affiliates). The FOA does not prohibit an organization from serving as both a contractor to implement the approach and a food sector partner with which the applicant will collaborate.</p>

			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicants should provide letters of support from partners that detail their commitment to the selected strategies and to achieving the selected outcomes. The specific expectation, role and/or level of commitment outlined in the letter should be based on the outcomes identified in the applicant’s application and negotiated between the applicant and the partner considering each organization’s priorities. Letters of support/commitment can be included as Appendices.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;With the funding through this FOA, applicants are asked to focus on two venues. An applicant may propose work with three venues as long as efforts align with the objectives and outcomes of the FOA, but should consider the time and resources it will take to address each venue.</p>

									<h3>Is the Sodium Reduction in Communities cooperative agreement funded with ACA funds?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;No. For FY 2016, The Sodium Reduction in Communities Program is funded with basic budget authority funds.</p>

									<h3>Do we identify performance measures that will not be met in year one or do we discuss those in the narrative for years 2-5?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;In the year 1 workplan, the applicant will need to identify all expected performance measures that will be addressed during the project period based on the interventions selected. Performance measurement helps demonstrate achievement of program outcomes and drives continuous program improvement. In order to accurately monitor progress, performance measures require sound baselines and valid target measures. The applicant has the ability to create lower targets for year 1, if movement in a performance measure is anticipated to be slower in year 1 when compared to subsequent years. The applicant must provide adequate justification for why those measures are projected to be lower. The voluntary workplan template includes a “narrative” section for each venue, in which applicants can identify high-level descriptions of plans for the remainder of the FOA; this could potentially include performance measures that you expect to track during subsequent budget periods. Alternatively, applicants may include all planned performance measures in the application narrative. Awardees will be required to submit a more detailed Evaluation and Performance Measurement plan within the first 6 months of the award.</p>

									<h3>Are reach estimates calculated as total reach across the 5-year project or as reach for year 1?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Reach estimates are the total reach for the entire 5-year project period. Awardees will be expected to report reach annually for each of the five years, including the aggregate of reach for the entire project period. The calculation used to determine reach is by the applicant’s discretion; the FOA does not outline a definition. Priority will be placed on proposals that reach the largest populations.</p>

	</div>

									<h3>The FOA specifies that applicants &#8220;should provide letters of commitment to the project from at least one organization/group representing some component of the food sector and from at least two entities, representing one venue each.&#8221;  If hospitals are one of our venues, is it acceptable to submit a letter of commitment for a system of hospitals signed by the parent organization&#8217;s CEO to demonstrate commitment system-wide?  Or would we need to submit a letter of commitment from one specific hospital (as our &#8220;entity&#8221;) within the system?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The expectations for letters of commitment are as follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Letter of commitment from at least one organization/group representing some component of the food sector</li>

<li>At least 1 letter from an entity of each venue identified in the application (applicants should select 2 venues)</li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, it is acceptable for an applicant to submit a letter of commitment by a partnered hospital system, representing one or multiple hospitals engaged in activities under the venue ‘hospitals’. At least one other letter of commitment will be expected from an entity of a different venue.</p>

									<h3>Page 28 of the FOA states that awardees generally may not use HHS/CDC/ATSDR funding for the purchase of furniture or equipment. What is the definition of &#8220;kitchen equipment&#8221;?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The applicant should first refer to its organization’s established policy classification of “equipment” and “supplies”. In the absence of the non-Federal entity’s own established policy for classification of equipment, the entity should use the federal government defined equipment classification policy in the Code of Federal Regulations (45CFR75) which defines equipment as tangible personal property (including information technology systems) having a useful life of more than one year and a per-unit acquisition cost which equals or exceeds the lesser of the capitalization level established by the non-Federal entity for financial statement purposes, or $5,000. Any kitchen equipment means equipment in a kitchen, a restaurant, and a cafeteria uses for foods preparation/cooking such as refrigerator and any other cooking equipment that can be defined as cited in the Code of Federal Regulations (45CFR75). Applicants must consider whether the proposed spending for equipment and supplies is necessary to achieve the purpose and outcomes under the FOA and that costs are reasonable and consistent with the program strategy outlined in the project narrative of the FOA. Any such proposed spending must be clearly identified in the budget.</p>

									<h3>Do the 12 pt. font requirements apply to the logic models/charts/graphs and can logic models be included in the appendix or do they need to be included in the narrative?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The 12-point font requirements do not apply to logic models/charts/graphs. The logic model should be included in the project narrative. Awardees will be required to submit a more detailed Evaluation and Performance Measurement plan within the first 6 months of award, as described in the Reporting Section of this FOA. Updated logic models may be submitted at this time as well.</p>

									<h3>Will preference be given to larger counties with populations over 500,000?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Eligibility is unrestricted for this FOA, however each applicant must have the organizational capacity to reach 500,000. As noted in the FOA, priority will be placed on proposals that will reach the largest populations. (FOA pages 7, 17, 33)</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Can mass media (e.g., billboards, radio, etc.) be included in the calculation of organizational capacity to reach 500,000 people?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Although the FOA does not specify a formula for determining reach, organizational reach should measure the actual and potential number of people or entities served by the intervention and reflect the interventions’ scope. Since proposed media/consumer information activities cannot be a stand-alone activity under the FOA, it is not advisable to rely on mass media campaigns to measure organizational capacity. The organization applying for the award must have the organizational capacity to reach 500,000. The applicant must specify two venues with entities that serve and/or sell food, reaching at least 5,000 people per day.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>If two counties (Public Health Departments) are applicants, can the organizational capacity be calculated as the population of both counties combined?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;As part of the Project Description, section (c), titled “Organizational Capacity of Awardees to Implement the Approach”, applicants must have demonstrated capacity to reach at least 500,000 people. The FOA does not define a formula for calculating reach. CDC suggests clearly defining organizational capacity, reach and impact of all interventions. Please note: Nothing prohibits an organization from applying in coordination with another. However, one primary applicant (organization) of the multiple coordinating organizations is to submit an application for funding under the registrations of a DUNS number and SAM in Grants.gov. If awarded, actual performance of programmatic activities under a cooperative agreement (grant) is to be managed and administered by a primary awardee. Therefore, arrangements of sub-awardee or contractor relationships are necessary before submission of the application. An establishment of a consortium relationship is too late at this time for registration of DUNS number and SAM.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Should applicants provide a budget for the 5 year period and then provide 5 individual budgets for years 1 through 5?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicants must prepare an overall budget in a summary format for each of 5 years budget periods of the project period for SRCP. In addition, a detailed budget must be prepared for the first year budget period in a summary format with justifications showing (1) computation of $ amounts and (2) narrative justification of the budget costs category line items. The summary budgets for each of the 5 years budget periods and the detailed budget for the first year budget period must be submitted into www.grants.gov as a separate attachment.</p>

<p>A single project period for SRCP consists of 5 annual budget periods. Annual awards are subject to the availability of funds and satisfactory performance of agreed to project activities. Approximately 120 days before the end of first year budget period, awardees are required to submit Annual Performance Report (APR) for the first year performance period including a detailed budget for the non-competing continuation funding year subsequent to the end of the first year budget period. This same process will be repeated for the remaining budget periods in the project period for non-competing continuation funding. Awardees will be required to submit detailed annual budgets at the time of submitting APR for continuation funding.</p>

<p>Please review the Award Information on pages 16-17 of the FOA for more information. For additional guidance on completing a detailed budget, see Budget Preparation Guidelines at: <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/applicationresources.html">http://www.cdc.gov/grants/interestedinapplying/applicationresources.html</a>.</p>

									<h3>What defines an entity&#8217;s &#8220;type of setting&#8221;, and therefore venue category?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The FOA describes a venue as a “type of setting” but does not provide criteria for categorizing each venue. Applicants should use their best judgment and consider available resources and bandwidth when arbitrating criteria for venue categorization. Applicants may propose to work in a venue beyond the priority venues listed in the FOA but must provide sufficient justification by describing the potential reach and impact, and evidence that supports working in this venue. Additionally, the applicant will be required to recruit specific entities within the venues to implement sodium reduction strategies/interventions listed on page 7 of the FOA.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Should the organization/group that &#8220;represents some component of the food sector&#8221; be one that specifically works within the two venues identified? Or should the work with this representative be done more broadly across the jurisdiction or region the applicant works in, and thus be considered a separate intervention? If the work with the food partner is considered an intervention, would we need to submit a logic model for that work?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Applicants should identify two venues and recruit specific entities within the venues to implement sodium reduction strategies/interventions. The selected strategies/interventions should be outlined in the venue-specific logic model (see FOA page 5). In addition, there is an expectation that awardees will work with at least one organization/group that is part of or that represents some component of the food sector (e.g. vendors, suppliers, and/or related trade association affiliates). This activity does not require a logic model. The food sector partner may work to, but is not limited to, enhance the strategies/interventions of identified venues. Throughout the five years of the project period, CDC will work individually and collectively with each of the awardees to answer the evaluation questions based on the program logic model.</p>

									<h3>What are the page limits for this FOA&#8217;s application?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The total application does not have a page limit. However, the FOA does describe page limits for specific sections of the application, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project Abstract Summary (1 page limit)</li>

<li>Project Narrative (20 page limit), which includes the work plan and the evaluation and performance measurement plan</li>

<li>There is no limit to the number of attachments that can be uploaded (please review the list of acceptable attachment). The FOA has been amended to allow work plans to be uploaded as attachments. The uploaded plan will still be counted towards the Project Narrative page limit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note: A template for the work plan can be found at <a href="foa.htm">www.cdc.gov/salt/foa.htm</a>. Applicants are not required to use the template; however, it does represent the required elements that will be used to track performance annually. If the provided work plan template is used, the instruction pages do not count towards the page limit. The template is in a locked format and therefore unused lines cannot be removed. If this causes an applicant to exceed the 20 page limit by a minimal amount, all pages will still be reviewed.</p>

									<h3>Within the performance measures provided in the RFA, each one lists % and #, can we chose one of these or do we have to have both a percentage and number?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;The FOA requires at least 1 required (bolded) performance measure identified for each outcome. Applicants will need to address both percentage and number for every selected performance measure.</p>

	</div>
	  
		</div>
									<h3>Can you clarify the performance measures for people and entities? I.e. when the performance measures refer to the % and # of &#8220;people&#8221;, is people referring to the individuals reached through the chosen venues/entities or the total reachable population of at least 500,000? When the performance measures refer to % and # of &#8220;entities&#8221;, is it referring to the proposed 2 or more entities within each venue or all the possible entities within each venue in the geographic area targeted?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Formulas for measures are not provided in the FOA as approaches should be based on the grantees availability and accessibility of data and data collection instruments. CDC will work with awardees to operationalize the required outcome performance measures and assist with the identification of sound data collection approaches and/or the availability of existing data collection instruments. Applicants should use formulas that best describe the reach and impact that selected interventions have on people and entities.

			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;According to the Federal Regulations <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2004-title45-vol1/CFR-2004-title45-vol1-part93">CFR 45 Part 93 – New Restrictions on Lobbying</a>, no person seeking to apply for or currently receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan or cooperative agreement should pay any person (in any way affiliated with the awarding agency) to influence the decision to award Federal contracts, grants, loans, cooperative agreements and the extension, continuation, renewal, amendment, or modification of any Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement.</p>

<p>Anyone who intends to apply for or is receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from an agency is required to certify that they have not made, and will not make any payments as prohibited by paragraph (a) of this section. Applicants are required to certify this on SF 424 - Application for Federal Assistance (Page 4 # 21). Only if applicants have agreed to make payments or have already engaged in making payments in a manner that is prohibited, must the applicant disclose the specific activities by filing a disclosure form with the agency that they are requesting or receiving a Federal contract, grant, loan, or cooperative agreement from.</p>

		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row tp-collapsible tp-collapsible-collapsed">
    	
<p><strong>Answer:</strong> &#160;Executive Order 12372 references Intergovernmental Reviews. According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a list of participating states can be found at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants_spoc">https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants_spoc</a>. The SPOC list is updated as of 12/23/2015. States that are not listed on this page have chosen not to participate in the intergovernmental review process, and therefore do not have a SPOC. If an applicant is located within a State that does not have a SPOC, application materials may be sent directly to a Federal awarding agency. For applicants within States that are not participating, the recommendation is to print out the full list of participating States, (a) include a copy with the application as a verification and (b) maintain a copy of this verification for records and future referencing.</p>
