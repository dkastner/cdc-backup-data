		<h3>Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) at a rodent breeding facility in Indiana</h3>
		<div class="subColumns">
		  <div class="subc">
        	<p>In late April 2012, CDC was notified about a patient with aseptic meningitis who worked at a rodent breeding facility in Indiana. Testing revealed that the cause of the patient&#39;s illness was Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Further testing at the rodent breeding facility showed evidence of current or past LCMV infection in 13 out of 52 employees. Of the five employees who sought medical treatment, four were diagnosed with aseptic meningitis.</p><p>The rodent breeding facility bred and raised mice and rats primarily for sale as frozen feeder animals for reptiles or birds of prey, with regular shipments of live mice. Testing at CDC of frozen mice from the facility indicated evidence of LCMV infection in 20.8 percent of the mice. Rats sampled for testing showed no signs of LCMV infection. In May 2012, a quarantine prohibiting shipping of mice and rats from the facility was enacted and all live mice at the facility were subsequently depopulated; all frozen product was safely disposed of.</p><p>Shipping records indicate that live mice were shipped to distributors, pet stores, breeders and individuals in 21 states. The affected states are currently conducting traceout activities to detect any infected mice that were shipped to purchasers before the quarantine. To date, no subsequent human cases of LCMV infection have been reported.</p><p>People using frozen or live rodents for feeding to other animals should always follow safety precautions, including wearing gloves when handling animal product, and washing hands with soap and water after handling animal products.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li>

		<h3>Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever, Imported Case - United States</h3>
		<div class="subColumns">
		  <div class="subc">
        	<p>On January 22, 2009, CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch retrospectively diagnosed a case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in a U.S. traveler, who was hospitalized, discharged, and fully recovered. Initial testing of samples collected during the patient&#39;s acute illness in January, 2008 did not initially show evidence of Marburg virus infection. Testing of a convalescent sample indicated a possible previous infection, and more detailed testing of both samples at CDC confirmed that the patient&#39;s illness was due to Marburg hemorrhagic fever.</p><p>The recovered patient had visited the &quot;python cave&quot; in Maramagambo Forest, Queen Elizabeth Park, western Uganda. This is a popular destination among tourists to see a cave inhabited by thousands of bats; a fatal case of Marburg hemorrhagic fever occurred in a Dutch tourist in July 2008 who had entered this cave. Both patients likely acquired their infections as a result of contact with cave-dwelling fruit bats, which are capable of harboring Marburg virus. Marburg virus is a zoonotic virus that occurs in tropical areas of Africa, and causes a severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. It can also be transmitted through direct contact with a symptomatic patient or materials contaminated with infectious body fluids. The Ugandan Ministry of Health officially closed the cave to visitors in August 2008, after the Dutch case.</p><p>The state and local health departments are working with CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch and Traveler&#39;s Health and Animal Importation Branch to further investigate the circumstances of this patient&#39;s case. This includes an assessment of any persons who may have been at risk of exposure at the time the patient was ill, and an investigation of travelers potentially exposed when visiting this or other caves in Africa. There is no evidence of apparent transmission as a result of this case.</p><p>Travelers should be aware of the risk of acquiring Marburg hemorrhagic fever and other potentially fatal diseases such as rabies after contact with bats. Healthcare providers should be aware of the risk of viral hemorrhagic fever among travelers returning from endemic countries, and should report any suspected cases immediately to their health department and to CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch (Tel. (404) 639-1115; (404) 639-2888 after hours) for diagnostic testing and further guidance.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li>

		<h3>Ebola-Reston Virus Detected in Pigs in Philippines</h3>
		<div class="subColumns">
		  <div class="subc">
        	<p>On October 25, 2008, CDC received samples of pig tissues, sera and cell cultures from FADDL, the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory on Plum Island, NY. The samples, originally collected from pig farms outside Manila, were initially tested at the Plum Island facility, which identified multiple swine pathogens, including Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) virus and porcine circovirus type 2. Additional testing by molecular analysis also tentatively identified, for the first time in pigs, Ebola-Reston virus. Further testing of the samples at CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch and Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch confirmed the presence of Ebola-Reston virus. Sequence analysis conducted at FADDL and CDC revealed that the virus is similar to the Ebola-Reston virus that infected macaques from the Philippines imported into the U.S. for research in 1989, 1990 and 1996, and into Italy in 1992.</p><p>The clinical significance of Ebola-Reston in pigs is unknown, since many of the samples were obtained from pigs with dual PRRSV and Ebola-Reston virus infections. Epidemiologic investigations by Philippine authorities are continuing to look for evidence of human disease associated with infected pigs. Ebola-Reston virus is of unknown pathogenicity in humans. Recent studies of small numbers of Philippine slaughterhouse workers revealed antibodies to Ebola-Reston virus, with no clinical disease.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li>

		<h3>Hemorrhagic Fever due to Novel Old World Arenavirus, Zambia and South Africa</h3>
		<div class="subColumns">

        	<p>On October 2, 2008, CDC-Zambia notified CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch about a cluster of 2 cases of a fatal febrile illness suspected to be a viral hemorrhagic fever, with probable person-to-person transmission. Both patients were medevac&#39;d from Zambia to South Africa and died shortly thereafter. During hospitalization, further transmission occurred in three other hospital workers, two of whom also subsequently died. Further investigation revealed the causative agent to be a novel Old World arenavirus, genetically distinct from other arenaviruses such as Lassa and LCM. The novel arenavirus has been named Lujo virus. CDC&#39;s Viral Special Pathogens Branch and Infectious Diseases Pathology Branch worked closely with colleagues in CDC-Zambia, the Viral Special Pathogens Unit, National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NCID) in South Africa, and CDC-South Africa, as well as the respective National Ministries of Health, to provide laboratory and epidemiologic support.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li>

        	<p>On July 10, 2008 CDC was notified by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) about a case of Marburg Hemorrhagic Fever in a woman from The Netherlands. The woman had recently returned from traveling in Uganda. On one occasion the woman had contact with a bat in a cave in the Maramagambo forest in Western Uganda (at the southern edge of Queen Elizabeth National Park), and became ill after returning to The Netherlands. Laboratory testing at the Bernhard Nocht Institute in Hamburg, Germany revealed evidence of Marburg virus infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The patient died on Thursday July 11, 2008 in the morning.</p><p>ECDC is working with health authorities in The Netherlands and the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond to the situation.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li>
