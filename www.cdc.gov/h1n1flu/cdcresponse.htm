<p><em>This document summarizes key events of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and CDC’s response activities for historical purposes. This document is a summary; it is not a comprehensive account of all CDC actions and activities nor is it intended to represent response efforts by other agencies and partners.</em></p>
<h3 ><a name="Background" id="Background"></a><strong>Pandemic  Preparedness, Background</strong></h3>
<p>The 2009 H1N1 influenza  (flu) pandemic occurred against a backdrop of pandemic response planning at all  levels of government including years of developing, refining and regularly  exercising response plans at the international, federal, state, local, and  community levels. At the time, experts believed that avian influenza A (H5N1)  viruses posed the greatest pandemic threat. H5N1 viruses were endemic in  poultry in parts of the world and were infecting people sporadically, often with  deadly results. Given that reality, pandemic preparedness efforts were largely based  on a scenario of severe human illness caused by an H5N1 virus. Despite  differences in planning scenarios and the actual 2009 H1N1 pandemic, many of  the systems established through pandemic planning were used and useful for the  2009 H1N1 pandemic response. </p>
<p>CDC’s response to the 2009  H1N1 pandemic response was complex, multi-faceted and long-term, lasting more  than a year. This document seeks to document for the public the key events of  the pandemic as they unfolded and CDC’s response. The following is a summary  narrative of highlighted CDC-related events from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<h3><a name="virus_emerges" id="virus_emerges"></a><strong>A Virus Emerges</strong></h3>
<p>2009 H1N1 was first detected in the United States in April 2009. This  virus was a unique combination of influenza virus genes never previously  identified in either animals or people. The virus genes were a combination of  genes most closely related to North American swine-lineage H1N1 and Eurasian  lineage swine-origin H1N1 influenza viruses. Because of this, initial reports  referred to the virus as a swine origin influenza virus. However,  investigations of initial human cases did not identify exposures to pigs and  quickly it became apparent that this new virus was circulating among humans and  not among U.S. pig herds.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm">Infection  with this new influenza A virus (then referred to as ‘swine origin influenza A  virus’) was first detected in a 10-year-old patient in California</a> on April 15, 2009,  who was tested for influenza as part of a clinical study. Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed that this virus was new  to humans. Two days later, CDC laboratory testing confirmed a second infection  with this virus in another patient, an 8-year-old living in California about  130 miles away from the first patient who was tested as part of an influenza  surveillance project. There was no known connection between the two patients. Laboratory  analysis at CDC determined that the viruses obtained from these two patients  were very similar to each other, and different from any other influenza viruses  previously seen either in humans or animals. Testing showed that these two viruses  were resistant to the two antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine, but susceptible  to the antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir. CDC began an immediate  investigation into the situation in coordination with state and local animal  and human health officials in California.</p>
<p>  The  cases of 2009 H1N1 flu in California occurred in the context of sporadic  reports of human infection with North American-lineage <a href="../flu/swineflu/index.html">swine influenza viruses</a> in  the United States, most often associated with close contact with infected pigs.  (During  December 2005 – January 2009, 12 cases of human infection with swine influenza  were reported; five of these 12 cases occurred in patients who had direct  exposure to pigs, six patients reported being near pigs, and the source of  infection in one case was unknown). Human-to-human spread  swine influenza viruses had been rarely documented and had not been known to  result in widespread community outbreaks among people. In mid-April of 2009,  however, the detection of two patients infected with swine  origin flu viruses 130 miles apart, raised concern that a novel swine-origin  influenza virus had made its way into the human population and was spreading  among people. <br />
  </p>
<p>CDC remained in close contact with the international health  community as the outbreak unfolded and  on April 18, 2009, under the International Health Regulations (IHR) the  United States International Health Regulations Program reported the 2009 H1N1  influenza cases to the World Health Organization (WHO). The cases also were  reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), Canada and Mexico, as  part of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.</p>
<h3><a name="Response_Ramps_Up" id="Response_Ramps_Up"></a><strong>Response Ramps Up</strong></h3>
<p>CDC worked closely with state and local animal and human health  officials on epidemiological investigations by tracing contacts of both  patients to try to determine the source of their infection and by examining  whether there was any link between the patients and pigs. Surveillance also was  enhanced to try to detect additional cases of human illness with this virus.  Based on the geographic location of the first cases, lack of contact between these  cases and swine, and data collected through contact tracing and laboratory  testing, CDC epidemiologists suspected that human-to-human transmission of this  virus had taken place. In an article entitled <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm">Swine  Influenza A (H1N1) Infection in Two Children --- Southern California,  March-April 2009</a> published on April 21, 2009 in  the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/about.html">Morbidity and  Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)</a>, CDC  described the cases and requested that state public health laboratories send to  CDC all influenza A specimens that could not be subtyped. That same day CDC responded  to media inquiries related to the MMWR from medical reporters. Within a day,  three additional samples of this new virus were identified in San Diego County  and Imperial County California hospitals and sent to CDC for further testing.  CDC laboratory testing confirmed that these samples also were positive for  the virus that  would come to be called “2009 H1N1.”</p>
<p>  By April 21, 2009, CDC had begun working to develop a virus that  could be used to make vaccine to protect against this new virus (called a  candidate vaccine virus). There are many steps involved with producing a  vaccine – the first step is getting a good high yield vaccine virus. A  high-yield vaccine virus is a sample of the virus that is used to grow the  virus in mass quantities in chicken eggs. Once the virus is grown in mass  quantities, the virus particles are then purified to make vaccine. Recognizing  that 2009 H1N1 was a new flu virus – and, like all flu viruses, unpredictable -  CDC simultaneously pursued multiple scientific methods to create a high-yield  virus. A virus isolated at CDC, (called A/California/07/2009) was eventually chosen  to be the vaccine virus used to make vaccine. CDC sent the vaccine virus to  vaccine manufacturing companies so that they could begin vaccine production, in  the event that the U.S. government should decide a vaccine was necessary.</p>
<p>  CDC activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) on April 22,  2009, to coordinate the response to this emerging public health threat. Response  activities were organized into a team structure according to the <a href="http://www.fema.gov/emergency/nims/AboutNIMS.shtm">National  Incident Management System (NIMS)</a>These teams had  different areas of focus including but not limited to: surveillance, laboratory  issues, communications, at-risk populations, antiviral medications, vaccine,  and traveler’s health issues. As the outbreak unfolded, team structures and  staffing were periodically assessed for functionality and utility.</p>
<p>  On April 23, 2009, samples submitted by Texas revealed two  additional cases of human infections with 2009 H1N1, transforming the  investigation into a multistate outbreak and response. At the same time, CDC was testing 14 samples from Mexico, some of which had been collected from patients who were ill before the first 2 U.S. (California) patients. Results from seven of the samples were positive for 2009 H1N1 and similar findings were reported for specimens submitted by Mexico to Canada. It had now become clear that cases were occurring in multiple countries and human to human spread of the virus appeared to be ongoing.  That same day CDC held  the first formal full press briefing to inform the media and guide the  public and health care response to the rapidly evolving situation. CDC held nearly 60 press briefings during the 2009 H1N1 response.</p>
<p>  On April 24, 2009, CDC uploaded complete gene sequences of the  2009 H1N1 virus to a publicly-accessible international influenza database,  which enabled scientists around the world to use the sequences for public  health research and for comparison against influenza viruses collected  elsewhere, and an updated report on the outbreak was published online in the  MMWR.</p>

<h3><a name="World_Alerted_To_Public_Health_Emergency" id="World_Alerted_To_Public_Health_Emergency"></a><strong>World  Braces for Possible Pandemic</strong></h3>
<p>On  Saturday, April 25, 2009, under the rules of the International Health  Regulations, <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_20090425/en/index.html">the  Director-General of WHO declared the 2009 H1N1 outbreak a Public Health Emergency  of International Concern</a> and recommended that countries  intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and  severe pneumonia. Also on April 25, 2009, New York City officials reported an  investigation into a cluster of influenza-like illness in a high school, and  CDC testing confirmed two cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in Kansas, and  another case in Ohio shortly after.</p>
<p>  On April 26, 2009, the United States Government determined that a  public health emergency existed nationwide; CDC’s Strategic National Stockpile  (SNS) began releasing 25% of the supplies in the stockpile that could be used  to protect and treat influenza. This included 11 million regimens of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/antiviral.htm">antiviral</a> drugs, and personal protective equipment including over 39  million respiratory protection devices (masks and respirators), gowns, gloves  and face shields, to states (allocations were based on each state’s  population). </p>
<p>As part of the nation’s pre-pandemic planning efforts, by April 2009 the Federal  Government had purchased 50 million treatment courses of antiviral drugs –  oseltamivir and zanamivir – for the SNS, and states had purchased 23 million antiviral  regimens. After the determination of the public  health emergency, FDA also took action to expand possible usage  of antiviral drugs oseltamivir and zanamivir by  issuing <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/eua/qa.htm">Emergency  Use Authorizations (EUAs).</a></p>
<p>  The EUAs allowed for use of the products in a manner different  from what they were FDA-approved for. This included allowing for off-label use  of: </p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>oseltamivir to treat       children younger than 1 year of age and to help prevent influenza in       children 3 months to 1 year of age, and; </li>
  <li>oseltamivir and       zanamivir to treat patients who are symptomatic for more than two days       before initiation of treatment, or who had complicated illness requiring       hospitalization. </li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_20090427/en/index.html">On  April 27, the WHO Director-General raised the level of influenza pandemic alert  from phase 3 to phase 4</a>, based primarily on  epidemiological data demonstrating human-to-human transmission and the ability  of the virus to cause community-level outbreaks. Based on reports of widespread  influenza-like-illness and many severe illnesses and deaths in Mexico, CDC  issued a travel health warning recommending that United States travelers  postpone all non-essential travel to Mexico. As in past influenza  seasons, CDC urged the public and especially those people at highest risk of  influenza-related complications, to protect themselves by taking antiviral drugs  early in their illness when recommended by their doctor; CDC also advised that  everyone take every day preventive actions like covering coughs and sneezes and  staying home from work and school when ill to help reduce the spread of illness.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_20090429/en/index.html">On  April 29, 2009 WHO raised the influenza pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5</a>,  signaling  that a pandemic was imminent, and requested that all countries immediately  activate their pandemic preparedness plans and be on high alert for unusual  outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia. The U.S. Government  was already implementing its pandemic response plan. CDC continued to post and  update <a href="guidance/index.html">guidance</a> for states, clinicians, laboratories, schools, partners and the <a href="general_info.htm">public</a> on topics ranging from the non-pharmaceutical measures communities could take  to limit spread of disease, to how to evaluate a patient for possible infection  with 2009 H1N1 influenza, to how to care for children who might be sick with  2009 H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>  On  April 30, 2009, CDC issued an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0430a2.htm">MMWR  Dispatch describing the initial outbreak of 2009 H1N1 influenza in Mexico</a>.  Findings in Mexico indicated that transmission in Mexico involved person-to-person  spread with multiple generations of transmission. CDC also issued an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0430a1.htm">MMWR  Dispatch on the outbreak of 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in a high school in  New York City, that was, at the time, the largest reported cluster of 2009 H1N1  cases in the United States</a>. The Dispatch suggested that the high  school age students had respiratory and fever symptoms similar to those caused  by a seasonal flu, but in addition, about half had diarrhea, which is more than  expected with seasonal flu. As the details of the outbreak unfolded, the  Federal response continued in high gear. Also on April 30, 2009, <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/04/20090430a.html">HHS  announced that the Federal government would purchase an additional 13 million  treatment courses of antiviral drugs to help fight influenza</a>.  The additional treatment courses would be added to the SNS.</p>
<p>  As  the outbreak spread, CDC began receiving reports of school closures and  implementation of community-level social distancing measures meant to slow the  spread of disease. School administrators and public health officials were  following their pandemic plans and doing everything they could to slow the  spread of illness. (Social  distancing measures are meant to increase distance between people. Measures  include staying home when ill unless to seek medical care, avoiding large  gatherings, telecommuting, and implementing school closures).</p>
<h3><a name="CDC_Laboratories_Bolster_Nations_Testing" id="CDC_Laboratories_Bolster_Nations_Testing"></a><strong>CDC  Laboratories Bolster Nation’s Testing Capacity </strong></h3>
<p>While initial efforts were underway to develop  a safe and effective vaccine to protect people against 2009 H1N1, work also was  being done at CDC to help laboratories supporting health care professionals to  more quickly identify the 2009 H1N1 virus in samples from patients. The  real-time PCR test developed by CDC was cleared for use by diagnostic  laboratories by FDA under an <a href="eua/index.html">Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)</a> on April 28, 2009, less than two weeks  after identification of the new pandemic virus. Prior to the availability of  this EUA, public health laboratories had been able to identify whether  influenza A viruses were seasonal influenza viruses or were a novel strain, but  the new diagnostic kits allowed labs to confirm a virus as 2009 H1N1. On May 1,  2009, CDC test kits began shipping to domestic and international public  health laboratories. (Each test kit contained reagents to  test 1,000 clinical specimens). From May 1 through September 1, 2009, more than 1,000 kits  were shipped to 120 domestic and 250 international laboratories in 140  countries. Once labs had the test kits and verified that their testing was  running properly, they were able to identify new cases more quickly than before  and no longer needed to send samples to CDC for lab confirmation. The  transition away from CDC lab confirmation testing didn’t happen overnight  though - between April 23 and May 31, 2009, CDC influenza laboratory analyzed  about 5,000 influenza virus samples, five times the number that were processed  in a similar timeframe in 2008, and more than during any previous influenza  season. By May 18, 2009, 40 states had been validated  to conduct their own 2009 H1N1 testing, with eight states having multiple  laboratories able to do their own testing. CDC alerted the public that the expansion  in testing capacity would likely result in a jump in the number of 2009 H1N1 cases,  but that this would actually present a more accurate picture of the true scope  of 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States.</p>
<p>  By May 1, 2009, CDC had identified some interesting things about  the 2009 H1N1 virus. </p>
<ul type="circle">
  <li>Researchers had       confirmed earlier testing that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was a       quadruple-reassortant virus, meaning that it contained virus genes that       originated from four different influenza virus sources. Some of the gene       segments originated from North American swine influenza viruses, some gene       segments originated from North American avian influenza viruses, one gene       segment originated from a human influenza virus, and two gene segments       were normally found in swine influenza viruses from Asia and in       Europe.  </li>
  <li>Testing of a number       of the virus samples submitted to CDC showed that they were very similar,       which means they likely originated from the same source.  </li>
  <li>Laboratory testing       showed that the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus did not have any 1918-like       markers that had been associated with increased risk of severe       disease.  </li>
  <li>Testing also did not       find genetic markers that were previously associated with high death rates       in people infected with the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus in other       countries.  </li>
</ul>
<p>On May 4, 2009, CDC shifted from reporting confirmed cases of 2009  H1N1 to reporting both confirmed and probable cases of 2009 H1N1. At that  point, more than 98% of “probable” flu virus samples were testing positive for  2009 H1N1, indicating the ever-growing scale of the outbreak. Probable cases  were reported to CDC by state health departments and occurred in people who  tested positive for influenza A and negative for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and  A(H3N2) subtypes at their state health department laboratory, but whose samples  had not had confirmatory testing for the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus.</p>

<h3><a name="CDC_Shares_Guidance_Personnel_Early_Res" id="CDC_Shares_Guidance_Personnel_Early_Res"></a><strong>CDC Shares Personnel, Guidance, Early Results of Studies</strong></h3>
<p>CDC deployed a large number of  staff to the field to support the outbreak response; by May 1, 2009, 50 staff  people were deployed, and that number climbed to more than 100 by May 11, 2009,  before gradually declining as field teams returned from deployment to complete  studies, analyze collected data, and help inform policy decisions for the  prevention and control of 2009 H1N1 influenza. Over the course of the outbreak,   more  than 3,300 people from  throughout CDC would support the response.</p>
<p>  On May 6, 2009, CDC distributed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/recommendations.htm">recommendations for  the use of influenza antiviral medicines</a> to provide  guidance for clinicians in prescribing antiviral medicines for treatment and  prevention (chemoprophylaxis) of 2009 H1N1 influenza. CDC recommended that  testing and antiviral treatment be prioritized for people with severe  respiratory illness and people at high risk of complications from seasonal  influenza. This included children younger than 5 years old, pregnant women,  people with chronic medical conditions, and people 65 years and older.</p>
<p>  On May 8, 2009, CDC issued an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5817a1.htm">MMWR updating the situations in Mexico, the United  States, and worldwide</a>, and  on May 15, 2009, CDC’s <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/">Travel Health</a> Warning recommending against non-essential travel to Mexico, in  effect since April 27, 2009, was downgraded to a Travel Health Precaution for  Mexico.</p>
<p>  By this point in the outbreak,  about half of all influenza viruses being detected through laboratory  surveillance were 2009 H1N1 viruses, with the other half being regular seasonal  influenza viruses, including seasonal influenza A H1N1, influenza A H3N2 and  type B viruses. Surveillance reports indicated that the largest number of 2009  H1N1 influenza confirmed and probable cases (about 57% of cases) were occurring  among people between 5 years and 24 years of age, and 41% of the  hospitalizations were occurring among older children and young adults. The  highest rates of hospitalization were among children younger than 5 years of age; the next highest hospitalization rate was in people 5 years to  24 years of age. Based  on data from previous influenza pandemics and seasonal influenza, pregnant  women had been recognized as a high-risk group early in the outbreak. Early  data on 2009 H1N1 illness among pregnant women was reported in an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5818a3.htm">article</a> published as an MMWR Dispatch on May 12, 2009. This article  emphasized the importance of empiric treatment (treatment without confirmatory  testing) of pregnant women suspected to have 2009 H1N1. People with other  previously recognized medical conditions that placed them at high risk of  complications from seasonal influenza also appeared to be at increased risk of  complications from 2009 H1N1 influenza. In this report, seventy-one percent (71%) of  hospitalized patients had one or more underlying chronic medical conditions.  Reported deaths had occurred in people ranging in age from 22 months old to 57  years old. Also, only 13% of hospitalizations had occurred in people 50 years  and older, and there were few cases and no deaths in people older than 65  years, which was unusual when compared with seasonal flu.</p>
<p>  Early results of an <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5819a1.htm">antibody  study conducted by CDC</a> indicated that children had no existing cross-reactive antibody to the 2009  H1N1 influenza virus, while about one-third of adults older than 60 years of  age had cross-reactive antibody against the 2009 H1N1 flu virus. One possible  explanation for this pre-existing antibody in older adults was that they may  have had previous exposure, either through infection or vaccination, to an influenza  A H1N1 virus that was more closely related to the 2009 H1N1 flu virus than  contemporary seasonal influenza A (H1N1) viruses are. Data from a similar study <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5819a1.htm">suggested that seasonal  influenza vaccine would not provide any significant protection against 2009  H1N1 influenza virus</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="A_Pandemic_Is_Declared" id="A_Pandemic_Is_Declared"></a><strong>A Pandemic is Declared</strong></h3>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/statements/2009/h1n1_pandemic_phase6_20090611/en/index.html">On  June 11, 2009, WHO signaled that a global pandemic of 2009 H1N1 influenza was  underway</a> by further raising the worldwide pandemic alert level  to <a href="http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/">Phase 6<img border="0" width="10" height="10" src="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/cdcresponse_clip_image002.gif" alt="External Web Site Icon" /></a>. That  day, CDC held its first press conference with the new CDC Director Thomas  Frieden, MD, MPH. The press conference had a total of 2,355 participants. At  the time, more than 70 countries had reported cases of 2009 H1N1 infection, and  community level outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 were ongoing in multiple parts of the  world. The WHO decision to raise the pandemic alert level to Phase 6 was a  reflection of spread of the virus in other parts of the world and not a  reflection of any change in the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus or associated  illness. To date, most people in the United States who had become ill with 2009  H1N1 influenza had not become seriously ill and had recovered without  hospitalization.</p>
<p>  After the WHO declaration of a pandemic on June 11, the 2009 H1N1  virus continued to spread and the number of countries reporting cases of 2009  H1N1 nearly doubled from mid-June 2009 to early July 2009. Significant levels  of 2009 H1N1 illness continued, with localized and in some cases intense  outbreaks occurring. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/061909.htm">By June 19, 2009</a>, all 50 states in the United States, the District of Columbia,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands had reported cases of 2009 H1N1  infection. The United States continued to report the largest number of 2009  H1N1 cases of any country worldwide, although most people who became ill  recovered without requiring medical treatment. By late June more  than 30 summer camps in the U.S. had reported outbreaks of 2009 H1N1 influenza  illness, and CDC released guidance for day and residential camps to reduce the  spread of influenza. At the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/acip/downloads/min-jun09.pdf">June  25, 2009 Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices Meeting</a>,  CDC estimated that at least 1 million cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza had occurred  in the United States.</p>
<p>  In early July, 2009, three 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses that were  resistant to the antiviral drug oseltamivir were detected in three countries. (Antiviral  resistance is when a virus changes in such a way that the antiviral drug is  less effective in treating or preventing illnesses caused by the virus.) CDC  and WHO partners continued to conduct surveillance for antiviral resistance,  although instances of antiviral resistance continued to be detected very  rarely.</p>
<p>  Also in July 2009, CDC reported findings in the MMWR that  indicated <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5827a4.htm">a  striking prevalence of obesity in intensive care patients who were confirmed to  have 2009 H1N1 influenza</a>. Throughout the pandemic,  CDC would continue to examine the relationship between 2009 H1N1 influenza,  obesity, severe disease and other underlying risk factors.</p>
<p>  CDC continued to work with the Council of State and Territorial  Epidemiologists (CSTE) to enhance surveillance for 2009 H1N1 influenza. As 2009  H1N1 cases continued to occur through the spring and summer, the task of  counting cases became increasingly difficult. On May 12, 2009, CDC transitioned  from reporting individual confirmed and probable cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza  to reporting aggregate counts of 2009 H1N1 lab confirmed and probable cases, hospitalizations  and deaths with the launch of an aggregate reporting web site. Once the numbers  of cases increased beyond the point where counting of individual cases was  practical, on July 23, 2009, CDC reported the number of 2009 cases for the last  time. Reporting of 2009 H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths continued. In  addition, CDC continued using its traditional surveillance systems to track the  progress of the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak. Traditional surveillance systems  do not count individual cases, but instead monitor activity levels and virus  characteristics through a nationwide surveillance system.</p>
<p>  CDC worked closely with countries in the Southern Hemisphere to  monitor and enhance surveillance for influenza viruses throughout the summer  months. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/updates/061909.htm">Southern  Hemisphere’s</a> influenza season began in May  2009 and countries there reported that 2009 H1N1 virus was spreading and  causing illness along with regular seasonal influenza viruses. <a href="http://www.flu.gov/professional/global/southhemisphere.html">After  mid-July</a>, disease activity in most countries  decreased, and by November, temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere were  reporting very little 2009 H1N1 disease activity. In general, the experience of the Southern  Hemisphere with the 2009 H1N1 virus was similar to what is usually seen during  a regular influenza season and did not seem to excessively impact the health  care systems in the Southern Hemisphere. Also, surveillance systems did not find significant changes in the  2009 H1N1 influenza viruses circulating in the Southern Hemisphere as compared  to viruses isolated from people in the Northern Hemisphere. These findings  provided the U.S. with valuable clues related to what the 2009-2010 influenza  season in the United States might be like. Importantly, the lack of significant  changes in the virus indicated that the 2009 H1N1 vaccine being manufactured  would closely match the currently circulating 2009 H1N1 viruses and likely provide  people with good protection against 2009 H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p class="topofpage"><a href="cdcresponse.htm#top"><img src="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/images/top.gif" width="40" height="15" border="0" alt="top of page" /></a></p>
<h3><a name="Ongoing_Surveillance_And_Response" id="Ongoing_Surveillance_And_Response"></a><strong>Ongoing  Surveillance &amp; Response</strong></h3>
<p>2009 H1N1 influenza summer activity peaked in  the United States during May and June and declined during July and early  August. However, levels of influenza activity would remain above normal  throughout the summer months with localized outbreaks. During the last two  weeks of August, 2009 H1N1 influenza activity again began to increase United  States.</p>
<p>  In  August 2009, CDC reported an additional <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58d0814a1.htm">two  instances of oseltamivir-resistant virus infection in two immunosuppressed  patients in Seattle, Washington</a>. Later, in mid-September,  CDC reported <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5835a1.htm">two  additional cases of oseltamivir-resistant 2009 H1N1 influenza in two summer  campers in North Carolina</a>. CDC and partners continued to  carefully track 2009 H1N1 influenza antiviral resistance. As of June 2010 the  2009 H1N1 virus remains susceptible to the <a href="antivirals.1.html">antiviral drugs</a> oseltamivir and zanamivir, with rare exception. Cases of  antiviral resistance are carefully tracked and updated numbers are posted each  week as part of the CDC publication <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm">FluView</a>.</p>
<p>  In  late August, CDC began working with the commercial supply chain (manufacturers,  distributors, retailers) for certain influenza countermeasures to monitor national  inventory levels of critical supplies (antivirals and respiratory protective  equipment) on a weekly basis. This visibility provided important data to guide  SNS decision-making leading to the release of additional SNS countermeasures.</p>
<p>  FDA  and the manufacturer of the antiviral drug Tamiflu® (oseltamivir) recognized  that commercial and stockpiled supplies of Tamiflu® oral suspension (liquid  formulation meant for children) were limited in October 2009. CDC worked with  partners to reach <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/pharmacist/">pharmacists</a> with background information, updates on antiviral drug supplies, and  instructions on how to compound oral suspension from Tamiflu® capsules meant  for adults (Compounding is the mixing of drugs by a health care professional to  fit the unique needs of the patient). CDC also provided instructions for  parents and caregivers on how to make a medicine mixture for their child using  adult Tamiflu® capsules and thick, sweetened liquid.  CDC also analyzed related surveillance data  and based on the analysis over 500,000 bottles of pediatric oral suspension  were distributed from the CDC SNS to states to fill production gaps and meet  the increasing demand for the formulation.</p>
<p>  On October 23rd, 2009, FDA  issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Peramivir IV. Peramivir IV is  an investigational intravenous antiviral drug used to treat people who have  been hospitalized due to severe flu illness. This drug was held in the  Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) and distributed by CDC under an EUA.  Licensed clinicians were able to request this product through the CDC website  electronic request system, and product was delivered directly to hospital  facilities. Also in October, HHS authorized the release of an additional 59.5  million N95 respirators.</p>
<p>  CDC closed out reports of 2009 H1N1 hospitalizations and deaths  for the 2008-09 season in late August. On August 30, 2009, reporting  modifications were implemented to allow states to report hospitalizations and  deaths associated with any influenza or to report hospitalizations and deaths  using a pneumonia and influenza syndromic case definition through the Aggregate  Hospitalizations and Deaths Reporting Activity (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/flu_surv_ahdra.htm">AHDRA</a>). This change in reporting was implemented in order to provide a  fuller picture of the burden of serious flu illness and deaths during the  pandemic. The new reporting season for the 2009-2010 flu season  began on August 30, 2009, and the first new numbers for the 2009-2010 season  were reported in the September 11, 2009 issue of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/fluactivity.htm">FluView</a>.</p>
<p>  Over  the course of the pandemic, CDC refined and revised its surveillance methods,  eventually developing a methodology based on surveillance data to estimate the  range of 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States. CDC  released its first official estimates for 2009 H1N1 cases, hospitalizations and  deaths on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_October_17.htm">November  12, 2009</a>, and updated these on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_November_14.htm">December  10, 2009</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_December_12.htm">January  15, 2010</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_January_16.htm">February 12, 2010</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/H1N1flu/estimates/April_February_13.htm">March  12, 2010</a>, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/estimates/April_March_13.htm">April  19, 2010</a> and for the final time on <a href="estimates_2009_h1n1.htm">May  14, 2010</a>.</p>
<h3><strong><a name="a_2009_H1N1_Vaccination" id="a_2009_H1N1_Vaccination"></a>2009  H1N1 Vaccination</strong></h3>
<p>The emergence and spread of the 2009 H1N1 virus resulted in  extraordinary influenza-like illness activity in the United States throughout  the summer and fall months of 2009. During this period, influenza activity  reached its highest level in the reporting week ending October 24, 2009, with  49 of 50 states reporting geographically widespread disease. A  cornerstone of the U.S. Government response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was the  launch of the <a href="vaccination/index.html">national  influenza 2009 H1N1 vaccination campaign</a> that began in October.</p>
<p>  Much  activity led up to the launch of the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>  Starting  in early June 2009, weekly calls were held to provide state and local planners  with vaccine-related updates, and on July 8, 2009, CDC issued guidance for  state and local public health departments to assist them in planning for the  2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination campaign. On July 9, 2009, the Department of  Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department  of Education, and the White House held an influenza preparedness summit for  federal, state, local and tribal officials to discuss existing pandemic plans,  lessons learned, and preparedness priorities. At the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2009pres/07/20090709a.html">summit</a>,  the Federal government announced the availability of $350 million in  supplemental funding for use by state, local and territorial health departments  to bolster their response activities to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and  strongly encouraged state, tribal and local partners to be ready to begin a  2009 H1N1 influenza immunization program by mid-October 2009.</p>
<p>  The  2009 National Influenza Vaccine Summit, a partnership of public and private  stakeholders committed to achieving the <em>Healthy  People 2010</em> goals for influenza vaccine, convened on  June 29. During the  2009 Summit, attendees were provided updates by experts in several professional  fields, including private medicine, public health, health communication,  vaccine manufacturing, vaccine distribution, and vaccine-related policy.  CDC has been a cosponsor of this event, along  with the American Medical Association, since 2001.</p>
<p>  In preparation for the 2009 H1N1 influenza immunization program,  on July 22, 2009,  <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/flu/Pages/default.aspx">the  National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced the start of a series of clinical  trials</a> to test pilot lots of two manufacturers’ versions of  2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine in healthy people, as well as people with  underlying health conditions like asthma and HIV. Preliminary  results from the clinical trials were announced publicly.</p>
<p>  On  July 23, 2009, <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/flu/Pages/default.aspx">FDA’s  Vaccines and Related Biological Advisory Committee</a> indicated support of FDA’s proposed plan to license monovalent 2009 H1N1  vaccines via a “strain change” pathway, similar to how seasonal influenza  vaccines are licensed. This meant the 2009 H1N1 vaccine would be made in the  same way using the same standards already in place for seasonal vaccines; it  also allowed licensure to proceed more quickly since it did not require immunogenicity  data or additional safety (except for the live attenuated vaccine) data for  licensure.</p>
<p>  On  July 29, 2009, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) met to  make <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/vaccination/acip.htm">recommendations  for 2009 H1N1 vaccine</a>. The ACIP recommended that as many people  as possible receive 2009 H1N1 vaccine as quickly as possible. Certain groups of  people were targeted to receive initially limited supplies of the 2009 H1N1  vaccine based on epidemiologic and virologic data indicating they were at  higher risk for infection or for severe influenza complications. The initial  target groups for vaccination were estimated to consist of about 159 million people  and included: pregnant women, people who live with or  care for infants younger than 6 months of age, health care and emergency  medical services personnel, infants 6 months through young adults 24 years of  age, and adults 25 through 64 years of age who are at higher risk for 2009 H1N1  complications because of chronic health disorders or compromised immune  systems. The ACIP also recommended that local public health authorities  and health care practitioners have flexibility to determine at the local level  how quickly and when to expand vaccination to other groups because vaccine  availability and demand would likely vary by area.</p>
<p>  CDC  convened three public engagement sessions in mid-August in ten regions of the United  States with the purpose of soliciting citizen input into vaccination planning.  The public provided opinions to CDC regarding how vaccine should be provided in  the U.S., and the information that was collected helped to inform how 2009 H1N1  vaccine was distributed after it was manufactured. Ultimately, it was decided  that vaccine should be distributed as soon as it was ready so that people could  be protected against influenza as soon as possible, versus waiting to  distribute vaccine until large quantities were prepared.</p>
<p>  In late August, CDC published a study in the MMWR that summarized an investigation of <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5833a1.htm">laboratory-confirmed  cases of 2009 H1N1 influenza identified during April 24-July 25, 2009 in  Chicago, Illinois</a>. The study found that the  overall attack rate was highest among children aged 5-14 years (147 per 100,000  population), which was 14 times higher than for adults older than 60 years of  age. A total of 205 (13%) patients were hospitalized, with the highest rate  observed among children aged 0-4 years (25 per 100,000), followed by children  aged 5-14 years (11 per 100,000). These findings would also provide input into  vaccination strategy.</p>
<p>  By  the end of August 2009, prototype vaccines to prevent 2009 H1N1 virus had been  developed but were not yet licensed. Production of the enormous quantities of  vaccine necessary to protect the entire U.S. population was underway. CDC  expanded its contract for  the childhood Vaccine for Children program in the United States (McKesson  Specialty Distribution), to provide centralized distribution of 2009 H1N1  vaccine. Available vaccine supplies were allocated to states proportional to  their total populations and shipped to public and private provider vaccination  sites based on orders placed by the states. Participating providers were asked  to sign a Provider Agreement assuring they intended to meet state requirements  for administering vaccine.</p>
<p>  On  September 3, 2009, CDC published in the MMWR <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5834a1.htm">a  study that had analyzed data related to 2009 H1N1 influenza pediatric deaths  reported to CDC from April to August, 2009</a>. Data showed that  as of August 8, 2009, 477 deaths with laboratory confirmed 2009 H1N1 flu in the  United States had been reported to CDC, including 36 children younger than 18  years of age. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of children who died with 2009 H1N1  influenza had at least one high-risk medical condition. CDC continued to urge  parents to recognize 2009 H1N1 in their children early and to seek medical  attention when needed. CDC also reiterated that all children 6 months or older  and caregivers of children younger than 6 months should receive the 2009 H1N1  vaccine when it became available.</p>
<p>  On  September 10, 2009, the HHS Secretary and CDC Director joined the National  Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) in a news conference to stress  vigilance against seasonal influenza in an unusual season and urged Americans  to get their seasonal flu vaccine early. In addition to NFID, HHS and CDC, the  news conference was held in collaboration with the American Medical Association  (AMA), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American College of Physicians  (ACP), AARP, and the National Influenza Vaccine Summit.</p>
<p class="topofpage"><a href="cdcresponse.htm#top"><img src="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/images/top.gif" width="40" height="15" border="0" alt="top of page" /></a></p>
<p>  On  September 15, 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its <a href="http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm182399.htm">approval  of four 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccines</a>, and later, on November  16, FDA announced its <a href="http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm190783.htm">approval  of a fifth 2009 H1N1 vaccine</a> to protect against the  2009 H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>  The  NIH announced on September 21, 2009, that early <a href="http://www3.niaid.nih.gov/news/newsreleases/2009/H1N1PedTrial.htm">results  from clinical trials</a> of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine in children  looked promising. Preliminary analysis indicated that the vaccines were safe,  and that only one dose of 2009 H1N1 vaccine for the majority of 10 to 17 year  olds would be needed to generate a sufficient immune response to be protective  against 2009 H1N1 influenza virus, but younger children generally had a less  robust early response to the vaccine. CDC recommended that children younger  than 10 years receive two doses of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. <a href="http://content.nejm.org/content/vol361/issue25/index.dtl">Results  of trials conducted among adults</a> were later published in  December, and the data indicated that the immune response among vaccinated  adults was excellent. The safety data from these trials also indicated that  vaccine side effects were similar to those seen with the seasonal flu vaccines.</p>
<p>  On  September 30, 2009, states were able to place their first orders for the 2009  H1N1 vaccine; forty-seven states placed orders on that day, and by October 9,  2009, all states and the District of Columbia had placed orders for vaccine.  The first doses were administered on October 5, 2009.</p>
<p>  Because  initial supplies of vaccine were limited, most state and local health  departments requested that vaccine be given only to those in the initial target  groups, and many restricted use to those in sub prioritization groups that had  also been outlined by ACIP. The first six weeks after vaccines were initially  released where characterized by high demand for vaccine and limited  availability. On October 23, the ACIP discussed pandemic vaccine issues,  including suitability of the initial target groups developed in July 2009, and  concluded that the July guidance remained appropriate. The ACIP continued to  emphasize the role of local decision-making in determining when to begin  offering vaccine to persons outside initial target groups.</p>
<p>  As  vaccine supply increased, by late November and early December most states had  begun easing restrictions for 2009 H1N1 vaccine use, and by late December vaccination  had been opened up to anyone who wanted it. Also beginning in December 2009,  the HHS Center for Faith-Based Neighborhood Partnerships partnered with the HHS  Regional Offices to host eleven teleconferences to engage community and  faith-based organizations in the 2009 H1N1 flu response. Since most states were  easing vaccination restrictions, these calls presented an opportunity to remind  key partners that they should check with their local health departments to  determine availability of vaccine. By the week of  December 22, distribution of 2009  H1N1 vaccine had been opened up to retail pharmacies so that they could place  orders for vaccine directly, thereby expanding the reach and availability of  vaccine.</p>
<p>  In  December 2009, CDC published in the MMWR <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm58e1204a1.htm">preliminary  safety results for the 2009 H1N1 vaccines</a> from the first  months of reports received through the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting  System (VAERS), a national voluntary reporting surveillance system and data  from the Vaccine Safety Datalink. Results indicated that the vast majority  (95%) of adverse events reported to VAERS after receipt of the 2009 H1N1  vaccine were not serious (e.g., soreness at the vaccine injection site). Of the  3,783 reports, 204 (5%) were reports that involved what would be coded as serious  health events (defined as life threatening or resulting in death, major  disability, abnormal conditions at birth, hospitalization, or extension of an  existing hospitalization). The percentage of reports involving what would be  considered serious health events was not substantially different between 2009  H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccines.</p>
<p>  The  2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine was manufactured in several formulations, using the same manufacturers and the same manufacturing  practices used to produce seasonal influenza vaccine. Monitoring the safety of  the flu vaccine continues to be a top priority. CDC and the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) worked with other agencies to establish and enhance  existing surveillance systems to rapidly detect any unexpected adverse events  among persons who are vaccinated and to adjust the vaccination program, if  necessary, to minimize risks and maximize benefits from vaccination. Two important  systems used to monitor vaccine safety that have been active for 20 years, are  the <a href="http://vaers.hhs.gov/index">Vaccine Adverse Events  Reporting System (VAERS)</a>, jointly operated between CDC and  FDA, and the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/VSD.html">Vaccine  Safety Datalink (VSD) </a>, a collaborative project between the  CDC and eight managed care organizations covering more than nine million  members(about 3% of the US population). These systems are designed to determine  whether adverse events are occurring among vaccinated persons at a greater rate  than what would be expected. CDC worked with FDA and other partners to  strengthen these vaccine safety monitoring systems and develop new ways to  monitor vaccine safety. In addition, based on the recommendation of the <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/nvpo/nvac/reports/index.html">National Vaccine  Advisory Committee</a> (NVAC), HHS established the H1N1 Vaccine  Safety Risk Assessment Working Group to review 2009 H1N1 vaccine safety data as  it accumulates. This working group of outside experts conducts regular, rapid  reviews of available data from the federal safety monitoring systems and  presents them to NVAC and federal leadership for appropriate policy action and  follow-up.</p>
<p>  Also  in December 2009, HHS joined with the Ad Council to launch a new nationwide  Public Service Announcements campaign called <em>Together We Can Fight the Flu</em> that encouraged Americans to get  vaccinated against the 2009 H1N1 virus. The week of December 18, 2009 marked  the first 100 million doses of 2009 H1N1 vaccine available for ordering.</p>
<p>  The year 2010 began with the National  Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW). NIVW is a national observance that was  established to highlight the importance of continuing influenza vaccination  after the holiday season into January and beyond. The President of the United  States proclaimed the week of January 10-16, 2010, National Influenza  Vaccination Week, and encouraged all Americans to observe the week by getting  the 2009 H1N1 flu vaccine and by asking their families, friends and coworkers  to do the same. CDC and HHS - in conjunction with the states and many other  partners, both public and private - launched a comprehensive NIVW campaign with  the objective of raising vaccination awareness, providing educational  opportunities, free resources, as well as vaccination clinics. Every year,  certain days during NIVW are designated to highlight the importance for certain  groups; this year’s Week was dedicated to highlighting the importance of  vaccination for the general public and health care workers, people with chronic  health conditions that put them at high risk of serious influenza-related  complications, children, pregnant women, and caregivers of infants less than 6  months old, young adults 19 through 24 years old, and people 65 years and older.  For example, the events on Tuesday, January 12 centered on people with chronic  medical conditions that put them at higher risk of serious influenza-related  complications. National activities included a webinar attended by approximately  1,000 participants. This joint effort was hosted by HHS, CDC, the American  Cancer Society, the American Diabetes Association, and the American Lung  Association. In addition, Secretary Sebelius participated in two press  conference calls announcing new public service announcements (PSAs) tailored to  African American and Native American audiences. The Director of the Indian  Health Service joined the Secretary in stressing the importance and benefits of  vaccination.</p>
<p>  On January 15, 2010, CDC published an  article in the MMWR on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm59e0115a1.htm">influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccination  coverage in the United States between October and December 2009</a>. Results of the study indicated that  efforts to get available vaccine to target groups had largely succeeded. Early on  during the 3-month period, 85% of available vaccine reached people within those  initial target populations. By the end of December, with many programs  expanding their vaccine efforts to all populations, 74% of all vaccine given  during the program had gone to people in the initial priority groups.</p>
<p>  On February 18, 2010, the World  Health Organization (WHO) published recommendations for the composition of  influenza virus vaccines for the upcoming season in the Northern Hemisphere  (November 2010-April 2011). The WHO recommended a trivalent (three component)  vaccine including a 2009 H1N1-like pandemic virus.  In February of 2010, the components of the 2010-2011 influenza vaccine were announced. The 2010-2011 flu  vaccine will protect against a 2009 H1N1-like virus in addition to an influenza  A H3N2 virus and an influenza B virus.</p>
<p>  The United States experienced its second wave of 2009 H1N1  activity in the fall with activity peaking during the second week in October.  After that, activity declined quickly to below baseline levels in January, but  persisted for several more months at lower levels. However, by May, influenza  activity levels in the United States were low across key flu indicators.  Reporting for the 2009-2010 influenza season was finalized on May 28, 2010.  Even as flu activity reached normal summer-time levels in the U.S., CDC  continued to recommend influenza vaccination, particularly for high risk  persons, because of reports of ongoing sporadic cases of 2009 H1N1, ongoing  spread of 2009 H1N1 in the Southern Hemisphere and the possibility that 2009  H1N1 viruses might circulate early during the upcoming flu season.</p>

<h3><a name="CDC_Communication_Activities" id="CDC_Communication_Activities"></a><strong>CDC  Communication Activities During the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic</strong><br />
  
</h3>
<p>The  CDC response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was led by science and continually  evolved to meet the nation’s needs as events unfolded and as more information  became available. However, a consistent underlying communications strategy  underscored the entire CDC response. The strategy is based on the emergency  risk communications principles of quickly, proactively and transparently  communicating accurate information to the public and to partners. This strategy  included CDC clearly stating its goals and actions in response to the evolving  situation and acknowledging what was <strong>not</strong> known, as well as what was known. Another important part of the strategy was  CDC setting the expectation that information and advice would change rapidly as  the situation evolved. From the earliest days of the pandemic, CDC regularly  articulated its goals to “reduce transmission and  illness severity, and provide information to help health care providers, public  health officials and the public address the challenges posed by the new virus.”  Throughout the response, in an effort to provide the most helpful information in  the most effective ways possible, CDC drew on existing knowledge but also  worked with partners to conduct ongoing scientific research and evaluation of  people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices related to a number of topics  including 2009 H1N1 flu, infection control guidance, and vaccine.</p>
<p>  Especially  during the early days of the outbreak, the release of information from CDC and  exchange of information with partners was conducted on a 24-hour cycle. This  included frequent updates to media and the public, the consistent use of a core  group of spokespersons, daily information outreach to partners, and rapid  establishment and ongoing maintenance of an extensive Web site dedicated  specifically to the emergency response for 2009 H1N1 flu. The goal was not only  to be as transparent as possible in all activities related to managing the  public health response, but also to maintain credibility and continue to be a  trusted source of information for the public and for partners.</p>
<p>  Beginning  early in the response and continuing throughout the year and into 2010, special  care was taken to keep state and local public health partners informed of CDC’s  activities. Key messages were regularly provided to help maintain consistent,  clear communication across the response. Special care also was taken to  regularly collect feedback from state and local public health partners to help  ensure that CDC recommendations were finely tuned to what was happening in the  field. Regularly scheduled  conference calls with the Association of State and Territorial Health  Officials, the National Association of City and County Health Officials, and  the National Public Health Information Coalition proved to be an effective way to share information. In addition, on April 24,  2009, CDC held the first of more than 30 Clinician Outreach and Communication  Activity (COCA) calls presented on a variety of 2009 H1N1-related topics. COCA  is designed to reach a diverse group of health care providers and provide a  system through which clinicians can communicate their educational needs to CDC  and receive answers to questions about related emerging diseases.  At the peak of the 2009 H1N1 response, COCA had more than 41,100 listserv subscribers.</p>
<p>  CDC  also worked hard to keep the policy community informed.  CDC provided responses to congressional  requests for information and briefings on 2009 H1N1-related issues, and also  provided email and web-based informational updates as the pandemic  unfolded.  In all, CDC participated in 14  hearings, provided technical assistance in another 12 hearings, issued over three  dozen 2009 H1N1 newsletters to policymakers, arranged for over 40 congressional  briefings or speaking engagements and fielded over 350 congressional inquiries  during the pandemic.</p>
<p>  There was a concerted effort to get information out as soon as  possible and to keep the public and partners aware of developments as they  unfolded, even as guidance was changing quickly. For example, when relatively  few cases of human infection with this virus were lab confirmed and severity of  the pandemic was not known, on April 28, 2009, CDC posted guidance for schools  and advised that they close if they had a suspected or actual case of the flu  in order to lessen the risk of spreading 2009 H1N1 into their communities. As  more information became available suggesting a lower risk of severe illness and  death from 2009 H1N1, six days later the recommendation was changed to  recommend against school closure for community mitigation purposes.</p>
<p>  The development of CDC guidance is an example of  the collaborative communication and sharing of information that took place  between CDC, HHS, other federal agencies, and external partners. Development of  appropriate guidance often relied on CDC communication with many external partners  several times a week, with the goal of achieving consensus on what the best  practice would be given the best science currently available. For example, CDC  worked with   representatives from a number of organizations including but not limited  to <a href="http://www.cste.org/dnn/">Council  of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE),</a> <a href="http://www.naccho.org/">National Association of County and City Health  Officials (NAACHO), </a><a href="http://www.aap.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)</a>, <a href="http://www.aafp.org/online/en/home.html">American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP)</a>, <a href="http://www.acog.org">American College  of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), </a><a href="http://www.astho.org/">Association of  State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO)</a>,  <a href="http://www.acponline.org/">American  College of Physicians (ACP)</a>, <a href="http://www.idsociety.org/">Infectious Diseases Society of America (ISDA)</a>, <a href="http://www.aap.org/">American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)</a>, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/">Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </a>and <a href="http://www.who.int/">World Health Organization (WHO)</a>, during the development of guidance related to everything from surveillance systems to the appropriate use of antiviral drugs during the pandemic. On the topic of vaccination, these discussions helped inform decision-making by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).</p>
<p> Apart from ongoing collaboration between CDC and its external  partners, the communications response for 2009 H1N1 flu also was characterized  by ongoing, close coordination between CDC’s  communicators and its scientists to ensure that messages stayed scientifically  accurate. Also, CDC communicators took time to regularly analyze feedback from a variety of   external sources, including polls and surveys, in order to ensure that CDC's messages were clear.</p>
<p>  CDC provided a steady stream of information to audiences across the  spectrum: from the public to pharmacists to laboratorians to international  partners and countries around the globe. Information provided by CDC reached a  myriad of audiences through a variety of channels including but not limited to:  a 24-hour information hotline, press briefings for the media, dissemination  through health alert networks, daily postings (including video and audio  podcasts) to the CDC 2009 H1N1 web site, regular updates on Facebook and  Twitter, and further outreach by partners and partner organizations to their  own audiences, just to name a few channels.   For example, in November 2009, CDC kicked off a national travelers’  health public awareness campaign and urged travelers to plan ahead and stay  informed about what to do if they got sick while they were away from home. The  campaign used a variety of media, including informational posters distributed  at over 300 ports of entry in the United States, national radio and print  advertising, and social media and online outreach, which culminated in over 80  million exposures.  CDC also coordinated  with HHS and the Flu.gov web site and posted communication  toolkits for the 2009-2010 influenza season for businesses, employers,  childcare groups and institutions of higher education.</p>
<p>  The CDC 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza vaccination  campaign was made up of multiple outreach efforts including placement of  articles geared to numerous audiences like parents and young adults, in  high-profile media outlets. Article placements led to nearly 403 million  overall impressions. Other national outreach efforts made via social media  tools, radio ads, two television public service announcements (PSAs), online  media banners, and city bus ads. Numerous print materials in multiple languages  were made for partners to distribute and were downloaded tens of thousands of  times. Special audiences identified for additional print materials included  Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanics, pregnant women, young adults,  first responders, and health care workers.</p>
<p>  In addition to materials provided for  the 2009 H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination  campaign, CDC provided other key materials in multiple languages. For example,  the entire English-language 2009 H1N1 web site was mirrored in Spanish. In  addition, key tools and resources were created in Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean,  French, German, Arabic, Russian, Amharic, Farsi, Somali, Karen, Burmese,  Cambodian, and Kirundi.  </p>
<p>In all, between April  2009 when 2009 H1N1 flu first emerged and April 2010, CDC held 60 related media  events – 39 press briefings and 22 telebriefings – for a total of more than  35,000 participants. CDC also hosted its first ever two-day workshop for the  news media on the subjects of both 2009 H1N1 influenza and seasonal influenza  in late August. Originally conceived to include 12 members of the news media,  the attendance grew to over 40 journalists from national, regional and local  news outlets representing radio, television, newspapers, magazines, and online  news media. Speakers at the event included the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the CDC Director, influenza experts, vaccine safety experts, and  laboratory experts.   The CDC hotline  (1-800-CDC-INFO) responded to more than 211,000 related inquiries from the  general public and health care providers, and the CDC 2009 H1N1 web site had  more than 219,595,000 page views. Also, the number of CDC Facebook fans rose to  more than 55,000 fans and the CDC emergency profile on Twitter was tracked by  more than 1,200,000 followers.</p>
