<h2>October 29, 2013</h2>

<h4>Final Case Count Update</h4>

<p>Reported cases of cyclosporiasis in the United States have returned to baseline levels; therefore, it is likely that the outbreaks identified during June–August 2013 have ended. The number of reports of persons with illness increased beginning in June and returned to baseline in mid-to-late August, as shown in the <a href="investigation-2013-epicurve.html">epidemic curve</a> (epi curve).</p>

<p>A total of 631 persons with cyclosporiasis were reported from 25 states and New York City: Arkansas (16), California (1), Connecticut (2), Florida (33), Georgia (5), Illinois (14), Iowa (140), Kansas (4), Louisiana (3), Massachusetts (3), Michigan (1), Minnesota (3), Missouri (5), Nebraska (87), New Hampshire (1), New Jersey (4), New York City (8), New York State (2), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (1), Texas (270), Virginia (4), Wisconsin (18), and Wyoming (1).</p>

<p>Illness onset dates ranged from June 1, 2013, to August 29, 2013. Ill persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 94 years, with a median age of 52 years. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of ill persons were female. Among 596 persons for whom information was available, 49 (8%) reported being hospitalized, and no deaths were reported.</p>

<p>This outbreak appears to be over. More information about <em>Cyclospora</em> can be found on <a href="../index.html">CDC's </a><em><a href="../index.html">Cyclospora</a></em><a href="../index.html"> pages</a>.</p>

<h4>Investigations in Iowa and Nebraska</h4>

<p>On July 30, 2013, public health officials in the states of Iowa and Nebraska announced that their analysis indicated that restaurant-associated cases of cyclosporiasis in their states were linked to a salad mix. According to FDA, a traceback investigation confirmed that the salad mix identified by Iowa and Nebraska was supplied to restaurants in those states by Taylor Farms de Mexico, a processor of foodservice salads. <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm361637.htm#updates">According to FDA</a>, the restaurants in Iowa and Nebraska included Olive Garden and Red Lobster, both of which are owned by Darden Restaurants.</p>

<h4>Investigations in Texas</h4>

<p>State and local public health and regulatory officials in Texas, the FDA, and CDC conducted epidemiologic and traceback investigations in Texas. The investigations were conducted at three Mexican-style restaurants and one grocery store location where multiple unrelated ill persons reported having eaten or shopped. Preliminary traceback information indicated that some illnesses among Texas residents were <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm361637.htm#updates">linked to fresh cilantro</a> from Puebla, Mexico.</p>

<h4>Ongoing Traceback Activities</h4>

<p>FDA is working with Mexican authorities to collect records to determine if there is a common farm or growing area in Puebla, Mexico, that could have provided fresh cilantro to the three restaurants and the grocery store location associated with clusters of ill persons in Texas.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>

<p>The findings in the investigations suggest that there was more than one outbreak of cyclosporiasis during June–August 2013 in the United States. Restaurant-associated illnesses in Iowa and Nebraska were linked to salad mix from Taylor Farms de Mexico in Guanajuato, Mexico. Some illnesses in Texas were linked to fresh cilantro from Puebla, Mexico.</p>

<p>As in 2013 and <a href="../publications.html#mmwr">in years past</a>, most detected cases and outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in the United States have occurred in spring and summer months, and not all cases during the same time of year are necessarily caused by the same exposure. For example, during a several-month period in 1997, there were three separate and unrelated outbreaks of cyclosporiasis caused by different fresh produce items from various sources. Strong evidence from epidemiologic investigations led to the recognition that the outbreaks were separate and unrelated.</p>

<p>CDC and other institutions are working to develop <a href="../../../amd/index.html">advanced molecular detection methods</a> for <em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em> that could distinguish among strains of this parasite. In the future, DNA fingerprinting methods could help public health investigators determine whether cases of cyclosporiasis are linked to each other and to particular food items/sources.</p>

    	<div class="syndicate"><div class="mSyndicate"><h2>October 23, 2013</h2><h3>Investigation Update</h3><p>Reported cases of cyclosporiasis in the United States have returned to baseline levels; therefore, it is likely that the outbreaks identified during June&#8211;August 2013 have ended. The number of reports of persons with illness increased beginning in June and returned to baseline in mid-to-late August.</p><h4>Investigations in Texas</h4><p>Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by state and local public health and regulatory officials in Texas, the FDA, and CDC indicate that some illnesses among Texas residents were linked to fresh cilantro from Puebla, Mexico.</p><p>Investigating &quot;clusters of illnesses&quot; can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. A cluster of illnesses is defined as more than one unrelated ill person (i.e., they do not know or live with each other) who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store before becoming ill. If several unrelated ill persons ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there. In addition, traceback of suspected food items to identify a common point of contamination may be facilitated by records kept at these locations. Investigators identified more than 70 clusters of illnesses in Texas. Most of the clusters identified in Texas involved two or three ill persons.</p><p>During interviews with ill persons in Texas, about 50% reported having eaten fresh cilantro 2&#8211;14 days before they became ill. This proportion was significantly higher than that reported among ill persons in Iowa and Nebraska (reported by about 10%), and significantly higher than results from a previously conducted <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/surveys/FNExpAtl03022011.pdf">survey of healthy persons</a> in New Mexico where 27% reported eating fresh cilantro in the 7 days before they were interviewed.</p><p>Epidemiologic and traceback investigations were conducted at three restaurants and one grocery store location in Texas, where multiple unrelated ill persons reported having eaten or shopped.</p><h5>Restaurant Cluster Investigations in Texas</h5><p>Thirty (30) ill persons reported eating at a single Mexican-style restaurant in Fort Bend County, Texas, in the 2&#8211;14 days before onset of illness. In this investigation, a case was defined as having onset of diarrhea (&#8805;3 loose stools in a 24-hour period) 2&#8211;14 days after eating at this restaurant. Twenty-two (22) ill persons had laboratory-confirmed <em>Cyclospora</em> infection (confirmed cases) and 8 were probable case-patients (case symptoms but no laboratory confirmation). An analytic epidemiologic study was conducted that compared foods eaten at the restaurant by 25 of the persons who became ill versus 65 healthy persons who remained well. Ingredient-level analyses were conducted using meal consumption data and recipes. Four fresh produce ingredients were significantly associated with illness: cilantro, whole onions, garlic, and tomatoes. Since these ingredients were served together in many different dishes, such as salsa, the statistical analysis could not definitively identify which of these ingredients was independently associated with illness. However, fresh cilantro was the only ingredient consumed by all 25 ill persons in this study. In addition, salsa containing fresh raw (uncooked) cilantro was associated with illness, while salsa containing cooked cilantro was not. Fresh cilantro was used in four types of restaurant-produced salsas. The three salsas that were not cooked were significantly associated with illness, whereas the one that was cooked before serving was not (heat can kill <em>Cyclospora</em>).</p><p>Consumption of lettuce was not associated with illness in this analysis, and traceback information indicated that lettuce served in this restaurant was not from Taylor Farms de Mexico. Neither red cabbage nor carrots (components of the Taylor Farms de Mexico salad mix linked with illness in Iowa and Nebraska) were used in this restaurant. Preliminary traceback information indicates that Puebla, Mexico, was a source of the fresh cilantro that was served to ill persons in this restaurant.</p><p>Investigations were also conducted at two other Mexican-style restaurants in Central Texas. These restaurants were not related to the restaurant in Fort Bend County, not part of the same chain, and not part of a national restaurant chain. A formal analytic epidemiologic study was not conducted among ill persons who had eaten at either location since these clusters had relatively few ill persons (two confirmed and three probable cases who had eaten at one restaurant and two confirmed cases who had eaten at the second). Preliminary traceback information indicates that Puebla, Mexico, was a source of the cilantro that was served to ill persons at both restaurants, and that the lettuce served in the restaurants was not from Taylor Farms de Mexico.</p><h5>Grocery Store Cluster Investigation in Texas</h5><p>An investigation was also conducted among four ill persons who reported shopping at a single location of a grocery store in North Texas. All four ill persons reported having eaten fresh cilantro they purchased at this store before they became ill. Shopper card information was available for three (of four) persons, who gave permission for public health officials to retrieve their purchase data. A review of their shopper card records identified that all three had purchased fresh cilantro within 3 days of each other. In addition, all three had purchased the fresh cilantro during the 7&#8211;10 days before they became ill, which is consistent with the incubation period for cyclosporiasis. A further review of shopper card records did not identify any other foods purchased in common among these ill persons. Preliminary traceback information indicates that Puebla, Mexico, was a source of fresh cilantro available for purchase at this grocery store location during the period when the persons who became ill purchased it.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>The findings in the investigations suggest that there was more than one outbreak of cyclosporiasis during June&#8211;August 2013 in the United States. Restaurant-associated illnesses in Iowa and Nebraska were linked to salad mix from Taylor Farms de Mexico in Guanajuato, Mexico. Some illnesses in Texas were linked to fresh cilantro from Puebla, Mexico.</p></div></div>

Since the last update on August 26, 6 additional ill people were reported.</p><p>Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 92 years, with a median age of 51 years. Fifty-six percent (56%) of ill persons are female. Among 591 ill persons for whom information is available, 45 (8%) have reported being hospitalized.

This could take up to 5 to 6 weeks.</p><h3>August 26, 2013</h3><h4>Investigation Update</h4><p>Because many of the more recent cases have been reported from Texas, CDC is collaborating with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services and local public health departments to investigate cases of cyclosporiasis reported among people in Texas.</p><p>Public health investigators have interviewed ill people in Texas about their exposures during the 2 weeks before they became ill. These interviews have covered what food they ate and where they ate and purchased their food. On the basis of these interviews, investigators have identified a group (cluster) of ill people who reported eating at the same restaurant. A detailed investigation of this cluster is ongoing. This investigation includes listing the different ingredients in the food that was eaten. People who did not get sick but who also ate meals at the same restaurant on the same days as ill people are also being interviewed. The preliminary analysis of results from this ongoing cluster investigation in Texas does not show a connection to salad mix, leafy greens, and salad mix components produced at Taylor Farms de Mexico.</p><p>From August 11-19, 2013, FDA with the cooperation of Taylor Farms de Mexico and Mexican government authorities conducted a thorough environmental assessment at the firm&#8217;s processing facility. The team also assessed five farms identified through traceback information from the outbreak investigation. The team found that conditions and practices at these facilities at the time of the assessment were in accordance with known food safety protocols. On August 25, 2013, <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/RecallsOutbreaksEmergencies/Outbreaks/ucm361637.htm">Taylor Farms de Mexico, with FDA concurrence</a>, resumed production and shipment of salad mix, leafy greens, and salad mix components to the United States. The firm had voluntarily ceased production and shipment of these products on August 9, 2013.</p><p>The findings in Texas differ from those from earlier investigations in Iowa and Nebraska. In those states investigators linked cyclosporiasis cases acquired after eating in one of multiple restaurants to eating a bagged salad mix from Taylor Farms de Mexico. It is not unusual to recognize outbreaks that happen in the same season but are due to different foods. As in 2013 and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/cyclosporiasis/publications.html#mmwr">in years past</a>, most cases and outbreaks of cyclosporiasis in the United States are detected in spring and summer months. Not all cases during the same time of year are necessarily caused by the same exposure.</p><p>For example, during a several-month period in 1997, there were three separate and unrelated outbreaks of cyclosporiasis caused by different fresh produce items from various sources. Strong evidence from epidemiologic investigations led to the recognition that the outbreaks were separate and unrelated. Although the investigation of cases in 2013 is ongoing, available evidence suggests that not all of the cases of cyclosporiasis in the various states are directly related to each other. CDC continues to work with state and local partners and FDA to investigate clusters of illness, food exposures, and sources of food items.</p><h4>Laboratory Update</h4>No laboratory tests are available yet that can distinguish different strains of the parasite <em>Cyclospora cayetanensis</em>. CDC and other institutions are working on developing new molecular tools that could distinguish one strain from another. These tools would help public health investigators more quickly determine whether cases of <em>Cyclospora</em> infection are linked. These tools could also be useful for linking a possible source of infection to illnesses in people. <h4>Case Count Update</h4><p>As of August 23, 2013 (5pm EDT), a total of 610 ill persons with <em>Cyclospora</em> infection have been reported from 22 states.

<div class="mSyndicate">
<h3>July 22, 2013</h3>

<p>On June 28, 2013, CDC was notified of 2 laboratory-confirmed cases of <em><a href="../gen_info/faqs.html">Cyclospora</a></em><a href="../gen_info/faqs.html"> infection</a> in Iowa residents who had become ill in June and did not have a history of international travel during the 14 days before the onset of illness. Since that date, CDC has been collaborating with public health officials in multiple states and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate an outbreak of cyclosporiasis.</p>

<p>As of July 18, 2013 (5pm EDT), CDC has been notified of more than 200 ill persons with <em>Cyclospora</em> infection in residents of multiple states, including Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, and Wisconsin. Illinois has also notified CDC of one ill person each that may have acquired illness out of state. It is not yet clear whether the ill persons from all of the states are part of the same outbreak. Most of the illness onset dates have ranged from mid-June through early July. At least eight people have reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>

<p>No food items have been implicated to date, but public health authorities are pursing all leads. No common events (e.g., social gatherings) have been identified among the ill persons. Previous <em><a href="../publications.html">Cyclospora</a></em><a href="../publications.html"> foodborne outbreak investigations</a> have implicated various types of fresh produce.</p>
