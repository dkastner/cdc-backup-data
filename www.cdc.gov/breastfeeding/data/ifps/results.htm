    	<p>One special supplemental issue to Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, was published in October, 2008 which includes 14 articles based on findings from the <a class="tp-link-policy tp-external-link-fix" href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/122/Supplement_2.toc" target="_self">Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II)</a><a title="External Web Site Icon" class="external tp-link-policy" aria-label="External Web Site Icon" href="../../../Other/disclaimer.html"> </a>.</p>

<p>To study the longer term outcomes of infant feeding practices, another special <a class="tp-link-policy tp-external-link-fix" href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/Supplement_1.toc" target="_self">Pediatrics supplement</a><a title="External Web Site Icon" class="external tp-link-policy" aria-label="External Web Site Icon" href="../../../Other/disclaimer.html"> </a> is published on Sept 1, 2014. The studies included in 2014 Pediatrics supplement examine association between early feeding practices and dietary and health outcomes at age six years by linking the data from IFPS II to its Year Six Follow-Up (Y6FU).</p>

<h3>Organization of Report on the Infant Feeding Practices Study II (IFPS II)</h3>

<p>About 300 web tables were created to describe the preliminary findings from IFPS II. Generally speaking, the tables were constructed by the order of questions in each questionnaire and grouped under a total of 9 different chapters. Chapter 1 presents the topics covered in the prenatal survey conducted during the last trimester of pregnancy, Chapter 2 presents the topics covered in the neonatal survey conducted during the 1st month after birth, and Chapters 3 − 9 present the topics covered in multiple surveys with each chapter focusing on a different theme. Since many topics in the post-neonatal surveys were repeated across surveys, tables in Chapter 3 − 9 generally show results from the same questions over time. In order to keep each table in one place only, the repeated prenatal or neonatal data were pulled out from Chapter 1 and 2 and included in the longitudinal tables in later chapters.</p>

<p>The report follows the order listed below, and readers can locate the table of their particular interest directly by clicking the hyperlink in the outline of web tables content.</p>

<h3>Table Contents</h3>

<p>In general, there is approximately one table per question in the study. For questions that are repeated in multiple questionnaires, a single table includes data from each of these time points. The data generally come directly from the questionnaire, so in case of any difficulties in understanding a particular table, it is recommended to check the original wording of the question because a better understanding of exactly what was asked in the questionnaire will be helpful in interpreting the results.</p>

<h3>Table Title</h3>

<p>The title of each table is self-explanatory and uses to the extent possible the original wording of the survey question. Because it is very redundant for each table title to include a common phrase of 'Infant Feeding Practices Study II', this phrase was removed from the table titles. Similarly, we did not define the time frame for the prenatal tables over and over again as it was already described that the prenatal survey was conducted during the third trimester of pregnancy. For example, even though the time frame was not indicated in Table 3 of Chapter 1 ('Percent of pregnant women covered by any kind of health insurance or any kind of health care plan by selected demographics'), the time frame this table refers to is the last trimester, when the prenatal survey was conducted.</p>

<p>Samples generally reflect all women who completed a given questionnaire. When the table refers only to a subgroup, we indicate in the title “among …” to specify the subgroup. For example, the title of Table 16 of Chapter 1 'Average weeks of maternity leave pregnant women think that they are eligible for under each category by selected demographics, among those who work for pay' indicates that the sample for this table only includes those pregnant women who answered 'yes' on P16 ('Did you work for pay at any time from the 3 months before you became pregnant up to present time?').</p>

<h3>Table Column/row Headings</h3>

<p>Column headings are normally the response categories and contain the percent of answers and the denominators for the percentages. For questions which women could choose all that apply, we tried to translate 'mark all that apply' into mutually exclusive categories, such as '1 only', '2 only', '1 and 2' unless the number of columns became too many to manage in the table.</p>

<p>Row headings contain different categories of socio-demographic characteristics if the table is stratified. For complex tables, the table was not broken down by the socio-demographic characteristics, and row headings could represent the subgroup of the responses. When N is for multiple rows in the same column rather than for multiple columns in the same row, it was placed at the bottom of the other rows instead of the first row (e.g, Table 37 in Chapter 3).</p>

<h3>Table Values</h3>

<p>The metric of table values appear in the table title, such as percent reporting the reason; thus they are not conveyed in the table itself. All the table values are reported to one decimal place to give a visual distinction between the values and the sample size (Note: some feeding tables in chapter 3 list the sample size beneath the median and put them in parenthesis).</p>

<p>A total of 100% is listed as the last column/row if the categories listed are mutually exclusive and thus will add up to 100. If categories are not mutually exclusive, the table has no column or row for the total value of 100%. In this case, a note that percentages do not add up to 100% is indicated in the footnote.</p>

<h3>Table Footnotes</h3>

<p>Table footnotes are used to 1) list variables used to construct the table (to help locate the original question in the questionnaire or the corresponding data in the SAS dataset; 2) indicate that numbers do not add up to 100% when respondents could check multiple answers; 3) define created variables; 4) explain the specific time period covered or the specific data included in the table.</p>

<h3>Sociodemographic Variables Used to Stratify the Web Tables</h3>

<ol>
<li>Mother's age (4 categories) is from the prenatal questionnaire (P9).</li>

<li>Parity (2 categories) is also from the prenatal questionnaire (P41_1).</li>

<li>Maternal education (3 categories) comes from the Panel Demographic Questionnaire if the mother is the female head of household. If she is not the female head of household, her education information comes from a separate demographic survey that was sent to the study participants who were not panel members.</li>

<li>Poverty index (3 categories) is a constructed variable and defined as a ratio of household income to the poverty thresholds by household size produced by the latest available data from the US Census Bureau.</li>

<li>WIC participation (2 categories): Two WIC variables are used to stratify the web tables, one for the prenatal tables and one for the postnatal tables. The prenatal WIC variable is based on participation by the mother (but not other children) as indicated by P6. The postnatal WIC variable is based on participation by either the mother or the infant and is built by aggregating across all the questionnaires if the mother or infant participated in WIC at any time from month 1 to month 12.</li>

<li>Race/ethnicity (3 categories) includes non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic of all races. Non-Hispanics who are neither white nor black are not included in the race break out. If race of the mother is unknown because the mother was sent but did not return the separate demographic survey, the race of female household head from the Panel Demographic data was used as a proxy.</li>

<li>Region (4 categories) is based on the mailing address and is categorized as Northeast, Midwest, South, and West using the Census region definitions.</li>

<li>Infant age as shown on longitudinal tables reflects the age when the survey was sent to the mother, not the age of the infant when she actually filled out the survey (which could be several weeks later).</li>
