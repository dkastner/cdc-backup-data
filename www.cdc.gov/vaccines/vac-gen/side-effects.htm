<p><strong>Any vaccine can cause side effects.</strong> For the most part these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days. Listed below are vaccines licensed in the United States and side effects that have been associated with each of them. This information is copied directly from <a href="../hcp/vis/index.html">CDC's Vaccine Information Statements</a>, which in turn are derived from the <a href="../acip/index.html">Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices</a> (ACIP) <a href="../hcp/acip-recs/index.html">recommendations</a> for each vaccine.</p>

<p>Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for <a href="../../vaccinesafety/Vaccines/multiplevaccines.html">safety</a>, and like any medication, vaccines can cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially deadly disease.</p>

<h4>What are the risks from Adenovirus vaccine?</h4>

<!--THIS SECTION IN A MODULE (adenovirus-side-effects-risks)-->

			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>A vaccine, like any medicine, could cause a serious reaction. But the risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>

<p><strong>Mild Problems</strong></p>

<p>Several mild problems have been reported within 2 weeks of getting the vaccine:</p>

<ul>
<li>headaches, upper respiratory tract infection (about 1 person in 3)</li>

<li>stuffy nose, sore throat, joint pain (about 1 person in 6)</li>

<li>abdominal pain, cough, nausea (about 1 person in 7)</li>

<li>diarrhea (about 1 person in 10)</li>

<li>fever (about 1 person in 100)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Serious Problems</strong></p>

<p>More serious problems have been reported by about 1 person in 100, within 6 months of vaccination. These problems included:</p>

<ul>
<li>blood in the urine or stool</li>

<li>pneumonia</li>

<li>inflammation of the stomach or intestines</li>
</ul>

<p>It is not clear whether these mild or serious problems were caused by the vaccine or occurred after vaccination by chance.</p>

<p>As with all vaccines, adenovirus vaccine will continue to be monitored for unexpected or severe problems.</p>

	</div>
	  

<p class="smallFontSize gray4-color">Note: Adenovirus vaccine is approved for use only among military personnel.</p>

<p>This information is based on the <a href="../hcp/vis/vis-statements/adenovirus.html">Adenovirus VIS</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="anthrax" name="anthrax"> </a>Anthrax vaccine side-effects</h3>

<h4>What are the risks from anthrax vaccine?</h4>

<!--THIS SECTION IN A MODULE (anthrax-side-effects-risks)-->

			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Like any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction.</p>

<p>Anthrax is a very serious disease, and the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is extremely small.</p>

<p><strong>Mild Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Reactions on the arm where the shot was given:

<ul>
<li>Tenderness (about 1 person out of 2)</li>

<li>Redness (about 1 out of 7 men and 1 out of 3 women)</li>

<li>Itching (about 1 out of 50 men and 1 out of 20 women)</li>

<li>Lump (about 1 out of 60 men and 1 out of 16 women)</li>

<li>Bruise (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 22 women)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Muscle aches or temporary limitation of arm movement (about 1 out of 14 men and 1 out of 10 women).</li>

<li>Headaches (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 12 women).</li>

<li>Fatigue (about 1 out of 15 men, about 1 out of 8 women).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Severe Problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Serious allergic reaction (very rare – less than once in 100,000 doses).</li>
</ul>

<p>As with any vaccine, other severe problems have been reported. But these don’t appear to occur any more often among anthrax vaccine recipients than among unvaccinated people.</p>

<p>There is no evidence that anthrax vaccine causes long-term health problems.</p>

<p>Independent civilian committees have not found anthrax vaccination to be a factor in unexplained illnesses among Gulf War veterans.</p>

<h4>What are the risks from DTaP vaccine?</h4>

<!--THIS SECTION IN A MODULE (dtap-side-effects-risks)-->

			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Getting diphtheria, tetanus, or pertussis disease is much riskier than getting DTaP vaccine.</p>

<p>However, a vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of DTaP vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small.</p>

<p><strong>Mild Problems (Common)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fever (up to about 1 child in 4)</li>

<li>Redness or swelling where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4)</li>

<li>Soreness or tenderness where the shot was given (up to about 1 child in 4)</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems occur more often after the 4th and 5th doses of the DTaP series than after earlier doses. Sometimes the 4th or 5th dose of DTaP vaccine is followed by swelling of the entire arm or leg in which the shot was given, lasting 1-7 days (up to about 1 child in 30).</p>

<p><strong>Other mild problems include:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Fussiness (up to about 1 child in 3)</li>

<li>Tiredness or poor appetite (up to about 1 child in 10)</li>

<li>Vomiting (up to about 1 child in 50)</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems generally occur 1-3 days after the shot.</p>

<p><strong>Moderate Problems (Uncommon)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Seizure (jerking or staring) (about 1 child out of 14,000)</li>

<li>Non-stop crying, for 3 hours or more (up to about 1 child out of 1,000)</li>

<li>High fever, over 105°F (about 1 child out of 16,000)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Severe Problems (Very Rare)</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Serious allergic reaction (less than 1 out of a million doses)</li>

<li>Several other severe problems have been reported after DTaP vaccine. These include:

<ul>
<li>Long-term seizures, coma, or lowered consciousness</li>

<li>Permanent brain damage.</li>
</ul>

These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Controlling fever is especially important for children who have had seizures, for any reason. It is also important if another family member has had seizures. You can reduce fever and pain by giving your child an <em>aspirin-free</em> pain reliever when the shot is given, and for the next 24 hours, following the package instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Minor problems </strong>following hepatitis A vaccine include:</p>

<ul>

<li>low-grade fever</li>

<li>headache</li>

<li>tiredness</li>
</ul>

<p>If these problems occur, they usually begin soon after the shot and last 1 or 2 days.</p>

<p>Your doctor can tell you more about these reactions.</p>

<p><strong>Other problems that could happen after this vaccine:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.</li>

<li>Some people get shoulder pain that can be more severe and longer lasting than the more routine soreness that can follow injections. This happens very rarely.</li>

<li>Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</li>

    	<p>This HPV vaccine has been used in the U.S. and around the world for about six years and has been very safe.</p>

<p>However, any medicine could possibly cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction. The risk of any vaccine causing a serious injury, or death, is extremely small.</p>

<h4>What are the risks from PCV13?</h4>

<!--THIS SECTION IN A MODULE (pcv13-side-effects-risks)-->

			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>With any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions. These are usually mild and go away on their own, but serious reactions are also possible.</p>

<p>Problems reported following PCV13 varied by age and dose in the series. The most common problems reported among children were:</p>

<ul>
<li>About half became drowsy after the shot, had a temporary loss of appetite, or had redness or tenderness where the shot was given.</li>

<li>About 1 out of 3 had swelling where the shot was given.</li>

<li>About 1 out of 3 had a mild fever, and about 1 in 20 had a fever over 102.2°F.</li>

<li>Up to about 8 out of 10 became fussy or irritable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adults have reported pain, redness, and swelling where the shot was given; also mild fever, fatigue, headache, chills, or muscle pain.</p>

<p>Young children who get PCV13 along with inactivated flu vaccine at the same time may be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever. Ask your doctor for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Problems that could happen after any vaccine:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>People sometimes faint after a medical procedure, including vaccination. Sitting or lying down for about 15 minutes can help prevent fainting, and injuries caused by a fall. Tell your doctor if you feel dizzy, or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.</li>

<li>Some older children and adults get severe pain in the shoulder and have difficulty moving the arm where a shot was given. This happens very rarely.</li>

<li>Any medication can cause a severe allergic reaction. Such reactions from a vaccine are very rare, estimated at about 1 in a million doses, and would happen within a few minutes to a few hours after the vaccination.</li>
</ul>

<p>As with any medicine, there is a very small chance of a vaccine causing a serious injury or death.</p>

<p>The safety of vaccines is always being monitored. For more information, visit <a href="../../vaccinesafety/index.html">CDC's Vaccine Safety website</a>.</p>

<!--THIS SECTION IN A MODULE (rabies-side-effects-risks)-->

			<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>A vaccine, like any medicine, is capable of causing serious problems, such as severe allergic reactions. The risk of a vaccine causing serious harm, or death, is extremely small. Serious problems from rabies vaccine are very rare.</p>

<p><strong>Mild problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>soreness, redness, swelling, or itching where the shot was given (30% - 74%)</li>

<li>headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, dizziness (5% - 40%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Moderate problems</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>hives, pain in the joints, fever (about 6% of booster doses)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other nervous system disorders, such as Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), have been reported after rabies vaccine, but this happens so rarely that it is not known whether they are related to the vaccine.</p>

<p>NOTE: Several brands of rabies vaccine are available in the United States, and reactions may vary between brands. Your provider can give you more information about a particular brand.</p>

<p>Most babies who get rotavirus vaccine do not have any problems with it. But some problems have been associated with rotavirus vaccine:</p>

<p><span class="bold">Mild problems</span> following rotavirus vaccine:</p>

<ul>
<li>Babies might become irritable, or have mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting after getting a dose of rotavirus vaccine.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="bold">Serious problems</span> following rotavirus vaccine:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Intussusception is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital, and could require surgery. It happens “naturally” in some babies every year in the United States, and usually there is no known reason for it.</p>

<p>There is also a small risk of intussusception from rotavirus vaccination, usually within a week after the 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> vaccine dose. This additional risk is estimated to range from about 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 US infants who get rotavirus vaccine. Your doctor can give you more information.</p>
