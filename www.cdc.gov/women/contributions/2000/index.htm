 <p>Below is a sample of contributions CDC and ATSDR have made in women's health during the 2000s. </p>
 <h2>2009 </h2>
 <p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/women/righttoknow/default.htm">
   <!-- --></a>CDC designed <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/women/righttoknow/default.htm">The Right to Know Campaign</a> to increase awareness of breast cancer among women with physical disabilities and encourage these women to get screened. </p>
 <p>The new 2009 <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/data/report_card.htm">Breastfeeding Report Card</a> provides information for each state on key breastfeeding indicators, showing where each state has been successful and where more work is needed to improve breastfeeding practices. </p>
 <p>This new report, <a href="../../../reproductivehealth.1.html">A Public Health Focus on Infertility Prevention, Detection, and Management</a>, examines the issue of infertility in the United States. The article, published in <em>Fertility and Sterility</em>, presents information on the efforts of a CDC-wide working group that found considerable gaps and opportunities in surveillance, research, communication, and policy development on infertility. </p>
 <p>Published interim <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/h1n1flu/guidance">H1N1 Flu guidance</a> for clinicians and pregnant and breastfeeding women. </p>

 <h2>2008 </h2>
 <p>Published <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5721a3.htm">Guiding Principles for Development of ACIP Recommendations for Vaccination During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding</a>, which provides guidance to help standardize procedures for policy formulation and presentation of the rationale and recommendations for vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women. These principles will be applied to future Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices vaccine statements and routine updates of existing statements in which vaccination of pregnant and breastfeeding women is considered. </p>
 <p>Published a report on the first national <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5723a1.htm?s_cid=mm5723a1_e">Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) Survey</a>. In 2007, CDC conducted this survey to characterize maternity practices related to breastfeeding. The report summarizes results of that survey, which indicated that 1) a substantial proportion of facilities used maternity practices that are not evidence-based and are known to interfere with breastfeeding and 2) states in the southern United States generally have lower mPINC scores, including certain states previously determined to have the lowest 6-month breastfeeding rates. These results highlights the need for U.S. hospitals and birth centers to implement changes in maternity practices that support breastfeeding. </p>
 <p>Launched the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/healthdisparities/what_cdc_is_doing/aamm.htm">African American Women and Mass Media Pilot Campaign</a>, which uses radio and print media to make more women aware of the importance of getting mammograms to find breast cancer early. The campaign also seeks to increase the use of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program screening services among African American women aged 40-64. The campaign is being piloted in Savannah and Macon, Georgia. </p>
 <p>Published, in collaboration with the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/populations/womendiab/womendiab.pdf" target="_blank">Women with Diabetes: Quality of Health Care, 2004-2005</a> . This report uses national data sets to show gaps in knowledge about quality of care among women with diagnosed diabetes. The report examines the quality of health care in the United States for women with and without diagnosed diabetes, using the most scientifically based measures and national data sources available. It presents 15 measures of health care quality showing the use of services in several areas: access to care, general well-being, evidence-based diabetes-specific preventive care, cardiovascular disease-specific preventive care, cancer-specific care, immunizations, and dental care. </p>
 <p>Released <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stdconference/2008/press/release-11march2008.htm">findings of an STD study</a> that estimates that one in four (26 percent) young women between the ages of 14 and 19 in the United States (3.2 million teenage girls) is infected with at least one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases (human papillomavirus, chlamydia, herpes simplex virus type 2, and trichomoniasis). The study is the first to examine the combined national prevalence of common STDs among adolescent women in the United States. </p>

 <h2>2000 </h2>
 <p>Published results from the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/UnintendedPregnancy/Sterilization.htm">Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST)</a> study on tubal sterilization and menstrual abnormalities. For nearly a half century, there has been some concern that tubal sterilization may result in menstrual abnormalities, such as an increase in menstrual pain and bleeding. Results of this study showed that tubal sterilization is not associated with menstrual problems. </p>
 <p>Developed <a href="../../../homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/index.html">Tool Kit to Prevent Senior Falls</a> to provide health professionals with current technical information and science-based materials about senior falls and fall-related injuries that can be incorporated into new or existing prevention activities. </p>
 <p>Funded ten <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/demosipv.htm">prevention projects</a> on sexual violence and intimate partner violence among racial and ethnic minority populations, which supported the development, implementation, and evaluation of sexual violence and intimate partner violence prevention programs and services targeting minority populations. </p>
 <p>Published <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4902a2.htm">Reducing Falls and Resulting Hip Fractures among Older Women</a>. Findings showed that age is a risk factor for hip fracture, and women are more likely to be hospitalized for hip fractures. Fall prevention programs using multifaceted approaches that are community based have been shown to be effective. </p>
 <p>Published <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/rr/rr4902.pdf">Recommendations Regarding Selected Conditions Affecting Women's Health</a> that focused on four women's health issues: falls and resulting hip fractures; exercise-related injuries; breast and cervical cancer detection; and congenital toxoplasmosis. For each report, prevention recommendations and specific research recommendations were provided. </p>
 <p>Published <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/breast/pdf/BCLaws.PDF">State Laws Relating to Breast Cancer, January 1949 to May 2000</a> . This summary covered all legislation enacted between January 1949 and May 2000. </p>
 <p>To increase access to treatment for women diagnosed through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/legislation/law106-354.htm">Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act</a> that authorizes states, if they choose, to provide Medicaid coverage for treatment services for women screened by the program and identified with a cancerous condition. </p>
 <p>Published <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4911a1.htm">Building Data Systems for Monitoring and Responding to Violence Against Women: Recommendations from a Workshop</a>, which provided recommendations regarding public health surveillance and research on violence against women. The report resulted from a workshop co-sponsored by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Justice. </p>
 <p>Supported and participated in the First International Conference on Women, Heart Disease and Stroke in Victoria, Canada. The conference led to the development of the 2000 Victoria Declaration on Women, Heart Diseases and Stroke: Science and Policy in Action. </p>
 <p>Published <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/library/maps/cvdatlas/index.htm">Women and Heart Disease: An Atlas of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mortality</a> in conjunction with the Office for Social Environment and Health research at West Virginia University. The publication provided critical data on geographic, racial, and ethnic inequalities in women's heart disease death rates for the major racial and ethnic groups. </p>
