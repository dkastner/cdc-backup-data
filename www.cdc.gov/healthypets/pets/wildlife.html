<p><strong>CDC would like to thank MAJ Justin Schlanser, DVM, MPH, Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Preventive Medicine, for his careful review of these pages.</strong></p>

<p>Wildlife includes any undomesticated animal living in the wild, including 
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='coastal brown grizzly bears in alaska' src='../images/brown-grizzly-bears.jpg'/>those hunted for food, sport, or profit. Many people enjoy watching wildlife, and studies have shown that positive encounters with wildlife can have profound, life-changing effects on people. If you and your pets spend time outdoors around wildlife, you need to be aware of the diseases that can spread from wildlife to you and your pets.</p>

<p>Because wild animals can carry diseases without appearing to be sick, it is important to enjoy wildlife from a distance. Close contact with wildlife or their urine or droppings can spread these diseases to people and pets.</p>

<p>To protect yourself and your family from getting sick:</p>

<ul>
<li>Avoid hand-feeding wildlife.
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='i can see it girl' src='../images/i-can-see-it.jpg'/></li>

<li>Avoid playing or working in areas where there are wildlife droppings.</li>

<li>Leave orphaned animals alone. Often the parents are close by and will return for their young.</li>

<li>Always 
		<a href="../../handwashing/index.html">wash your hands</a>
	 and the hands of children with running water and soap after working or playing outside, especially in areas where wildlife have been spotted.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following some simple health tips, you are less likely to get sick from wildlife in the United States.</p>

		<h3><a href='http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070523.htm'>Aeromoniasis (<em>Aeromonas</em> spp.)</a></h3>
		<div>
		
<p><em>Aeromonas</em> is a type of bacteria that is commonly found in fresh and brackish water. This germ can cause disease in stressed fish and amphibians.&#160;<em>Aeromonas</em> spp. can cause discoloration of&#160;the limbs of amphibians and the fins of fish and can cause internal bleeding in these aquatic animals.</p>

<p>Though it very rarely happens, people can become infected when they handle infected fish or accidentally swallow contaminated food or water. If these germs are swallowed, <em>Aeromonas</em> infections can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Skin infections can happen if the bacteria get into open wounds or scrapes. More severe disease can happen in children or people with weakened immune systems.</p>

<p>Practicing healthy habits, including hand washing, will reduce the risk of <em>Aeromonas</em> infection.</p>

		<h3><a href='../../anthrax/basics/index.html'>Anthrax (<em>Bacillus anthracis</em> spp.)</a></h3>
		<div>
		<p>Anthrax is a naturally occurring disease of animals caused by a type of bacteria called <strong><em>Bacillus anthracis</em></strong>. People and animals can get anthrax when they accidentally breathe in or swallow spores in contaminated soil, food, or water. The greatest risk is from contact with bodily fluids of an animal that has anthrax or has recently died from anthrax. Anthrax can also get into open wounds. People who live in areas where anthrax has occurred should consider vaccinating their livestock against the disease.&#160;</p>

<p>Anthrax is a serious but rare disease in the United States. The symptoms of anthrax depend on the route of infection and can take anywhere from 1 day to more than 2 months to appear. All types of anthrax have the potential, if untreated, to spread throughout the body and cause severe illness and even death. To prevent anthrax, be aware of areas where anthrax is present and wear gloves when handling animal carcasses from those regions. Use care when processing bloated or swollen carcasses so that accumulated gasses blow away from you when the carcass is opened.</p>

		<div>
		<p><em>Baylisascaris</em> infection is caused by roundworm eggs found in raccoon, bear, and skunk droppings. The disease is passed to people and animals if they accidentally ingest contaminated food or soil.</p>

<p>If a person or dog ingests the eggs, the worm larvae then hatch inside them and can migrate through the body. Human infections are rare but can be severe if the parasites invade the eye (ocular larva migrans), organs (visceral larva migrans), or brain (neural larva migrans).</p>

<p>Raccoon roundworm can be prevented by avoiding areas frequented by raccoons. If you need to clean raccoon droppings up, wear gloves and use caution so as not to kick up dust. Always wash your hands after working or playing in dirt.</p>

		<div>
		<p><em>C. botulinum</em> produces a toxin that causes botulism, a rare but serious condition in humans. <em>Clostridium botulinum </em>is a type of bacteria that can be found in the intestines of many marine and freshwater species of fish worldwide. Though rare, outbreaks of botulism can be associated with fish, including aquatic game, canned foods, and smoked fish. Affected fish show few signs of illness, though some fish may have pale gill colorings or abdominal swelling.</p>

<p>A person with botulism can develop double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, and paralysis, which can result in death. People are commonly exposed through the environment or contaminated food, such as smoked fish products. To protect yourself from botulism, avoid fishing in areas where there are dead fish or waterfowl and cook all fish thoroughly. Anyone who thinks they may have botulism should seek emergency medical care.</p>

<p>Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that affects the ability of animals to reproduce. The disease can be spread to humans through contact with the birthing tissues from infected animals or through drinking unpasteurized (raw) milk. Among wildlife; bison; elk; caribou; moose; feral pigs; and some marine mammals can be infected with <em>Brucella</em>. Infected animals may have decreased appetite, weight loss, behavioral changes, and lack of energy, but most animals infected with brucellosis show no signs of illness. Brucellosis affects the reproductive organs and can cause miscarriage in animals and occasionally people.</p>

<p>People who hunt or eat fresh game meat are at highest risk for contracting brucellosis. They may be exposed through skin wounds while dressing a carcass or by eating undercooked meat. People who are infected with brucellosis will usually become sick within 6-8 weeks of exposure. Sick people will have flu-like symptoms that last 2-4 weeks. Sometimes brucellosis can become a chronic illness that can be difficult to treat.</p>

<p>Prevent brucellosis by wearing gloves while handling fresh carcasses and thoroughly cooking any meat that will be eaten.</p>

		<div>
		<p>Echinococcosis is a parasitic disease caused by eating or drinking food or water contaminated with tapeworm eggs or through contact with an infected animal. This parasite is a tapeworm that can form large fluid-filled cysts in the tissues of animals or people who accidentally eat the eggs. The adult tapeworm can be found in foxes, coyotes, cats, and other wild predators. Animals become infected by eating the tissue of an infected animal. Infected animals rarely show any signs of disease but can have a large number of adult tapeworms.</p>

<p>Although the <em>Echinococcus</em> parasite invades many different organs of the body, most people who are infected with the disease will not have any signs of illness for years. Symptoms start when the slow-growing cysts become large enough to press on the organs they have invaded. The tapeworms grow slowly in several different organs of the body but are most commonly found in the liver and lungs.</p>

		<h3><a href='../../Tularemia/index.html'>Tularemia  (<em>Francisella tularensis</em>)</a></h3>
		<div>
		
<p>Tularemia is a bacterial disease that can spread to people through bites from ticks or deer flies, handling or consuming infected animals, accidentally swallowing contaminated water, or inhaling contaminated dust. Though typically a wildlife disease, tularemia has been reported in all U.S. states except Hawaii. Affected animals may have sudden onset of fever, weakness, decreased appetite, and reduced mobility. Within a few hours or days, the animal can become stiff and die.</p>

<p>People exposed to tularemia can have a variety of symptoms ranging from fever, chills, headache, and muscle aches to skin ulcers; swollen and painful lymph nodes; inflamed eyes; sore throat; mouth sores and diarrhea. They may also develop pneumonia.</p>

<p>People exposed to an infected animal should be seen by their doctor immediately because treatment works best when started early.</p>

<p>You can reduce your risk of tularemia by handling dead animals with gloves, cooking game meat thoroughly, wearing insect repellent, and when possible, avoiding mowing over dead animals during outside work.</p>

		<h3><a href='http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/vesicular_stomatitis.pdf'>Vesicular stomatitis  </a></h3>
		<div>
		<p>Vesicular stomatitis is a disease caused by a virus. Vesicular stomatitis is primarily a disease of livestock, but people and several species of wildlife can become infected. Infected animals may have fluid-filled blisters, called vesicles, around the mouth, on their feet, or under the belly.</p>

<p>It is very rare for people to get vesicular stomatitis. Infections can occur when people handle sick animals or contaminated tissues and blood from sick animals. Infected people may have a variety of symptoms ranging from no signs of illness to flu-like symptoms and blisters.</p>

<p>Reduce the risk for Vesicular stomatitis by washing your hands after handling affected wildlife.</p>

		<h3>Vibriosis  (<em>Vibrio</em> spp.)</h3>
		<div>
		<p><em>Vibrio </em>are bacteria that are mostly found in saltwater and cause serious disease in marine fish. People usually get sick with vibriosis after eating raw or undercooked fish or shellfish or after swallowing contaminated water. Fish affected by <em>Vibrio</em> can have symptoms ranging from deep skin ulcers to more wide-spread signs of skin darkening, scale loss, swelling of the abdomen, and loss of appetite.</p>

<p>In people, <em>Vibrio</em> can cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Some types of <em>Vibrio</em> can also cause skin infections from contact with contaminated water.</p>

<p>People can prevent vibriosis infections by eating cooked fish and shellfish and by avoiding exposure of open wounds or broken skin to warm salt or brackish water, and avoiding raw shellfish harvested from such waters.</p>				</div>

		<h3><a href='../../westnile/index.html'>West Nile Virus  (WNV)</a></h3>
		<div>
		<p>West Nile Virus is carried by birds and transmitted by mosquitoes. People, birds, and horses get WNV by being bitten by an infected mosquito. Most animals infected with WNV will show no signs of illness. Some birds will die of the disease.</p>

<p>Most people who become infected with WNV do not have any signs of illness; however, people who do become ill usually have flu-like symptoms.&#160; A small percentage of people with WNV infection develop a more serious neurologic illness, such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the brain and surrounding tissues). &#160;</p>

<p>Prevent West Nile Virus by using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants, and limiting outdoor exposure from dusk to dawn. Using air conditioning, installing window and door screens, and reducing mosquito breeding sites, can further decrease the risk for WNV exposure.</p>

<p>Wildlife should always be enjoyed from a distance. If you are close enough that 
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='will wood mouse' src='../images/wild-wood-mouse.jpg'/>the animal changes its behavior (for example, stops eating or runs away), you are too close! Wild animals can carry diseases but not appear to be sick at all, so staying away is the safest way to enjoy viewing wildlife. Follow these simple tips to help protect your family and pets from getting diseases from wildlife. Additional tips and information about outdoor safety and disease control can be found under “More Information.”</p>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="#protect" name="#protect" title="Protect your home"><!-- --></a>Protect your home</h3>

<ul>
<li>Keep windows and doors closed or screened and cover any holes or openings to prevent bats, rodents, or other wild animals from entering your home, church, school, or other buildings.
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='father and son repairing garden house' src='../images/repairing-garden.jpg'/></li>

<li>Clean up trash around your home and keep your garbage cans closed. Garbage and trash can attract unwanted visits from wildlife.</li>

<li>Do not leave food (bait) outside to attract animals to your backyard. This brings the animals closer together and close to you, and this makes it easier for disease to spread.</li>

<li>Keep compost and wood piles at least 100 feet away from buildings to help reduce rodent infestations in the building.</li>

<li>Make sure pets do not have access to stagnant water sources (ponds, bird baths, etc.) that are also used by wildlife.</li>

<li>Find rodent- and bat-proofing information under the More Information tab.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="#handle" name="#handle" title="Don&rsquo;t handle wildlife"><!-- --></a>Don’t handle wildlife</h3>

<ul>
<li>Teach children to never handle unfamiliar animals, wild or domestic, 
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='young rabbits on the grass' src='../images/young-rabbits.jpg'/>even if they appear friendly or harmless.</li>

<li>Do not touch or pick up dead animals with your bare hands. Consider calling animal control to remove any dead animals.</li>

<li>Never adopt wild animals or bring them into your home. Do not try to save or rescue wild animals. If you have already found an animal, refer to the National Wildlife Rehabilitator’s Association’s <a href="http://www.nwrawildlife.org/content/help-ive-found-animal">Help! I’ve found an animal page</a>.&#160;</li>

<li>If an animal appears sick or hurt, call animal control to help. Do not touch young animals that appear to be abandoned. Often their parents are close by waiting for you to leave before they return to their young.</li>

<li>Protect wildlife in your national parks and local recreational areas by staying on trails and following visitor guidelines, including those for trash disposal.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="#disease" name="#disease" title="Protect yourself from disease"><!-- --></a>Protect yourself from disease</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make washing your hands a routine practice before eating or drinking 
	<img class="polaroid-right" alt='man applying insect repellent' src='../images/repellent.jpg'/>and whenever you return from outside.</li>

<li>Take care of bites and scratches:

<ul>
<li>Wash wounds well with soap and running water.</li>

<li>Contact your health care provider right away.</li>

<li>If you seek medical attention, make sure to tell them if you have had exposure to wildlife.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Keep bugs away:

<ul>
<li>Use a mosquito and tick repellent when spending time outdoors.</li>

<li>Use a monthly flea and tick preventive on your pets.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Ask your veterinarian how to protect your pets from wildlife diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis, and giardia.</li>

<li>Call animal control right away if an animal, wild or domestic, is acting strangely or out of character.</li>
</ul>
