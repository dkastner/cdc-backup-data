<p><strong>SYSTEM NAME: &nbsp; </strong>National Select Agent Registry (NSAR)/Select Agent Transfer  and Entity Registration Information System (SATERIS), HHS/CDC/COTPER.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Security Classification:&nbsp; </strong>Unclassified.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>System Location: </strong>Division of Select Agents and Toxins  (DSAT), Coordinating Office for Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response  (COTPER), Bldg. 20, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1600  Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, GA 30333 and Federal Records Center, 4712 Southpark  Blvd., Ellenwood, GA 30294.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Categories of Individuals Covered By  the System: </strong>The  Responsible Official, alternate Responsible Official, owners of  non-governmental entities, and individuals requesting access to select agents  under the provisions of Part 73, of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (42 CFR part 73), Part 121 of Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (9 CFR  Part 121), and Part 331 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations (7 CFR  part 331).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Categories of Records in the System: </strong>The DSAT maintains records which  include the names of the Responsible Official, alternate Responsible Official,  owners of non-governmental entities, and individuals who have access, or who  have applied to have access to select agents (defined as a virus, bacteria,  fungus or toxin that could pose a severe threat to public health and safety, to  animal or plant health; or animal or plant products), and the list of select  agents to which they have access. The Responsible Official, alternate  Responsible Official, owners of non-governmental entities, and individuals  requesting access to select agents are required to provide their name, address,  date of birth, and job title and the name of the institution that would be  housing the select agent(s).<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Authority For Maintenance of the  System:</strong> Public  Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response <br />
  Act of 2002  and The Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-188).</p>
<p><strong>Purpose(s): </strong>Records maintained in the National  Select Agent Registry (NSAR)--a joint DSAT and U.S. Department of  Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) information  management system--are accessed by DSAT through the Select Agent Transfer and  Entity Registration Information System (SATERIS) which is an user interface for  data entry, data query, and routine reporting activities. The purpose of this  system of records is to limit access to those select agents listed in 42 CFR  Part 73, 9 CFR Part 121, and 7 CFR Part 331 to those individuals who have a  legitimate need to handle or use such select agents, and who are not identified  as a restricted person by the U.S. Attorney General. The NSAR is also used to  track the possession, use, and transfer of select agents and is a single  Web-based system shared by DSAT and APHIS.<strong></strong></p>
<p>DSAT  conducts regulatory oversight of individuals and entities that possess, use, or  transfer select agents. This includes the review of registration applications,  conducting inspections of registered facilities or facilities requesting registration,  processing requests to import select agents, processing all reports and  requests received from individuals or entities regarding a select agent, and maintaining  this information pertaining to individuals and entities that possess, use,  and/or transfer select agents.</p>
<p><strong>Routine Uses of Records Maintained In  the System, Including Categories of Users and the Purposes of Such Uses:</strong><br />
  1. Records  may be disclosed to contractors to handle program work overflow duties,  performing many of the same functions (listed in the Purpose section above) as  DSAT employees. Contractors are required to maintain Privacy Act safeguards  with respect to such records.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  2. Records  may be disclosed to health departments and other public health or cooperating  medical authorities to deal more effectively with outbreaks and conditions of  public health significance.</p>
<p>3. Personal  information from this system may be disclosed as a routine use to assist the  recipient Federal agency in making a determination concerning an individual's  trustworthiness to access select agents; to any Federal or State agency where  the purpose in making the disclosure is to prevent access to select agents for  use in domestic or international terrorism or for any criminal purpose; or to  any Federal or State agency to protect the public health and safety with regard  to the possession, use, or transfer of select agents.</p>
<p>4.  Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record of an  individual in response to a verified inquiry from the congressional office made  at the written request of that individual.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  5. In the  event of litigation where the defendant is: (a) The Department, any component  of the Department, or any employee of the Department in his or her official  capacity; (b) the United States where the Department determines that the claim,  if successful, is likely to directly affect the operations of the Department or  any of its components; or (c) any Department employee in his or her individual  capacity where the Justice Department has agreed to represent such employee,  disclosure may be made to the Department of Justice to enable that Department  to present an effective defense, provided that such disclosure is compatible  with the purpose for which the records were collected.</p>
<p><strong>Policies and Practices For Storing,  Retrieving, Accessing, Retaining, and Disposing of Records In the System Storage: </strong>File folders,  computer tapes and disks, CD-ROMs.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Retrievability: </strong>By name or DOJ identifier number.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Safeguards: </strong>The following special safeguards are  provided to protect the records from inadvertent disclosure:<strong></strong></p>
<p>1. <strong>Authorized Users:</strong> A database security  package is implemented on CDC computers to control unauthorized access to the  system. Attempts to gain access by unauthorized individuals are automatically  recorded and reviewed on a regular basis. Individuals who have routine access  to these records are limited to Select Agent Program staff (DSAT FTEs and  contractors) who have responsibility for conducting regulatory oversight of  individuals and entities that possess, use, or transfer select agents.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Physical Safeguards:</strong> Paper records are  maintained in locked cabinets in locked rooms in a restricted access location  that is controlled by a cardkey system, and security guard service provides  personnel screening of visitors. Electronic data files are password protected  and stored in a restricted access location. The computer room is protected by  an automatic sprinkler system, numerous automatic sensors (e.g., water, heat,  smoke, etc.) are installed, and a proper mix of portable fire extinguishers is  located throughout the computer room. The system is backed up on a nightly  basis with copies of the files stored off site in a secure location. Computer  workstations, lockable personal computers, and automated records are located in  secured areas.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Procedural Safeguards:</strong> Protection for  computerized records includes programmed verification of valid user  identification code and password prior to logging on to the system; mandatory  password changes, limited log-ins, virus protection, and user rights/file  attribute restrictions. Password protection imposes user name and password  log-in requirements to prevent unauthorized access. Each user name is assigned  limited access rights to files and directories at varying levels to control  file sharing. There are routine daily backup procedures and secure off-site  storage is available for backup files.</p>
<p>Knowledge of  individual tape passwords is required to access tapes, and access to the system  is limited to users obtaining prior supervisory approval. To avoid inadvertent  data disclosure, a special additional procedure isperformed to ensure that all  Privacy Act data are removed from computer tapes and/or other magnetic media.  When possible, a backup copy of data is stored at an offsite location and a log  kept of all changes to each file and all persons reviewing the file. Additional  safeguards may also be built into the program by the system analyst as  warranted by the sensitivity of the data set.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  The DSAT and  contractor employees who maintain records are instructed in specific procedures  to protect the security of records, and are to check with the system manager  prior to making disclosure of data. When individually identified data are being  used in a room, admittance at either CDC or contractor sites is restricted to  specifically authorized personnel.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  Appropriate  Privacy Act provisions are included in contracts and the CDC Project Director,  contract officers, and project officers oversee compliance with these  requirements. Upon completion of the contract, all data will be either returned  to CDC or destroyed, as specified by the contract.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  The  USDA/APHIS maintains similarly stringent safeguards that are discussed within  that agency's Select Agent system of records notice.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Implementation Guidelines:</strong> The  safeguards outlined above are in accordance with the HHS Information Security  Program Policy and FIPS Pub 200, ``Minimum Security Requirements for Federal  Information and Information Systems.'' Data maintained on CDC's Mainframe and  the COTPER LAN are in compliance with OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III. </p>
<p>Security is  provided for information collection, processing, transmission, storage, and  dissemination in general support systems and major applications.</p>
<p><strong>Retention and Disposal: </strong>The DSAT records and associated  information are retained and dispositioned in accordance with DSAT records  retention schedule, N1-442-06-1, pending approval by the National Archives and  Records Administration. The DSAT records will be retained for 10 years in  compliance with the records retention schedule requirements or until such time  as no longer needed for litigation or other records purposes. Records will be  transferred to a Federal   Records Center  for storage when no longer in active use. Final disposition of records stored  offsite at the Federal   Records Center  will be accomplished by a controlled process requesting final dispositionapproval  from the record owner prior to any destruction to ensure records are not needed  for litigation orother records purposes. Hard copy records and Sensitive But  Unclassified (SBU) information designated for local disposition will be placed  in a locked container or designated secure storage area while awaiting  destruction. All SBU data will be destroyed in a manner that precludes its  reconstruction, such as shredding.</p>
<p>Electronic  information will be deleted or overwritten using overwriting software that  wipes the entire physical disk and not just the virtual disk. Overwriting is  required for the destruction of all electronic SBU information.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>System manager(s) and Address: </strong>Director, Division of Select Agents  and Toxins, Coordinating Office <strong></strong><br />
  for  Terrorism Preparedness and Emergency Response, Bldg. 20, Rm. 4100, MS A46,  Centers for Disease Controland Prevention, 1600 Clifton Road, NE., Atlanta, GA   30333.</p>
<p><strong>Notification Procedure: </strong>An individual may learn if a record  exists about himself or herself by contacting the system manager at the above  address. Requesters in person must provide driver's license or other positive  identification. Individuals who do not appear in person must submit a notarized  request on institutional letterhead to verify theiridentity. The knowing and  willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual  under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Privacy Act subject to a  $5,000 fine and/or imprisonment.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Record Access Procedures: </strong>Same as notification procedures.  Requestors should also reasonably <strong>&nbsp;</strong>specify the record contents being sought.  An accounting of disclosures that have been made of the record, if any, may  also be requested.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Contesting Record Procedures: </strong>Contact the system manager at the  address specified above, reasonably identify the record and specify the  information being contested, the corrective action sought, and the reasons for  requesting the correction, along with supporting information to show how the  record is inaccurate, incomplete, untimely, or irrelevant.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Record Source Categories: </strong>Applicants registering for  possession, use, and transfer of select <strong></strong><br />
  agents and  the U.S. Attorney General.</p>
