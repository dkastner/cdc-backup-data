                                In the event of litigation initiated at the request of NIOSH, the Institute may disclose such records
                                as it deems desirable or necessary to the Department of Justice and to the Department of Labor, Office
                                of the Solicitor, where appropriate, to enable the Departments to effectively represent the Institute,
                                provided such disclosure is compatible with the purpose for which the records were collected. The only
                                types of litigation proceedings that NIOSH is authorized to request are: (1) Enforcement of a subpoena
                                issued to an employer to provide relevant information; and (2) administrative search warrants to obtain
                                access to places of employment and relevant information therein and related contempt citations against
                                an employer for failure to comply with a warrant obtained by the Institute; and (3) injunctive relief

                                This may be done for obtaining a determination regarding an individual's health status and last known
                                address. If the sources determine that the individual is dead, NIOSH may obtain death certificates,
                                which state the cause of death, from the appropriate Federal, State or local agency. If the individual
                                is alive, NIOSH may obtain information on health status from disease registries or on last known address
                                in order to contact the individual for a health study or to inform him or her of health findings. This
                                information on health status enables NIOSH to evaluate whether excess occupationally related mortality
                                or morbidity is occurring.</p>

                            <a name="notproc" id="notproc"></a><strong>Notification procedure</strong>: An individual may learn if a record exists about himself or herself by contacting the system manager at the above address. Requesters in person must provide driver's license or other positive identification. Individuals who do not appear in person must either: (1) submit a notarized request to verify their identity; or (2) certify that they are the individuals they claim to be and that they understand that the knowing and willful request for or acquisition of a record pertaining to an individual under false pretenses is a criminal offense under the Privacy Act subject to a $5,000 fine. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An individual who requests notification of or access to medical records shall, at the time the request is made, designate in writing a responsible representative who is willing to review the record and inform the subject individual of its contents at the representative's discretion. A subject individual will be granted direct access to a medical record if the system manager determines direct access is not likely to have adverse effect on the subject individual. 
The following information must be provided when requesting notification: (1) full name; (2) the approximate date and place of the study, if known; and (3) nature of the questionnaire or study in which the requester participated. 

                        </p>

EEOICPA records are obtained from the individual subject and the employer’s records.
