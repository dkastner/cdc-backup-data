It provides trends for the recent past and highlights data collected through the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System for 2015. Since 1953, through the cooperation of state and local health departments, CDC has collected information on newly reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the United States. The data presented here were collected by the revised TB case report introduced in 2009. Each individual TB case report (Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis, or RVCT) is submitted electronically to CDC. The data for this slide set are based on updates received by CDC as of June 9, 2016.

The resurgence of TB in the mid-1980s was marked by years of increasing case counts until its peak in 1992. Case counts decreased from 1993 and 2014. However, in 2015, a slight increase occurred in the total number of TB cases reported in the United States. From 1992 until 2008, the total number of TB cases decreased 2%&#8211;7% annually. An unprecedented decrease occurred in 2009, when the total number of TB cases decreased by more than 10% from 2008 to 2009. In 2015, a total of 9,557 cases were reported from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC).

Overall completion of therapy had remained at approximately 92%&#8211;93% from 1998 through 2008, but increased to 95%&#8211;96% from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, the latest year with available data, completion of therapy was 95.9%. Completion in &#8804;1 year increased from 63.4% in 1993 to 89.6% in 2013. The Healthy People 2020 objective is completion of therapy in &#8804;1 year for 93% of patients (Objective IID-30, available at: https:// www. healthypeople.gov/ 2020/topics-objectives/objective/iid-30). CDC is working with state and local health departments to determine and evaluate reasons for apparent delayed therapy completion, which might vary by jurisdiction.' src='https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/surv/surv2015/images/slide-31.jpg'/>

This slide set was prepared by the Division of Tuberculosis Elimination, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention (NCHHSTP), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It provides trends for the recent past and highlights data collected through the National Tuberculosis Surveillance System for 2015. Since 1953, through the cooperation of state and local health departments, CDC has collected information on newly reported cases of tuberculosis (TB) disease in the United States. The data presented here were collected by the revised TB case report introduced in 2009. Each individual TB case report (Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis, or RVCT) is submitted electronically to CDC. The data for this slide set are based on updates received by CDC as of June 9, 2016. All case counts and rates for years 1993&#8211;2015 have been updated.' src='https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/surv/surv2015/images/slide-1.jpg'/>

The resurgence of TB in the mid-1980s was marked by years of increasing case counts until its peak in 1992. Case counts decreased from 1993 and 2014. However, in 2015, a slight increase occurred in the total number of TB cases reported in the United States. From 1992 until 2008, the total number of TB cases decreased 2%&#8211;7% annually. An unprecedented decrease occurred in 2009, when the total number of TB cases decreased by more than 10% from 2008 to 2009. In 2015, a total of 9,557 cases were reported from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). This represents an increase of 1.6% from 2014, but a 64.2% decrease from 1992.' src='https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/surv/surv2015/images/slide-2.jpg'/>

Data were available for &gt;86.9% of culture-positive cases for each year. Primary resistance was calculated by using data from persons with no reported prior TB episode. Resistance to at least isoniazid was 8.2% in 1993; however, by 2015, this had increased to 9.0%. Resistance to at least isoniazid and rifampin, known as multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), was 2.5% in 1993.

The percentage of persons with primary MDR-TB has declined among both groups since 1993, although the decline among U.S.-born persons has been greater. Consequently, the proportion of primary MDR-TB cases in the United States that are attributed to foreign-born persons increased from approximately 25% in 1993 to 86% in 2015 (not shown on slide). Among U.S.-born persons, the percentage with primary MDR-TB has been &lt;1% since 1997 and was 0.5% in 2015. The percentage among foreign-born persons has fluctuated year to year, although it has remained from 1.2 to 1.8% since 1995.

One case of XDR-TB was reported in 2015, and the most reported in a single year was 10 in 1993.

Reporting areas began providing information regarding TB treatment therapy completion in 1993 through the individual TB case report form. The calculations include persons alive at diagnosis with an initial regimen of &#8805;1 drug prescribed, who did not die within 1 year of initiating therapy. The calculations exclude persons with an initial rifampin-resistant isolate; patients with bone and joint disease, meningeal disease, or disease of the central nervous system; pediatric patients aged 0&#8211;14 years with miliary disease or a positive blood culture or a positive NAA from a blood specimen; and those who moved out of the country within 1 year of initiating treatment. Overall completion of therapy had remained at approximately 92%&#8211;93% from 1998 through 2008, but increased to 95%&#8211;96% from 2009 to 2013. In 2013, the latest year with available data, completion of therapy was 95.9%. Completion in &#8804;1 year increased from 63.4% in 1993 to 89.6% in 2013. The Healthy People 2020 objective is completion of therapy in &#8804;1 year for 93% of patients (Objective IID-30, available at: https:// www. healthypeople.gov/ 2020/topics-objectives/objective/iid-30).
