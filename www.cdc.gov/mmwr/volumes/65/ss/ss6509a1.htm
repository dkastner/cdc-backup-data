<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p><strong>Problem: </strong>Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to identify sexual minority youth. Significant health disparities exist between sexual minority and nonsexual minority youth. However, not enough is known about health-related behaviors that contribute to negative health outcomes among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these health-related behaviors compare with the prevalence of health-related behaviors among nonsexual minorities.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting Period: </strong>September 2014–December 2015.</p>

<p><strong>Description of the System: </strong>The Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority health-related behaviors among youth and young adults: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. In addition, YRBSS monitors the prevalence of obesity and asthma and other priority health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes a national school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) conducted by CDC and state and large urban school district school-based YRBSs conducted by state and local education and health agencies. For the 2015 YRBSS cycle, a question to ascertain sexual identity and a question to ascertain sex of sexual contacts was added for the first time to the national YRBS questionnaire and to the standard YRBS questionnaire used by the states and large urban school districts as a starting point for their YRBS questionnaires. This report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts from the 2015 national survey, 25 state surveys, and 19 large urban school district surveys conducted among students in grades 9–12.</p>

<p><strong>Results: </strong>Across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 10 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of 18 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 17 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. This pattern also was evident across the six sexual risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these behaviors was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of four was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. No clear pattern of differences emerged for birth control use, dietary behaviors, and physical activity.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation: </strong>The majority of sexual minority students cope with the transition from childhood through adolescence to adulthood successfully and become healthy and productive adults. However, this report documents that sexual minority students have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with nonsexual minority students.</p>

<p><strong>Public Health Action: </strong>To reduce the disparities in health-risk behaviors among sexual minority students, it is important to raise awareness of the problem; facilitate access to education, health care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address priority health-risk behaviors among sexual minority youth; and continue to implement YRBSS at the national, state, and large urban school district levels to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and programmatic interventions on the health-related behaviors of sexual minority youth.</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Introduction" id="introduction"> </a>Introduction</h2>

<p>Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can both be used to identify sexual minority youth. Sexual minority youth include those who identify as gay, lesbian, and bisexual and those who are not sure about their sexual identity as well as those who have sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes. Dissonance between sexual identity and sex of sexual contact occurs, particularly among youth (<em>1</em>–<em>7</em>). Some youth who identify as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual and some youth who are not sure of their sexual identity might not have had any sexual contact. Some youth who have had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes might identify as heterosexual and some youth who have had sexual contact with only the opposite sex might identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual or be not sure of their sexual identity. Sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts can change throughout the life span.</p>

<p>Significant health disparities exist between sexual minority and nonsexual minority youth (<em>7</em>,<em>8</em>). More specifically, violence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, sexually transmitted infections, and pregnancy occur more frequently among sexual minority youth than nonsexual minority youth. In addition, some sexual minority youth struggle with stigma, discrimination, family disapproval, and social rejection. However, not enough is known about health-related behaviors that contribute to negative health outcomes among sexual minority youth and how the prevalence of these health-related behaviors compare with the prevalence of health-related behaviors among nonsexual minority youth (<em>8</em>).</p>

<p>CDC developed the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) to monitor six categories of priority health-related behaviors that contribute to the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among youth and adults in the United States: 1) behaviors that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; 2) tobacco use; 3) alcohol and other drug use; 4) sexual behaviors related to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV infection; 5) unhealthy dietary behaviors; and 6) physical inactivity. These behaviors frequently are interrelated and are established during childhood and adolescence and extend into adulthood. YRBSS also monitors obesity, overweight, asthma, and other priority health-related behaviors. YRBSS includes school-based national, state, and large urban school district Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS) conducted among representative samples of students in grades 9–12. Additional information about the YRBSS is available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs">http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs</a>.</p>

<p>Since 1995, the need for data on the priority health-related behaviors of high school students by sexual minority subgroup has been recognized by an increasing number of states and large urban school districts (<a id="T1_up"> </a><a href="ss6509a1.htm#T1_down">Table 1</a>). With CDC support, these states and large urban school districts began adding at least one of two questions to their YRBS questionnaire to ascertain sexual identity and/or sex of sexual contacts and to generate estimates of priority health-related behaviors by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. For the 1997 YRBSS cycle, a question on sexual identity and a question on sex of sexual contacts were placed on the YRBS Optional Question List for the first time indicating CDC’s support for the use of these questions. Results from seven states and six large urban school districts that used these questions during 2001–2009 were then summarized in a previous <em>MMWR</em> Surveillance Summary (<em>9</em>). For the 2015 YRBSS cycle, on the basis of substantial support from the state and large urban school district YRBS coordinators, the two questions ascertaining sexual minority status were added for the first time to the standard YRBS questionnaire used by the states and large urban school districts as a starting point for their YRBS questionnaires. The two questions also were added to the national YRBS questionnaire for the first time.</p>

<p>This report provides the first national estimates of the percentage of high school students who are gay, lesbian, and bisexual or are not sure of their sexual identity and the percentage of high school students who have had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes. In addition, this report summarizes results for 118 health-related behaviors plus obesity, overweight, and asthma from the 2015 national YRBS by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Results from 25 state and 19 large urban school district surveys that added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual minority status and had weighted data for the 2015 YRBSS cycle also are included in this report. However, seven states (Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin) and two large urban school districts (Chicago and Shelby County) that added at least one of the questions to ascertain sexual minority status, but had unweighted data, are not included in this report. Among the 25 states and 19 large urban school districts included in this report, two state and one large urban school district surveys were conducted during fall 2014; the national survey, 22 state, and 16 large urban school district surveys were conducted during spring 2015; and one state and two large urban school district surveys were conducted during fall 2015.</p>

<p>Detailed information about the methodology of the national, state, and large urban school district YRBSs has been described elsewhere (<i>10</i>). Information also is available at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs">http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Sampling</h3>
<h4>National Youth Risk Behavior Survey</h4>
<p>The sampling frame for the 2015 national YRBS consisted of all regular public* and private<sup>&dagger;</sup> schools with students in at least one of grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The sampling frame was based on the Market Data Retrieval (MDR) database (<i>11</i>), which includes information on both public and private schools, and the most recent data from the Common Core of Data from the National Center for Education Statistics (<i>12</i>). A three-stage cluster sample design produced a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 who attend public and private schools. The first-stage sampling frame consisted of 1,259 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties, subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. The 1,259 PSUs were categorized into 16 strata according to their metropolitan statistical area (MSA) status (e.g., urban city) and the percentages of black and Hispanic students in the PSUs. From the 1,259 PSUs, 54 were sampled with probability proportional to overall school enrollment size for the PSU.</p>
<p>In the second stage of sampling, 180 schools with any of grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to school enrollment size from within the 54 PSUs. The third stage of sampling consisted of random sampling in each of grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period (e.g., homeroom or second period). All students in sampled classes were eligible to participate. Schools, classes, and students that refused to participate were not replaced.</p>
<h4>State and Large Urban School District Youth Risk Behavior Surveys</h4>
<p>In 2015, a two-stage cluster sample design was used to produce a representative sample of public<sup>&sect;</sup> school students in grades 9–12 in the 25 states and 19 large urban school districts that asked at least one of two questions to ascertain sexual minority status. In the first sampling stage, schools with any of grades 9–12 were sampled with probability proportional to school enrollment size in 23 states and three large urban school districts; all schools with any of grades 9–12 were invited to participate in two states and 16 large urban school districts. In the second sampling stage, intact classes from either a required subject (e.g., English or social studies) or a required period (e.g., homeroom or second period) were sampled randomly in 24 states and 18 large urban school districts, and all students in the sampled classes were eligible to participate. In one state and one large urban school district, all students in sampled schools were eligible to participate.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Data Collection Procedures and Questionnaires</h3>
<p>Survey procedures for the national, state, and large urban school district surveys were designed to protect students&rsquo; privacy by allowing for anonymous and voluntary participation. Before survey administration, local parental permission procedures were followed. Students completed the self-administered questionnaire during one class period and recorded their responses directly on a computer-scannable booklet or answer sheet. CDC&rsquo;s Institutional Review Board approved the protocol for the national YRBS.</p>
<p>The 2015 standard YRBS questionnaire contained 89 questions. This questionnaire was used as the starting point for the state and large urban school district questionnaires. States and large urban school districts could add and/or delete questions from the standard questionnaire. Only two states and three large urban school districts used the 2015 YRBS standard questionnaire without modifications. This report presents state and large urban school district results only from selected questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire.</p>
<p>The 2015 national YRBS questionnaire contained 99 questions including all 89 questions on the standard questionnaire. This report presents national results (along with state and large urban school district results) for selected questions on the 2015 standard questionnaire, plus national only results from eight additional questions measuring usual method of marijuana use, ever use of hallucinogenic drugs, consumption of sports drinks, consumption of water, muscle strengthening exercises, indoor tanning device use, having had a sunburn, and avoidance of foods because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction.</p>
<p>Two questions on the standard questionnaire and national questionnaire measured sexual minority status. Sexual identity was ascertained with the following question: &ldquo;Which of the following best describes you?&rdquo; Response options were &ldquo;heterosexual (straight),&rdquo; &ldquo;gay or lesbian,&rdquo; &ldquo;bisexual,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not sure.&rdquo; All 25 states and 19 large urban school districts included this question. Sex of sexual contacts was ascertained with: &ldquo;During your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?&rdquo; Response options were &ldquo;I have never had sexual contact,&rdquo; &ldquo;females,&rdquo; &ldquo;males,&rdquo; and &ldquo;females and males.&rdquo; No definition was provided for sexual contact. All but two (Arizona and North Dakota) of the 25 states and all 19 large urban school districts included this question.</p>
<p>Except for six demographic questions (sex, grade in school, age, Hispanic ethnicity, race, and sexual identity) and three questions assessing height, weight, and asthma, all the remaining questions on the standard questionnaire and the national questionnaire measured behaviors practiced or experienced by the students (referred to as &ldquo;behaviors&rdquo;). Skip patterns, which occur when a particular response to one question indicates to the respondents that they should not answer one or more subsequent questions, were not included in any YRBS questionnaire to protect students&rsquo; privacy by ensuring all students took about the same amount of time to complete the questionnaire. All questions (except for two questions assessing height and weight and the race question) were multiple choice with a maximum of eight mutually exclusive response options and only one possible answer per respondent. Information about the reliability of the standard questionnaire has been published elsewhere (<i>13</i>). The wording of each question, including recall periods, response options, and operational definitions are available in the 2015 standard and national YRBS questionnaires at <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs">http://www.cdc.gov/yrbs</a>.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Data Processing Procedures and Response Rates</h3>
<p>For the 2015 national YRBS, 15,713 questionnaires were completed in 125 public and private schools. The national data set was cleaned and edited for inconsistencies. Missing data were not statistically imputed. Among the 15,713 completed questionnaires, 89 failed quality control<sup>¶</sup> and were excluded from analysis, resulting in 15,624 usable questionnaires (<a id="T2_up"></a><a href="ss6509a1.htm#T2_down">Table 2</a>). The school response rate was 69%, the students response rate was 86%, and the overall response rate was 60%**.</p>
<p>Data from each state and large urban school district survey were cleaned and edited for inconsistencies with the same procedures used for the national data set. The percentage of completed questionnaires that failed quality control checks and were excluded from analysis ranged from 0.2% to 5.3% (median: 0.8%) across the 25 states and from 0.3% to 6.4% (median: 1.6%) across the 19 large urban school districts. The student sample sizes ranged from 1,452 to 55,596 (median: 2,899) across the states and from 1,052 to 10,419 (median: 2,181) across the large urban school districts (Table 2). Among the states, the school response rates ranged from 70% to 100%, student response rates ranged from 66% to 90%, and overall response rates ranged from 60% to 82%. Among the large urban school districts, the school response rates ranged from 90% to 100%, student response rates ranged from 66% to 88%, and overall response rates ranged from 64% to 88%.</p>
<p>To obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of health-related behaviors by sexual identity subgroups, students who selected &ldquo;gay or lesbian&rdquo; or &ldquo;bisexual&rdquo; were combined into a single subgroup and are referred to as &ldquo;gay, lesbian, and bisexual students&rdquo; as appropriate. Students who selected &ldquo;heterosexual (straight)&rdquo; are referred to as &ldquo;heterosexual students&rdquo; and students who selected &ldquo;not sure&rdquo; are referred to as &ldquo;not sure students.&rdquo; Sex of sexual contact was computed from &ldquo;During your life, with whom have you had sexual contact?&rdquo; and &ldquo;What is your sex?&rdquo; (response options were &ldquo;female&rdquo; and &ldquo;male&rdquo;). To obtain a sufficient sample size for analyses of health-related behaviors by sex of sexual contact subgroups, students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes were combined into a single subgroup and are referred to as &ldquo;students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes.&rdquo; Students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex are referred to as &ldquo;students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.&rdquo; Students who selected &ldquo;I have never had sexual contact&rdquo; are referred to as &ldquo;students who had no sexual contact.&rdquo; Students who had no sexual contact were excluded from analyses on sexual behaviors, female students who had sexual contact with only females were excluded from analyses on condom use and birth control use, and male students who had sexual contact with only males were excluded from analyses on birth control use.</p>
<p>Race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 1) &ldquo;Are you Hispanic or Latino?&rdquo; (response options were &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo;), and 2) &ldquo;What is your race?&rdquo; (response options were &ldquo;American Indian or Alaska Native,&rdquo; &ldquo;Asian,&rdquo; &ldquo;black or African American,&rdquo; &ldquo;Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander,&rdquo; and &ldquo;white&rdquo;). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as &ldquo;Hispanic/ Latino&rdquo; and are referred to as &ldquo;Hispanic&rdquo; if they answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the first question and selected only &ldquo;black or African American&rdquo; to the second question were classified as &ldquo;black or African American&rdquo; and are referred to as &ldquo;black.&rdquo; Students who answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the first question and selected only &ldquo;white&rdquo; to the second question were classified, and are referred to, as &ldquo;white.&rdquo; Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the first question but did not answer the second question.</p>
<p>Students were classified as having obesity or being overweight based on their body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (BMI), which was calculated from self-reported height and weight. The BMI values were compared with sex- and age-specific reference data from the 2000 CDC growth charts  (<i>14</i>). Obesity was defined as a BMI of &ge;95th percentile for age and sex. Overweight was defined as a BMI of &ge;85th percentile and &lt;95th percentile for age and sex. These classifications are not intended to diagnose obesity or overweight in individual students, but to provide population-level estimates of obesity and overweight.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Weighting</h3>
<p>For the national YRBS, a weight based on student sex, race/ethnicity, and grade was applied to each record to adjust for school and student nonresponse and oversampling of black and Hispanic students. The overall weights were scaled so that the weighted count of students equals the total sample size, and the weighted proportions of students in each grade match the national population proportions. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending public and private schools in the United States.</p>
<p>Data from states and large urban school districts that had a representative sample of students, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate of &ge;60% were weighted. A weight was applied to each record to adjust for school and student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction, such that the weighted count of students equals the student population in each jurisdiction. Data from 25 states and 19 large urban school districts were weighted. The weighted prevalence estimates are representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending public schools in each jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Analytic Methods</h3>
<p>Statistical analyses were conducted on weighted data using SAS (<i>15</i>) and SUDAAN (<i>16</i>) software to account for the complex sampling designs. Prevalence estimates and confidence intervals were computed for all variables and all data sets. In addition, for the national YRBS data, t tests (<i>17</i>) were used to determine pairwise differences between sexual identity and sex of sexual contact subgroups. Differences between prevalence estimates were considered statistically significant if the t test p value was &lt;0.05 for main effects (sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts) and for interactions (sex by sexual identity, sexual identity by sex, sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of sexual contacts by sex). In the results section, only statistically significant differences in national YRBS prevalence estimates are reported in the following order: sexual identity, sex by sexual identity, sexual identity by sex, sex of sexual contacts, sex by sex of sexual contacts, and sex of sexual contacts by sex.</p>

<p>Nationwide, 7.3% of all students; 7.2% of heterosexual students; 6.2% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; and 13.1% of not sure students had used an indoor tanning device, such as a sunlamp, sunbed, or tanning booth (not including getting a spray-on tan), one or more times during the 12 months before the survey (i.e., indoor tanning device use) (<a id="T121_up"> </a><a href="ss6509a1.htm#T121_down">Table 121</a>). The prevalence of indoor tanning device use was higher among not sure students (13.1%) than heterosexual students (7.2%) and gay, lesbian, and bisexual students (6.2%). Among female students, the prevalence was higher among heterosexual females (11.7%) than lesbian and bisexual students (5.8%). Among male students, the prevalence was higher among not sure students (18.1%) than heterosexual students (3.4%). The prevalence also was higher among heterosexual female students (11.7%) than heterosexual male students (3.4%).</p>

<p>Nationwide, 10.7% of students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex, 13.0% of students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes, and 2.8% of students who had no sexual contact had used an indoor tanning device. The prevalence of indoor tanning device use was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex (10.7%) and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes (13.0%) than students who had no sexual contact (2.8%). Among female students, the prevalence was higher among those who had sexual contact with only males (18.2%) than those who had sexual contact with only females or with both sexes (11.9%) and those who had no sexual contact (4.1%) and higher among those who had sexual contact with only females or with both sexes (11.9%) than those who had no sexual contact (4.1%). Among male students, the prevalence was higher among those who had sexual contact with only males or with both sexes (16.5%) than those who had sexual contact with only females (4.7%) and those who had no sexual contact (1.4%) and higher among those who had sexual contact with only females (4.7%) than those who had no sexual contact (1.4%). The prevalence also was higher among female students who had sexual contact with only males (18.2%) than male students who had sexual contact with only females (4.7%) and higher among female students who had no sexual contact (4.1%) than male students who had no sexual contact (1.4%).</p>

<p>The question this variable is based on was not included in the standard questionnaire used in the state and large urban school district surveys in 2015. Consequently, the range and median prevalence estimates across states and large urban school districts for the prevalence of indoor tanning device use by sexual minority subgroups are not available.</p>

<h4>Had a Sunburn</h4>

<p>Nationwide, 55.8% of all students; 56.3% of heterosexual students; 52.3% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; and 50.6% of not sure students had a sunburn (including even a small part of their skin turning red or hurting for 12 hours or more after being outside in the sun or after using a sunlamp or other indoor tanning device) one or more times during the 12 months before the survey (i.e., had a sunburn) (<a id="T122_up"> </a><a href="ss6509a1.htm#T122_down">Table 122</a>). Among female students, the prevalence of having had a sunburn was higher among heterosexual students (61.0%) than lesbian or bisexual students (52.7%) and not sure students (48.9%). The prevalence also was higher among heterosexual female students (61.0%) than heterosexual male students (52.2%).</p>

<p>Nationwide, 58.3% of students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex, 58.1% of students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes, and 52.9% of students who had no sexual contact had had a sunburn. The prevalence of having had a sunburn was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex (58.3%) than students who had no sexual contact (52.9%). Among female students, the prevalence was higher among those who had sexual contact with only males (64.1%) than those who had no sexual contact (55.9%). The prevalence also was higher among female students who had sexual contact with only males (64.1%) than male students who had sexual contact with only females (53.6%) and higher among female students who had no sexual contact (55.9%) than male students who had no sexual contact (49.8%).</p>

<p>The question this variable is based on was not included in the standard questionnaire used in the state and large urban school district surveys in 2015. Consequently, the range and median prevalence estimates across states and large urban school districts for the prevalence of having had a sunburn by sexual minority subgroups are not available.</p>

<h4>Avoided Foods Because of Allergic Reaction Risk</h4>

<p>Nationwide, 16.0% of all students; 15.1% of heterosexual students; 23.3% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; and 17.4% of not sure students avoided foods because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction (such as skin rashes, swelling, itching, vomiting, coughing, or trouble breathing) (<a id="T123_up"> </a><a href="ss6509a1.htm#T123_down">Table 123</a>). The prevalence of avoiding foods because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students (23.3%) than heterosexual students (15.1%) and not sure students (17.4%). Among female students, the prevalence was higher among lesbian and bisexual students (25.2%) than heterosexual students (19.1%). The prevalence also was higher among heterosexual female students (19.1%) than heterosexual male students (11.6%) and higher among lesbian and bisexual female students (25.2%) than gay and bisexual male students (15.0%).</p>

<p>Nationwide, 16.5% of students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex, 22.5% of students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes, and 13.8% of students who had no sexual contact had avoided foods because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction. The prevalence of avoiding foods because eating the food could cause an allergic reaction was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes (22.5%) than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex (16.5%) and students who had no sexual contact (13.8%) and higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex (16.5%) than students who had no sexual contact (13.8%). Among female students, the prevalence was higher among those who had sexual contact with only males (20.9%) and those who had sexual contact with only females or with both sexes (24.8%) than those who had no sexual contact (17.3%). Among male students, the prevalence was higher among those who had sexual contact with only females (13.0%) than those who had no sexual contact (10.1%). The prevalence also was higher among female students who had sexual contact with only males (20.9%) than male students who had sexual contact with only females (13.0%), higher among female students who had sexual contact with only females or with both sexes (24.8%) than male students who had sexual contact with only males or with both sexes (15.3%), and higher among female students who had no sexual contact (17.3%) than male students who had no sexual contact (10.1%).</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Discussion" id="discussion" ></a>Discussion</h2>
<p>YRBSS has been measuring sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts at the state and local levels longer than any other public health surveillance system in the United States and has now generated the first national estimates of the size of sexual minority subgroups (as defined by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts) among students in grades 9–12. Other large, national public health surveys (National Survey of Family Growth, National Health Interview Survey, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health) have published estimates of sexual identity subgroups and/or sex of sexual contact subgroups mostly for adults aged &ge;18 years.</p>
<p>Although the majority of the 16,067,000 students estimated to be attending public and private schools in grades 9–12 nationwide in 2015 (<i>18</i>) are heterosexual, this report indicates that approximately 321,000 are gay or lesbian, 964,000 are bisexual, and 514,000 are not sure of their sexual identity. In addition, approximately 273,000 of all students in grades 9–12 have had sexual contact with only the same sex and 739,000 have had sexual contact with both sexes. Sexual minority students are part of every community and are as racially, ethnically, socially, economically, and geographically diverse as their nonsexual minority peers.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether sexual identity or sex of sexual contacts is used to describe sexual minority students, this report documents that sexual minority students have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors compared with nonsexual minority students. For example, across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 16 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 15 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. For nine of these behaviors (did not go to school because of safety concerns; having ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence; sexual dating violence; having felt sad or hopeless; seriously considered attempting suicide; made a suicide plan; attempted suicide; and made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse), gay, lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and for nine of these behaviors (injured in a physical fight; did not go to school because of safety concerns; having ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; physical dating violence; sexual dating violence; seriously considered attempting suicide; make a suicide plan; attempted suicide; and made a suicide attempt that resulted in an injury, poisoning, or overdose that had to be treated by a doctor or nurse) students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of 11 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 10 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. For three of these behaviors (having smoked a whole cigarette before age 13 years, current frequent cigarette use, and current daily cigarette use) gay, lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and for three of these behaviors (current frequent cigarette use, smoking more than 10 cigarettes per day, and current daily cigarette use) students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of 18 was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of 17 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. For nine of these behaviors (tried marijuana before age 13 years, ever used hallucinogenic drugs, ever used cocaine, ever used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever used methamphetamines, ever took steroids without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, ever used inhalants, and ever injected any illegal drug) gay, lesbian, or bisexual students had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and for seven of these behaviors (ever used cocaine, ever used ecstasy, ever used heroin, ever used methamphetamines, ever took steroids without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, ever used inhalants, and ever injected any illegal drug) students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex.</p>
<p>The same pattern also was evident across the six sexual risk behaviors. The prevalence of five of these risk behaviors was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students and the prevalence of four was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. For two of these risk behaviors (had sexual intercourse before aged 13 years and not using any method to prevent pregnancy) gay, lesbian, or bisexual students and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes had a twofold or greater prevalence estimate than heterosexual students and students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex, respectively.</p>
<p>When the results were examined for male and female students separately, the same general patterns emerged for violence-related risk behaviors, tobacco use-related risk behaviors, alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, and sexual risk behaviors. In contrast, no clear pattern of differences by sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups overall or for male and female students separately emerged for birth control use, dietary behaviors, and physical activity. However, the prevalence of not drinking water and not participating in at least 60 minutes of physical activity on at least 1 day during the 7 days before the survey was twofold or greater among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students than heterosexual students.</p>
<p>This report also demonstrates that some students are not yet sure of their sexual identity. Not sure students and gay, lesbian, and bisexual students often have a similar prevalence of many health-risk behaviors and not sure students often have a higher prevalence of many health-risk behaviors than heterosexual students. For example, across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of 15 was higher among not sure students than heterosexual students and across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of 13 was higher among not sure students than heterosexual students.</p>
<p>Further, this report demonstrates that students who had no sexual contact have a much lower prevalence of most health-risk behaviors compared with students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes. For example, across the 18 violence-related risk behaviors nationwide, the prevalence of all 18 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had no sexual contact. Across the 13 tobacco use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of all 13 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had no sexual contact. Similarly, across the 19 alcohol or other drug use-related risk behaviors, the prevalence of all 19 was higher among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex and students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had no sexual contact.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Comparison of Data Across Sites</h3>
<p>Because all the state and large urban school district surveys share similar sampling designs, questionnaires, data collection strategies, and data processing procedures, YRBS data can be compared across the states and large urban school districts. Across states, a substantial difference (i.e., a range of 25 or more percentage points or a fivefold variation or greater) was identified for 17 behaviors among heterosexual students; 38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; 69 behaviors among not sure students; 19 behaviors among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex; 41 behaviors for students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes; and 27 behaviors for students who had no sexual contact. Across the large urban school districts, a substantial difference was identified for 18 behaviors among heterosexual students; 38 behaviors among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students; 58 behaviors among not sure students; 15 behaviors among students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex; 33 behaviors for students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes; and 25 behaviors for students who had no sexual contact. Only eight behaviors (having been electronically bullied, seriously considered attempting suicide, current marijuana use, ever took prescription drugs without a doctor&rsquo;s prescription, having sexual intercourse with four or more persons during their life, eating vegetables three or more times per day, not eating breakfast, and being physically active for at least 60 minutes per day on all 7 days) did not have a substantial difference across any of the sexual identity or sex of sexual contact subgroups among states or large urban school districts. The substantial differences across states and large urban school districts may reflect differences in state and local laws and policies, enforcement practices, access to drugs, availability of effective school and community interventions, prevailing behavioral and social norms (including attitudes toward sexual minorities), the amount of stigma and discrimination, demographic characteristics of the population, and adult practices and health-related behaviors. The differences also highlight how changes in one or more of these factors might contribute to reductions in health-risk behaviors within and across states and large urban school districts among students in grades 9–12.</p>
<h3 class="h3">Public Health Action</h3>
<p>Most sexual minority students cope with the transition from childhood through adolescence to adulthood successfully and become healthy and productive adults. However, some sexual minority students struggle because of the disparities in health-related behaviors documented in this report, particularly violence-related behaviors and alcohol and other drug use, that can be compounded by stigma, discrimination, and homophobia. Because many health-related behaviors initiated during adolescence often extend into adulthood, they can potentially have a life-long negative effect on health outcomes, educational attainment, employment, housing, and overall quality of life.</p>
<p>Schools have a unique and important role to play in addressing the health-related behaviors of sexual minority students. In particular, schools can help reduce stigma and discrimination by creating and sustaining positive school environments which are associated with less suicide ideation and fewer suicide attempts, lower prevalence of substance use, and fewer school absences among sexual minority students (<i>19</i>–<i>22</i>). This might be accomplished through the following policies and practices:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p>Encourage respect for all students and do not allow bullying, harassment, or violence against any student.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; (e.g., counselors&rsquo; offices, designated classrooms, or student organizations) where sexual minority students can get support from administrators, teachers, or other school staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage student-led and student-organized school clubs (e.g., gay/straight alliances) that promote school connectedness and a safe, welcoming, and accepting school environment for all students.</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that health classes and educational materials include information that is relevant to sexual minority students and use inclusive words or terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement professional development opportunities and encourage all school staff to attend on how to create safe and supportive school environments for all students, regardless of sexual minority status.</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easier for students to have access to community-based health care providers who have experience providing health services, including HIV/STD testing and counseling and social and psychological services, to sexual minority youth.</p></li>
<li><p>Promote parent engagement through outreach efforts and educational programs that provide parents with the information and skills they need to help support sexual minority youth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The 2014 School Health Policies and Practices Study (SHPPS) (<i>23</i>) indicates that nationwide during 2014, 21.5% of middle schools and 51.5% of high schools taught about sexual identity and sexual orientation as part of required instruction. In addition, 20.2% of middle schools and 34.6% of high schools provided health services specifically for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students and 17.7% of middle schools and 13.9% of high schools provided services specifically for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students through providers not on school property. Nationwide, 12.0% of school health services coordinators in elementary schools, 10.1% in middle schools, and 16.6% in high schools and 22.4% of school mental health and social services coordinators in elementary schools, 21.2% in middle schools, and 29.7% in high schools had received professional development on services specifically for gay, lesbian, and bisexual students during the 2 years before the study.</p>
<p>Schools address bullying through both policies and practices. According to SHPPS, nationwide in 2014, 98.5% of elementary, middle, and high schools had adopted a policy prohibiting bullying on school property; 90.7% had adopted a policy prohibiting bullying at off-campus, school-sponsored events; 91.2% had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic aggression or cyber-bullying on school property; and 84.8% had adopted a policy prohibiting electronic aggression or cyber-bullying at off-campus, school-sponsored events. In addition, 81.5% of elementary schools, 86.5% of middle schools, and 66.2% of high schools had or participated in a program to prevent bullying.</p>
<p>School Health Profiles (Profiles) (<i>24</i>) provides additional information about how schools nationwide are addressing the health-related behaviors of sexual minority youth. Specifically in 2014, a median of 26.7% of middle and high schools across 47 states had a gay/straight alliance or similar club and a median of 61.4% of middle and high schools identified safe spaces where sexual minority students can receive support from administrators, teachers, or other school staff. During 2008–2014, in 15 of 37 states, significant increases were observed in the percentage of secondary schools having a gay/straight alliance or similar club, and in 26 of 36 states significant increases were observed in the percentage of secondary schools identifying safe spaces for sexual minority students. Nonetheless, these SHPPS and Profiles data demonstrate how much more schools could be doing to address the needs of sexual minority students and the health-risk behaviors they practice.</p>
<p>CDC provides funding and technical assistance to education agencies in 18 states and the District of Columbia and to 17 large urban school districts to help schools implement effective policies and practices to reduce sexual risk behaviors among youth. These programs are focusing increasingly on sexual minority youth as part of their HIV, STD, and pregnancy prevention activities. Examples of program activities include: providing training for district and school staff to ensure that health curricula are inclusive of and relevant to sexual minority students, supporting schools in establishing gay/straight alliances and safe and supportive environments for sexual minority students, linking schools to community organizations that provide sexual health services for sexual minority youth, and developing resources to help school staff understand the special concerns and needs of sexual minority students. In addition, CDC provides funding and technical assistance to 47 states and 21 large urban school districts to conduct YRBS.</p>
<p>State and local education and health agencies are using their YRBS data on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts to inform a variety of policies and programs designed to help reduce health-risk behaviors among sexual minority students. For example, the Connecticut State Department of Education used their YRBS data to identify the needs of populations that are disproportionally affected by HIV, other sexually transmitted infections, and teen pregnancy and help develop <i>Guidelines for the Sexual Health Education Component of Comprehensive Health Education</i> for local school districts on best practice policies, programs, and instruction in sexual health education. The Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education used their YRBS data to describe the health-related needs of sexual minority youth and to support schools in modifying their sexual health curricula and lessons to make them more inclusive of all youth. The state reported that, as a result, differences between the percent of sexual minority youth and all other students who ever learned about HIV in school were reduced. In addition, YRBS data were used in a 2-day training of school counselors, social workers, and nurses to help them understand the risks faced by sexual minority youth in Massachusetts and how their support can help reduce those risks. The Vermont Department of Education used their YRBS data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority students in a series of data briefs to help inform educators and the community about the health-related needs of youth throughout the state. In the District of Columbia, the DC Concerned Providers Coalition used the District of Columbia YRBS data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority students to initiate development of a youth mentoring program for sexual minority youth and the District of Columbia Child and Family Services Agency used their YRBS data on sexual behaviors and sexual minority youth to support the development and implementation of a training program for working effectively with sexual minority youth involved in the foster care system. The District reported that the training program helped reduce complaints from sexual minority youth about unfair or insensitive care while in a placement. The School District of Philadelphia used their YRBS data on sexual minority youth to implement changes in professional development programs for teachers and other school staff to increase sensitivity and understanding of the issues facing sexual minority youth and to provide programming directly for students and parents. The San Diego Unified School District distributed their YRBS data on sexual minority students to superintendents, the Board of Directors, principals, and other key stakeholders to support sexuality education, sexual health services, and a revision to their sexual health education curriculum to include age-appropriate information and build support for gender minority students district-wide. San Francisco Unified School District used their YRBS data on sexual minority youth to support the creation of gay/straight alliances, encourage schools to implement activities during the school district&rsquo;s LGBTQ Pride Month, assist in implementation of curricula inclusive of all students, create school-specific safer school strategies, and increase referrals to and collaboration with community-based organizations that serve sexual minority youth.</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Limitations" id="limitations" ></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>The findings in this report are subject to at least eight limitations. First, these data apply only to youth who attend school and, therefore, are not representative of all persons in this age group. Nationwide, in 2012, of persons aged 16–17 years, approximately 3% were not enrolled in a high school program and had not completed high school (<i>25</i>). Sexual minority youth might represent a disproportionate percentage of high school dropouts and other youths who are absent from or do not attend school (<i>26</i>). Second, the extent of underreporting or overreporting of health-related behaviors cannot be determined, although the survey questions demonstrate good test-retest reliability (<i>10</i>,<i>13</i>). Third, some students might not have known their sexual identity; might have been unwilling to disclose it on the YRBS questionnaire; might have been unwilling to label themselves as heterosexual, gay, lesbian, or bisexual; or might not have understood the sexual identity question. Although the &ldquo;not sure&rdquo; response option for the sexual identity question is a credible choice for youth who might truly be unsure of their sexual identity at this point in their lives, it is also possible that this response option was selected by students who did not know what the question or the other response options meant. Nonetheless, evidence that the words used to describe various types of sexual identity are unclear to youth is not available. Fourth, because no definition was provided for sexual contact, it is likely that students considered a range of sexual activities when responding to this question, possibly including involuntary activities. Fifth, the questions used to ascertain sexual minority status focused only on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts. Questions focused on sexual attraction might have identified a different subgroup of sexual minority students and different estimates of health-related behaviors. Sixth, BMI is calculated on the basis of self-reported height and weight, and, therefore, tends to underestimate the prevalence of obesity and overweight (<i>27</i>). Seventh, not all states and large urban school districts included all of the standard questions on their YRBS questionnaire; therefore, data for certain variables are not available for some sites. Finally, these analyses are based on cross-sectional surveys and can only provide an indication of association, not causality.</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" title="Conclusions" id="conclusions" ></a>Conclusions</h2>
<p>To reduce the disparities in health-related behaviors experienced by sexual minority students, it is important to use this and other reports based on scientifically sound data to raise awareness about the prevalence of priority health-related behaviors among sexual minority students in grades 9–12 among policy makers, the public, and a wide variety of agencies and organizations that work with youth. These agencies and organizations, including schools and youth-friendly health care providers, can help facilitate access to education, health care, and evidence-based interventions designed to address priority health-related behaviors among sexual minority youth. It is also important to continue to implement YRBSS at the national, state, and large urban school district levels to document and monitor the effect of broad policy and programmatic interventions on the health-related behaviors of sexual minority youth. In particular, more states could include questions on sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts on their YRBS questionnaire. Because sexual minority students represent a relatively small proportion of all students, use of large, population-based samples of students is key to obtaining the most generalizable and highest quality data on which to base policy and programmatic decisions that can help eliminate the health-related behavior disparities and improve health status, educational outcomes, and overall quality of life for sexual minority and all youth.</p>
