and season of testing. In addition, clinicians should direct parents to agencies and sources of information that will help 
them establish a lead-safe environment for their children. For these preventive strategies to succeed, partnerships between 
health-care providers, families, and local public health and housing programs should be strengthened.</I>

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Introduction </FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Lead is a common environmental contaminant, and exposure to lead is a preventable risk in all areas of the 
United States. Lead is associated with negative outcomes in children, including impaired cognitive, motor, behavioral, 
and physical abilities (<I>1--4</I>). In 1991, CDC defined the blood lead level (BLL) that should prompt public health actions 
as 10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. Concurrently, CDC also recognized that a BLL of 10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL did not define a threshold for the harmful 
effects of lead (<I>5</I>). Research conducted since 1991 has strengthened the evidence that children's physical and 
mental development can be affected at BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I>1,3</I>).
</P><P>During 2002--2004, a workgroup of CDC's Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention 
(ACCLPP) reviewed the scientific literature regarding adverse health 
effects associated with BLLs &lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, including 
23 published reports that analyzed 16 separate populations with 
Intelligence Quotient (IQ) or general cognitive 
index outcomes and 12 publications related to other health outcomes. In its 2005 report, the workgroup concluded that 
an inverse association exists between BLLs and cognitive function, with no evidence of a weaker association in 
populations 

with lower BLLs (<I>1</I>). The direct evidence for this inverse association was strongest in a study conducted in 
Rochester, New York, that included children born in 1994 and1995, enrolled at age 6 months, and followed for 5 years 
(<I>6</I>). The majority of children studied had BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL throughout the study period. The IQ and blood lead level 
relationship was most accurately described by a nonlinear negative association, with a decrease in IQ of more than seven points 
over the first 10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL increase in lifetime average blood lead concentration. On the basis of the evidence, the 
workgroup concluded that a causal association between lead exposure and impaired cognitive functioning was most likely. 
However, the potential for residual confounding, particularly by social factors, made the strength and shape (i.e., linear 
or nonlinear) of this association across BLLs uncertain. In addition, the workgroup concluded that children with BLLs 
&lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL should not be classified as &quot;lead poisoned.&quot; The report noted that no safe level for blood lead in children has 
been identified (<I>1</I>).
</P><P>Two studies published subsequently have reported negative effects of BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL on developmental outcomes 
(<I>7,8</I>). One study, which included participants from the Rochester cohort 
(<I>6</I>) and from six other past prospective 
studies of children with peak BLLs across a range of values, reaffirmed an inverse association between lead at low levels and 
IQ (<I>7</I>). In these studies, key potential confounders were accounted for, including maternal IQ, the Home Observation 
for Measurement of the Environment Inventory (HOMEI) score (which is a measure of the quality and quantity 
of stimulation and support available to a child in the home environment), 
maternal education, and birth weight.
</P><P>Although ACCLPP has previously reviewed case management of children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I>2</I>), this is the 
first ACCLPP report to summarize scientific information relevant to clinical management of children with BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL. This report also outlines recommendations from ACCLPP to reduce childhood exposure to lead. Information 
on assessing an environmental history and prevention strategies to decrease exposures to lead have been published 
previously (<I>2,3</I>) and are not included in this report.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>ACCLPP provides advice and guidance to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and CDC 
regarding new scientific knowledge and technologic developments and their practical implications for preventing childhood 
lead poisoning, and recommends improvements, as needed. ACCLPP members are selected on the basis of their expertise 
in childhood lead poisoning prevention, blood lead screening, diagnosis, and medical management. ACCLPP 
liaisons represent federal agencies and organizations with particular interest and expertise in childhood lead 
poisoning prevention.
</P><P>In October 2003, ACCLPP formed another workgroup comprising three pediatricians and a CDC health scientist 
to review the scientific literature regarding clinical management options for BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and to outline recommendations for clinical care providers. On the basis of its analysis, the workgroup developed 
draft recommendations that were reviewed and later adopted by ACCLPP in February 2006.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">

</H3>
<H4>
<B>Historic Trends in Children's BLLs in the United States</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Since 1976, BLLs in U.S. children aged 1--5 years have 
decreased substantially (<a href = "rr5608a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>), primarily as a result 
of policies that have reduced the dispersal of lead into the environment 
(<I>9--12</I>). However, many U.S. children continue 
to be exposed to lead, primarily in their homes 
(<I>13</I>). Overt clinical symptoms of lead intoxication are uncommon in 
the United States, and lead evaluation and management strategies typically are intended to reduce the negative effects of 
lead on central nervous system development in children who are clinically asymptomatic. Because no safe BLL has 
been defined (<I>1</I>),<SUP> </SUP>small reductions in population-level exposures to lead will likely affect substantial numbers of children, 
and can be expected to reduce the number of children affected by adverse health outcomes associated with lead 
exposure (<I>14</I>).
<H4>
<B>Blood Lead Measurements</B>
</H4>
</P><P>As with any biologic test, blood lead measurements entail inherent uncertainties as a result of imprecise 
analytic techniques and preanalytic variables (e.g., the specimen collection process). However, the ratio of imprecision 
to measurement value, particularly at BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, is relatively high. The degree of inherent error in blood lead 
analysis varies by analytic methodology used, but whichever method is used, laboratory performance depends on the 
procedures and skills of the laboratory team 
(<I>15,16</I>). Federal regulations allow laboratories that perform blood lead testing 
to operate with a total allowable error of &#177;4 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL or &#177;10%, whichever is greater. Consequently, at BLLs 
<U>&lt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, a laboratory might operate within an error range of 8 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and still meet federal proficiency standards. For example, 
an actual value of blood lead at 7 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL could be reported as being any value ranging from 3 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL to 11 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL and 
still remain within the allowable error limit. A study of duplicate testing of identical blood samples (all with a mean 
blood lead value &lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL) at eight laboratories reported all results as &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and within 3 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL of the overall mean 
for that specimen value (<I>17</I>). A study conducted in 2006 indicated that the majority of blood lead laboratories can 
achieve routine performance of &#177;2 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at concentrations of <U>&lt;</U>10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL without difficulty (<I>18</I>).
</P><P>Blood lead test reliability also depends on adhering to blood collection techniques that reduce sample 
contamination. Collection of capillary blood from a fingerstick into a lead-free collection device is an accepted method for obtaining 
a screening test (<I>19--23</I>) and contamination by lead from the skin surface can be minimized if a protocol for 
proper capillary specimen collection is followed 
(<I>24</I>).<SUP>&#134;</SUP> However, because lead levels from a capillary blood sample will vary 
from those of a simultaneously drawn venous sample, elevated capillary 
results should be confirmed with blood drawn by venipuncture. Multiple studies have reported on the uncertainty introduced by collecting capillary blood rather 
than venipuncture at thresholds of 10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL or 15 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL 
(<I>19--23</I>), but none has examined the sensitivity or specificity 
of capillary methods at thresholds &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL.
<H4>
<B>Children's BLL Patterns</B>
</H4>
</P><P>BLLs increase quickly after an acute exposure, then gradually (over weeks) reach equilibrium with body stores of 
lead. Lead is distributed unevenly within the human body; in children, approximately 70% is stored in the 
bone compartment (<I>25--27</I>). The residence time of lead in bone can be decades 
(<I>28</I>). Thus, an elevated BLL will decline within a few weeks to months after an acute exposure. However, for those children with chronic lead exposure 
and, presumably higher bone lead stores, the decline in BLL can take much longer 
(<I>29</I>). Although bone lead levels can provide information regarding past absorption of lead, measurements of lead in bone using X-ray 
fluorescence instruments are available for research 
purposes only.
</P><P>A newborn infant's BLL closely reflects that of the mother 
(<I>30</I>). During 1999--2002, the geometric mean BLL 
for U.S. women aged 20--59 years was 1.2 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, with 0.3% having a BLL 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I>12</I>). Typically, as infants 
become more active and increase their environmental exposures, BLLs increase. Longitudinal studies of lead-exposed 
children have confirmed an increase in BLLs beginning in late infancy, with a peak level reached at age 18--36 months 
(<I>6,31--33</I>). No studies have examined blood lead patterns specifically for children with peak levels &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, although certain studies have included children with levels this low. A study of children born during 1994--1995 in which &gt;50% of 
the children had peak BLLs &lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL reported an expected pattern in mean BLLs of 
3.4 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 6 months, 9.7 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 24 months, and 5.8 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 61 months (<I>6</I>). A study of children born in 
Boston during 1979--1981 identified mean BLLs of 7.2 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at birth, and subsequent BLLs in these children remained relatively constant (6.2 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 6 months, 6.8 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 24 months, and 6.4 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 57 months) (<I>34--36</I>). In both studies, 
higher levels of lead in home environmental samples were associated directly with higher BLLs in children 
(<I>35,37</I>). In addition, the Boston study demonstrated an association between the occurrence of home renovation and 
increased BLLs (<I>35</I>). The blood lead pattern for individual children with BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL varies depending on their environmental 
exposures (<I>29</I>). More research is needed to better understand age-related patterns for BLLs that remain 
&lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. However, in 

clinical practice, even should additional research data become available, laboratory uncertainty might interfere with 
a clinician's ability to detect patterns for individual children.
</P><P>Once a high BLL has been established in a child, the time required for the BLL to decline to &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL can range from months to years, depending on the duration and dose of 
exposure. For example, for a group of children starting at 
a BLL of 10--14 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL and receiving case management services, the mean time required for 50% to achieve a BLL &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL was 9 months (<I>38</I>). How much time is needed for BLLs 
&lt;10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL to decline in response to interventions 
is unknown.
</P><P>Multiple studies have confirmed that blood lead measurements vary seasonally. For example, a study conducted 
in Boston reported that BLLs were highest in late June and lowest in March 
(<I>39</I>). A Milwaukee study indicated that BLLs were higher in the summer than in the winter 
(<I>40</I>). Some of the variability (higher blood lead in summer) might 
result from increased exposure to lead in dust and soil in summer months 
(<I>41</I>). Blood lead values for urban children 
are predicted to be 1--2 mg/dL higher in the summer than winter months 
(<I>42</I>).
<H4>
<B>Association of BLL Patterns with Developmental Outcomes</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Although BLLs peak in early childhood, when young children are especially vulnerable to lead, negative effects 
are associated with lead exposure at any age. Multiple studies have examined the effects of lead on children's 
development outcomes; in these studies, the ages at which BLLs were measured varied, as did the range of ages over which BLLs 
were averaged (<I>1--4</I>). Statistically significant associations have been identified between average BLLs over a specific 
period (e.g., 0--5 years) and various adverse health outcomes 
(<I>6,43--45</I>); other studies have reported statistically 
significant associations with a single lead measurement at a specific age (e.g., prenatal, 24 months, and 6.5 years) or with a 
peak measurement (<I>6,31,46</I>). Concurrent BLLs (i.e., those measured close to the time of neurodevelopmental testing) 
might demonstrate stronger associations with neurodevelopmental abilities than other blood lead measures 
(<I>6--8,32,47</I>).
</P><P>Lead has a continuing negative association with IQ as children reach elementary school age. For children 
who participated in a trial of chelation therapy, a subsequent data analysis indicated that BLLs measured concurrently 
with developmental testing were associated more closely with children's cognitive abilities than was a peak level 
at approximately age 2 years (<I>48</I>). This association was stronger when children were tested at age 7 years than at age 
5 years, which underscores the continuing need to reduce lead exposures after age 5 years.
<H4>
<B>Strategies to Enhance Children's Positive Developmental Outcomes</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Although lead is a risk factor for developmental and behavior problems, its presence does not indicate that 
these problems will necessarily occur. No characteristic developmental pattern is attributable solely to the effects of lead, 
and measures of the effects of lead on children are imperfect. Thus, for an individual child, neurobehavioral test 
performance might indicate clinically-significant impairments related to lead 
exposures but might not fully capture the array of negative outcomes caused by lead 
(<I>14</I>). The effects of lead at levels approaching 10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL might not be recognizable to either the child's family or clinician or be identified through neurobehavioral testing. However, lead exposure 
might assume greater importance for children with other environmental, 
genetic, biologic, social, or demographic developmental risks factors. Effects of exposures to lead at lower levels might not be evident in testing of 
individual children but are best evaluated on a communitywide basis 
(<I>14</I>).
</P><P>Multiple factors influence a child's development, including how the child is treated by parents or other 
adult caregivers. The child's family and personal psychosocial experiences are strongly associated with performance 
on neurodevelopment measures and account for a greater proportion of the explained variance in these measures than 
BLLs &lt;10 <I>m</I>g/dL(<I>2,43,45,49</I>). A child's blood lead measurement is estimated to account for 2%--4% of variance 
in neurodevelopment measures (approximately 4%--8% of the explained variance) 
(<I>2,43,50</I>).
</P><P>All children benefit from parental nurturing, regardless of their BLL. For example, a child's language skills 
are enhanced by the amount of language addressed to the child (more is better), combined with a predominant pattern 
of positive feedback (<I>51</I>). This pattern of parenting of children under age 3 years has been associated with 
enhanced language and cognitive skills when children were tested in the third grade 
(<I>52</I>). Thus, parents might help counteract 
the negative effects of lead by providing a nurturing and enriched environment during development. Studies to 
examine 

effects of lead have attempted to control for this psychosocial factor by including measures such as the HOMEI 
score (<I>7</I>). Although no studies have specifically evaluated the effects of early intervention programs on cognitive or 
behavioral outcomes in relationship to children's BLLs, several laboratory studies that applied a nurturing environment to 
very young animals during lead acquisition demonstrated the beneficial effect of the social environment on ameliorating 
lead-related negative developmental outcomes 
(<I>53,54</I>).
</P><P>Early enrichment programs, although not tested specifically in relation to BLLs, have been effective in 
improving cognitive development and social competence of young children, particularly infants from families with low levels 
of social or economic resources (<I>55</I>). Research demonstrates that children whose development has been delayed or who 
are at high risk for delay benefit most from interventions applied at an early age 
(<I>56--58</I>).
<H4>
<B>Strategies to Prevent and Reduce Exposure to Lead</B>
</H4>
</P><P>CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend that preventive care for every child should 
include obtaining an environmental history and identifying occupational lead exposure of household members 
(<I>2,3,5</I>). The major sources of lead exposure among U.S. children are lead-contaminated dust, deteriorated lead-based paint, and 
lead-contaminated soil (<I>37,59</I>). Typically, lead contamination of water contributes less to a child's lead burden than 
home and soil sources (<I>59</I>); however, if additives to water (e.g., those used in disinfection processes), are changed, 
the contribution of lead contamination might be greater 
(<I>60</I>). The extent of lead paint hazards (i.e., the presence of lead 
in an accessible condition, such as deteriorated lead-based paint or 
lead-contaminated dust or soil) on interior and 
exterior surfaces and in soil is associated with increased BLLs in children 
(<I>59</I>). Children also are exposed to nonhousing 
lead sources (e.g., lead in foods, cosmetics, pottery, folk remedies, and toys) 
(<I>2,3,61</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Home-Related Lead Exposure</B>
</P><P>An estimated 4.1 million homes in the United States (25% of U.S. homes with children aged &lt;6 years) have a 
lead-based paint hazard (<I>13</I>). An estimated 68% of U.S. homes built before 1940 have lead hazards, as do 43% of 
those built during 1940--1959 and 8% of those built during 1960--1977; estimates are higher for homes in the 
Northeast and Midwest and for homes in which young children reside 
(<I>13</I>). Despite considerable attention and resources 
from federal, state, and local agencies and advocacy groups, publicly available funding has not been able to provide 
sufficient resources to eliminate all lead paint hazards from U.S. homes. Publicly funded home inspections are most often 
limited to homes of children with elevated BLLs; the blood lead threshold value that prompts an inspection varies by state 
or municipality (<I>62</I>). In addition, even when a child's elevated BLL triggers an inspection, public funding for repairs 
to reduce or eliminate identified lead hazards typically is not available.
</P><P>Since 1991, lead-hazard--control grant programs through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development's (HUD) Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control (OHHLHC) have provided funding for local and 
state agencies to reduce lead and other environmental hazards in privately owned low-income housing. In 2005, 
OHHLHC allocated $139 million for this purpose, administered through seven different grant types. Other federal 
programs provide funding to eliminate lead-based paint hazards in federally 
assisted housing. Typically, the focus of these programs is on housing rehabilitation and activities that remediate lead hazards after children are identified 
with elevated BLLs, but HUD-funded local programs also now include primary prevention interventions that control 
or eliminate lead before children are exposed.
</P><P>CDC is working with HUD, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), state and local health department 
lead poisoning prevention grantees, and child health and environmental justice advocates to promote primary 
prevention strategies to reduce exposure to lead 
(<I>1,63,64</I>). In addition to their traditional role of providing services to children 
with elevated BLLs, CDC-funded state and local lead poisoning prevention programs have been charged with 
implementation of housing-based primary prevention strategies in their jurisdictions. This moves beyond their traditional role 
of providing services to children with elevated BLLs and involves developing responses to local risks and a focus 
on identifying and remediating housing-based lead hazards. ACCLPP recommendations for essential elements for state 
and local primary prevention plans have been published previously 
(<I>63</I>), and strategies that have been implemented at 
the state and local levels to address the problem also have been outlined previously 
(<I>64</I>). As ACCLPP noted, implementation of state and local primary prevention plans will require 1) targeting the highest risk areas, populations, and activities; 
2) 

fostering political will for jurisdictions to provide an adequate level of funding; 3) expanding resources for 
housing remediation; identification and correction of lead hazards; and 4) establishing a regulatory infrastructure to create 
and maintain lead-safe housing and to support the use of lead-safe construction work practices 
(<I>63,65</I>). Links to state and local health department web sites, which include their primary prevention plans, are available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/grants/contracts/CLPPP%20map.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/grants/contracts/CLPPP%20map.htm</a>.
</P><P>Certain state and local health departments initiate case management services and home inspections when BLLs 
reach 10 <I>m</I>g/dL. As more primary prevention strategies are implemented, the number of health departments pursuing 
home inspections when BLLs reach 10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL will likely increase. Certain communities have developed online registries to 
help parents identify homes that are lead-safe or that have lead 
hazards (<I>66</I>).
</P><P>
<B>Steps to Identify and Safely Reduce Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Homes</B>
</P><P>Lead-based paint hazards in homes are important sources of lead exposure. Preventive actions can be implemented 
to identify and address these hazards. Tenants can request a copy of all lead testing reports for housing sites from 
landlords at any time. Their landlord should have been provided with such information when they purchased the 
building; compliance with a tenant request for a copy of all lead testing reports is required by federal law 
(<I>67</I>). In addition, federal regulations require sellers and landlords 1) to disclose the possible presence of lead-based paint in any 
pre-1978 property and 2) to provide information on known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards at the time 
final agreements are signed on the purchase or rental of most housing built before 1978 (e.g., by providing results of any 
past evaluations of the property for lead) 
(<I>67</I>). Prospective buyers or renters have the opportunity to arrange for a 
lead inspection or risk assessment by a qualified professional at their own expense; buyers have up to 10 days to check 
for lead. Further, the law requires sellers, landlords, and renovators to provide buyers, renters, and those hiring 
renovators with an EPA-approved pamphlet, &quot;Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home&quot; 
(<I>68</I>). To protect their children from lead, parents might choose not to buy or rent a property or to negotiate remediation of identified lead hazards. 
However, landlords or homeowners might not know whether their property has any lead-based paint or lead 
hazards.
</P><P>Lead-based paint hazards are likely to be present in older homes; all homes built before 1978 should be 
presumed either to have a lead hazard present or to contain intact lead-based paint unless a licensed lead inspector has 
determined otherwise. Lack of a deteriorated surface decreases the likelihood of lead-contaminated dust being present but does 
not ensure its absence. Knowledge of general characteristics of lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards and 
their control might help parents to understand their home better (<a href = "rr5608a1.htm#box">Box</a>) 
(<I>69--73</I>).
</P><P>Screening for lead dust hazards through dust wipe testing (i.e., standardized collection of dust by wiping surfaces 
and measurement of lead collected) can help identify areas of concern. Because lead is not distributed uniformly within 
a home, wipe testing neither ensures absence of lead hazards at locations in the home that were not tested, nor does 
it ensure future protection from lead dust hazards if lead-painted surfaces subsequently deteriorate or are 
disturbed. Potential sources of future contamination include lead-containing paint on areas disturbed by impact/friction 
(e.g., windows, doors, and floors) and the interior migration of lead-contaminated exterior dust and soil 
(<I>70</I>). However, identifying lead dust hazards in the home is a first step toward protecting children and might help parents lower 
lead dust levels in their homes (<I>74</I>). Proper training is recommended for those collecting dust wipes to focus tests on areas 
at highest risk (<I>63</I>). Parents or property owners who wish to perform dust wipe sampling may consult their local health 
or housing departments for advice regarding sampling procedures, interpretation of 
results, and further actions based on results.
</P><P>For a lead-safe environment to be established in older buildings, repair of lead hazards and careful attention 
to maintenance is necessary. However, local ordinances typically do not require action until a child's BLL is elevated, 
and property owners might be unaware of lead hazards or ignore them. Primary prevention is possible only if the focus 
on safety in older housing is increased and lead hazards are repaired proactively before a child is exposed. In all 
pre-1978 properties, owners should use lead-safe work techniques when implementing routine maintenance to decrease 
the likelihood of lead hazards developing in a home.
</P><P>Home renovation or repair is known to be a risk factor for increasing or elevated BLLs, principally through 
exposures to the dust residue generated during the work 
(<I>35,75--77</I>). All contractors who perform repair and renovation work 
in older housing should be trained in lead-safe work practices and comply with any state and local requirements 
governing work with lead paint hazards (<I>78</I>). Property owners doing work themselves should seek expert advice and training 
to 

protect themselves and their families 
(<I>79,80</I>). Lead-safe work practices include 1) relocating families when the 
work warrants, 2) minimizing the amount of dust created, 3) containing dust in the work area, 4) cleaning up completely, 
5) disposing of waste safely, and 6) performing clearance testing (i.e., testing of dust for lead after site clean up) to 
ensure that residual lead levels do not exceed EPA standards 
(<I>81</I>). Families with young children should be restricted from 
work areas until clearance testing has been performed and the area has been judged safe.
</P><P>In previous evaluation studies, lead dust clearance standards were not low enough to protect children from 
increased exposures to lead-contaminated dust after lead hazard remediation; as a result, after home repairs, BLLs of children 
with preremediation BLLs &lt;25 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL increased 
(<I>82</I>). In 2001, the EPA's lead dust clearance standards were lowered to 40 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP> for floors, 250 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP> for windowsills, and 400 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP> for window wells 
(<I>81</I>). No studies have evaluated if these 
lower clearance levels protect children whose BLLs are &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL adequately from ongoing lead exposure. A 
cross-sectional study estimated that 20% of children with a current exposure to floor dust-lead at 40 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP> will have BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I>83</I>).
</P><P>A study conducted in 1994--1999 in 14 U.S. cities involving 2,682 pre-1978 homes demonstrated reductions in 
lead dust levels and fall in children's BLLs when lead-safe work practices were used during remediation efforts 
(<I>69,84,85</I>). The study applied lead dust clearance standards substantially less stringent than those currently in place, 
although clearance floor dust lead levels were generally low (geometric mean: 
16 <I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP>) (<I>86</I>). However, among the 869 
children in this study who were tested within 4 months before home lead remediation and approximately 7 weeks 
after remediation, 81 (9.3%) had a clinically significant increase 
(<U>&gt;</U>5 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL) in BLLs; infants, children of 
less-educated mothers, and children from homes with higher numbers of preintervention exterior lead hazards were at highest 
risk (<I>87</I>). Dust lead levels at clearance were not associated significantly with an increase in BLLs. The study listed 
multiple types of exposures (e.g., other homes, parental job exposures) that might have accounted for increasing BLLs, but 
these were not evaluated systematically. Although lead remediation work reduced overall lead dust and BLLs, the finding 
that &gt;9% of children had a rise in BLL of 
<U>&gt;</U>5 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL underscores the need to maintain a high level of vigilance to ensure 
that children are protected when homes or apartments undergo renovation and repair.
</P><P>
<B>Educational Strategies</B>
</P><P>Lead exposure prevention strategies for children with BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL typically focus on education and promotion 
of home cleanliness, without further identifying lead hazards or repairing them. Providing low-income parents with 
lead-related education via video in a pediatric office has been demonstrated to be effective in increasing knowledge 
and parental report of compliance with lead prevention actions in the home 
(<I>88</I>). No studies have evaluated 
office-based education with accompanying in-home strategies or used children's BLLs as the outcome measure for an 
office-based education strategy.
</P><P>Studies of children at high risk that applied intervention strategies in the home or community have demonstrated 
the failure of education and nonprofessional cleaning conducted alone (i.e., in the absence of other measures to reduce 
lead exposure) in preventing the development of BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I>2,89--91</I>). Few studies have applied prospective 
designs that included control groups. One study indicated that a highly intensive education program starting at birth 
and lasting for <U>&gt;</U>3 years (28 sessions) delivered by community members lowered the risk of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL 34%, but this result was not statistically significant 
(<I>92</I>). Repeated in-home lead prevention education, even when accompanied 
by complimentary supplies of cleaning materials, was ineffective in lowering the incidence of elevated BLLs 
(<I>93,94</I>). A review of four studies 
(<I>90</I>) involving caregiver education 
(<I>94,95</I>) and professional house cleaning 
(<I>96,97</I>) indicated that such low-cost interventions reduced the overall proportion of children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>15 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL or <U>&gt;</U>20 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, but the effect on mean BLLs was not statistically significant (p&gt;0.05).
</P><P>Intensive cleaning regimens reduce lead levels; in one study, biweekly professional cleaning resulted in a 17% 
decrease in mean BLLs after 1 year (<I>96</I>). However, the benefit of such intense and repeated cleaning was limited to 
homes without carpets (<I>98</I>). Intense cleaning can be used without subjecting children to a risk for increased lead exposure 
from unsafe repair methods (i.e., those not in compliance with lead-safe work practices). A single intensive cleaning alone 
does reduce levels of lead in dust by 32% to 93% depending on surface tested and starting lead concentration 
(<I>99</I>), but reaccumulation occurs within 3--6 months 
(<I>100,101</I>).
</P><P>A study that involved children with BLLs 15--19 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL compared the effects of nurse home visits (five visits during 
1 year) accompanied by lead dust tests with those of usual care (one or two visits by an outreach worker during 1 
year) 

(<I>74</I>). After 1 year, dust lead levels were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in homes where lead dust tests had been 
conducted during intervention than in usual care homes. This finding suggests that dust testing might help parents 
better understand lead hazards and take action to lower them. However, changes in dust lead were not mirrored by changes 
in BLLs in this group of children with elevated BLLs.
<H4>
<B>Blood Lead Screening Strategies </B>
</H4>
</P><P>CDC (<I>102</I>) and AAP (<I>3</I>) have recommended that health-care providers conduct blood lead tests on children 
enrolled in Medicaid and those identified as being at risk on the basis of the state or local screening plan or the risk 
assessment process. Federal policy requires that all children enrolled in Medicaid receive screening blood lead tests at ages 12 
and 24 months and that blood lead screening be performed for children aged 36--72 months who have not been 
screened previously (<I>103</I>). Despite this, blood lead screening rates for Medicaid children have been low (&lt;20%) 
(<I>104</I>) and in certain areas remain at approximately 20% 
(<I>105</I>). In 1997, CDC requested state and local health officials to use 
local communitywide data (e.g., BLL prevalence, housing age, and poverty status) to develop plans for blood lead 
screening for their jurisdictions and provide them to clinicians 
(<I>102</I>). These plans recommend either universal or targeted 
blood lead screening. State and local screening plans are available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/grants/contacts/CLPPP%20Map.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/grants/contacts/CLPPP%20Map.htm</a>.
</P><P>Targeted screening strategies enable clinicians to assess risks for individual children and recommend blood lead 
testing for a subset of children in the jurisdiction thought to be at 
increased risk for lead exposure. CDC recommends that 
risk evaluations be conducted on the basis of such factors as residence in a geographic area, membership in a group at 
high risk, answers to a personal-risk assessment questionnaire (which might include local factors such as cultural practices 
or products, such as herbal remedies, traditional cosmetics or imported spices), or other risk factors relevant to 
the jurisdiction (<I>102</I>).
</P><P>CDC recommends that locally developed targeted risk 
assessment and blood lead screening strategies be applied 
at ages 1 and 2 years (<I>102</I>). Children aged 36--72 months who have been identified as being at risk and who have 
not been screened previously also should receive a blood lead test 
(<I>102</I>). For clinicians in areas that lack a state or 
local screening plan, CDC recommends that a blood lead test be performed on all children at ages 1 and 2 years and 
on children aged 36--72 months who have not been screened previously 
(<I>102</I>).
</P><P>Because lead exposures might change with a child's developmental progress (e.g., walking or reaching window sills) 
or as a result of external factors (e.g., family relocation or home remodeling), two routine screenings are recommended 
(at approximately ages 1 and 2 years). Among children in Chicago at high risk with BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL at age 1 year, 21% had a BLL of 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL when tested again at age 
<U>&gt;</U>2 years (<I>103</I>). This report does not change current 
CDC recommendations in ages for routine blood lead testing. However, certain 
local health departments (e.g., those in Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) recommend blood lead screening at 
younger ages or more frequently (<I>106--108</I>). For example, these departments recommend BLL testing starting at ages 
6--9 months in high risk areas, blood lead testing at more frequent intervals (e.g., every 6 months) for children aged &lt;2 
years, or the provision of additional education and more rapid follow-up blood lead testing for children aged &lt;12 months 
with BLLs 6--9 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL.
<H4>
<B>Personal Lead Risk Assessment Questionnaires</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The effectiveness of personal risk assessment questionnaires in identifying children with elevated BLLs has 
been documented in the scientific literature (<a href = "rr5608a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>) 
(<I>109--125</I>). However, no studies have evaluated the performance 
of these questionnaires at cut-off levels &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL or their effectiveness in directing counseling or in identifying 
lead hazards in the home. When applied in consecutive samples of patients in clinical settings, the sensitivity of 
such questionnaires to identify children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL varies considerably by population 
(<I>109--128</I>). In certain studies, the sensitivity 
improved if higher cut-off levels were used in the analysis 
(<I>103,115,119,120</I>) or if the questions used were developed 
specifically for the population tested 
(<I>113,116,117,119,120,122</I>). In general, to 
identify approximately 80% of children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, a blood test had to be performed for more than half of 
those 

children whose risk factors for lead exposure were assessed using a questionnaire. Multiple studies in populations 
with low (<I>109,110,112--114, 127,128</I>) or high 
(<I>123,124</I>) prevalence for elevated BLLs concluded that risk 
assessment questionnaires were not effective in their clinical settings.
<H4>
<B>Future Research Needs</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Further study is needed to assess the effects of BLLs &lt;10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL on children. Such research will entail following 
large and diverse populations, with careful attention to potential confounders and measurements of social factors. 
Additional research also is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies to lower exposures to lead. This should include 
research on the effectiveness of strategies applied in the medical office and home and those that provide interventions 
through medical, public health, and environmental means.
</P><P>Blood lead screening strategies should be evaluated to 
determine the most appropriate ages for screening and 
the utility of screening strategies applied at the community level. Evaluations of lead surveillance strategies should test 
ways to identify changing patterns of environmental risks and subpopulations exposed to established and emerging sources 
of lead. In addition, better ways should be identified to alert public and clinical health-care professionals of changes 
in exposure sources and patterns and to enhance their response to such changes by increased surveillance and blood 
lead monitoring of populations identified as being at increased risk for exposure. Additional studies might provide data 
that can be used to improve laboratory methods and performance monitoring. This will require developing criteria to 
evaluate individual laboratories and mechanisms to provide this information to clinicians.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Summary of Recommendations</FONT></B>
</H3>
<H4>
<B>For Clinicians</B>
</H4>
</P><UL>
<LI>Provide anticipatory guidance to parents of all young children regarding sources of lead and help them 
identify sources of lead in their child's environment. Obtain an environmental and family occupational history and 
educate parents about the most common sources of childhood lead exposure for their child and in their 
community. Encourage parents to identify lead hazards and sources in their homes and reduce their child's potential 
for exposure to lead, including the safe implementation of control measures before BLLs increase. Warn parents 
about the dangers poised by unsafe renovation methods and to be cognizant of the possibility of new and 
reemerging sources of lead in children's environments. Direct parents to local, state, and federal agencies and organizations 
for information, particularly concerning methods to identify and safely repair lead hazards (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5608a2.htm">Appendix</a>).
<LI>Help parents to understand the uncertainty of a blood lead value and potential reasons for its 
fluctuation, including error introduced by the sampling methods and laboratory-, age-, and season-related exposures.
<LI>Assess all children for developmental and behavior status and seek further evaluation and therapy to 
reduce developmental or behavioral problems, as necessary. Consider the potential influences of lead when 
conducting developmental screening. For children with multiple developmental risk factors, which might include 
lead exposures, consider more frequent developmental surveillance or conduct more extensive developmental evaluations.
<LI>Discuss with parents the potential impact of lead on child development and promote strategies that foster 
optimum development, including encouraging parents to influence their child's development positively by 
providing nurturing and enriching experiences. For all children from economically and socially low-resource families living 
in areas where exposure to lead is likely, promote participation in early enrichment programs regardless of the 
child's BLL.
<LI>Whenever possible, utilize laboratories that can achieve routine performance of &#177;2 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL for blood lead analysis. Evaluate laboratory performance by reviewing the laboratory's quality control chart or statistical 
quality control summary.
<LI>Review office procedures and policies to ensure that lead exposure risk assessment or blood lead screening 
is performed on all children as required by state or local health officials or as recommended by CDC. Consider 
the child's age, season of testing, and exposure history when deciding when to obtain follow-up blood lead tests. For 
a child whose BLL is approaching 10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, more frequent blood lead screening (i.e., more than annually) might 
be appropriate, particularly if the child is aged &lt;2 years old, was tested at the start of warm weather when BLLs tend 
to increase, or is at high risk for lead exposures. 

<LI>Perform a diagnostic blood lead test on all children suspected of having lead exposure or an elevated BLL 
and institute the recommended management guidelines if a child's BLL increases to 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL.
<LI>Become informed about lead exposure prevention strategies of local or state health departments and partner 
with public health agencies, community groups, and parents to work toward establishing lead-safe environments 
in homes and schools for all children and the reduction of exposure to lead from all sources. Advocate for 
the expansion of services that foster lead poisoning primary prevention.
