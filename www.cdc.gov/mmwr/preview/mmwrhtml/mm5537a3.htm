<H1>Effects of Measles-Control Activities --- African Region, 1999--2005</FONT></H1>
</P><P>In 1999, of approximately 871,000 deaths from measles worldwide, 61% occurred in sub-Saharan Africa 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5509a8.htm">1</a></I>). In 2001, countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region 
began an accelerated measles-control program to reduce 
by half by 2005 the number of deaths that were caused by measles in 1999 
(<I>2</I>). The African Region accelerated measles-control program was based on four strategies: improving routine vaccinations; providing a second opportunity 
for measles vaccination through a routine, 2-dose vaccination schedule or through supplementary immunization activities 
(SIAs)*; improving measles case management; and establishing case-based surveillance with laboratory confirmation for all 
suspected measles cases. Seven countries in the region had already completed catch-up SIAs by 2000, before the regional program 
began; in 2001, additional countries in the region began implementing catch-up, and later, follow-up 
SIAs,<SUP>&#134;</SUP> and steps were taken to 

improve routine vaccination coverage with measles vaccine and other vaccines in the Expanded Programme on 
Immunization schedule.<B> </B>This report summarizes the nationwide SIAs and other measles-control activities conducted in the WHO 
African Region during 1999--2004, analyzes the trends in 
reported measles cases since 1990, and compares the annual number 
of measles cases reported in 2005 with those reported in 
1999.<SUP>&#167;</SUP>
<H4>
<B>Immunization Activities</B>
</H4>
</P><P>WHO and UNICEF publish annual country-specific estimates of routine measles vaccination coverage; these estimates 
are based on reviews of vaccination coverage surveys, national reports, administrative coverage data, and consultation 
with regional and local experts (<I>3</I>). According to these estimates, coverage with 1 dose of measles vaccine in the African 
Region among children aged 12--23 months increased from 52% in 1999 to 67% in 2004. In 2004, 37 of the region's 46 
countries were estimated to have coverage rates &gt;60%, and 17 countries were estimated to have coverage rates 
<U>&gt;</U>80% (<I>4</I>).
</P><P>By 2000, seven countries in the African Region had completed national catch-up SIAs, and during December 
2001--December 2004, 25 additional countries completed national catch-up SIAs. Ten of these 
32<B> </B>completed national follow-up SIAs. Measles vaccination coverage rates during these SIAs were &gt;90%, except for the catch-up SIAs in Republic of the 
Congo (78%), Eritrea (82%), Ethiopia (87%), and Gabon (80%) and the follow-up SIAs in Lesotho (75%), Swaziland (81%), 
and Zimbabwe (85%). By December 2004, a total of 207.9 million children in 32 countries had been targeted by catch-up 
SIAs, which is 69% of the population of children aged &lt;15 years in the African Region. During the same 
period, 16.1 million children aged 9--59 months in 10 countries were targeted by follow-up SIAs, which represents 14% of the population 
of children aged &lt;5 years in the African Region. 
<H4>
<B>Measles Surveillance</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Since the 1980s, the annual number of country-specific measles cases has been reported by the country's ministry of 
health each year to WHO's Regional Office for Africa. Before implementing catch-up SIAs, all countries reported measles cases 
to WHO through routine infectious disease information systems that provided aggregated data. The cases reported through 
this surveillance system were not laboratory confirmed; they were reported on the basis of clinical suspicion. 
</P><P>After conducting their catch-up SIAs, countries began implementing a case-based surveillance system with 
laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases. In this system, each case is reported using an individual case-report form, and a 
blood specimen is obtained for measles immunoglobulin M (IgM) testing at a national laboratory. When a cluster of three or 
more cases from a health-facility catchment area has been confirmed, subsequent cases from that area are considered confirmed 
by epidemiologic linkage, and blood samples are not collected. The quality indicators used for the case-based surveillance 
system include the proportion of reported cases with a blood specimen (goal: 80% of cases not confirmed by epidemiologic 
linkage) and the proportion of districts reporting at least one suspected case with a blood specimen per year (goal: 80%). For Niger 
and Tanzania, the total number of cases with a blood specimen was &lt;80% of the aggregate case total, so aggregate case totals 
were used for analysis. For all other countries, blood specimens were obtained for &gt;90% of reported cases.
<H4>
<B>Analysis of Surveillance Data</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Countries were grouped according to the year in which they conducted their catch-up SIAs; number of reported cases 
by country group and year during 1990--2005 were calculated 
(<a href = "mm5537a3.htm#fig">Figure</a>). Of the Group A<SUP>&#182;</SUP> countries, six completed catch-up 
SIAs by December 1999, and the seventh completed its catch-up activities by the end of 2000; these countries had a 
measles-elimination goal rather than a mortality-reduction goal 
(<I>5</I>). Group B** consisted of 25 countries that completed 
nationwide catch-up SIAs during December 2001--December 2004. 
Group C<SUP>&#134;&#134;</SUP> consisted of eight countries that did not begin 
catch-up SIAs before March 2005 (except for SIAs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo conducted in 2002 and 2004, 
which collectively targeted approximately half of the country's population aged &lt;15 years).
</P><P>The number of reported measles cases in Group A and Group B countries, which have all completed their 
SIAs, began decreasing steadily as SIAs were conducted (<a href = "mm5537a3.htm#fig">Figure</a>). No decline was evident in the Group C countries; not all 
areas have been covered by SIAs, and yearly fluctuations in the number of measles cases have been observed. 
</P><P>In countries that completed SIAs, the total number of suspected measles cases decreased 93%, from 202,972 in 1999 
to 14,284 (<a href = "mm5537a3.htm#tab">Table</a>); 1999 was chosen as the year for comparison because it is the baseline year for the measles 
mortality-reduction 

goal, and the initial catch-up SIAs in all countries other than the Group A countries were conducted after 1999. The 
number of cases in 1999 was obtained from aggregated reports of cases that were diagnosed on the basis of clinical signs 
and symptoms; few of these cases have laboratory confirmation, and they include other diseases consistent with the clinical 
case definition of measles (e.g., rubella). In 2005, after establishment of case-based surveillance, cases were confirmed by 
a laboratory or through epidemiologic linkage; confirmed case totals were available for all countries except Gabon, 
Liberia, Mauritania, and Sierra Leone. In 2005, aggregate data also were used for Niger because case-based surveillance was not 
fully operational in the country. Tanzania reported 713 possible cases through the case-based system, but because blood 
samples were obtained from &lt;80% of cases, aggregate data were used in the calculations. Countries with no report for 1999 
(Gabon) or 2005 (Madagascar) were excluded from the calculations.
</P><P>To maintain consistency in the case definition, clinically suspected measles cases reported in 2005 (i.e., which include 
cases not counted later after they had negative IgM serology results) were used in the calculations. The 93% decrease during 
1999--2005 in suspected cases demonstrated substantial progress in countries that have implemented accelerated 
measles-control activities. 
</P><P>To minimize the effect of using a single year as a baseline for a disease with cyclic epidemics, reports of suspected cases 
in 2005 also were compared with the average number of 
cases<B> </B>that occurred during 3 years (1998--2000). When the 
3-year average was used as a baseline (N<I> </I>= 200,683 cases), reported cases also decreased 93%.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P><B> </B>The results of this report indicate a consistent and marked decrease in the number of measles 
cases reported from the WHO African Region country groups that completed nationwide measles catch-up SIAs during 
1996--2004. These countries have experienced a &gt;90% reduction in clinical measles cases in 2005 compared with 1999. In 
contrast, the number of reported cases continued to vary widely by year in the group of countries that had not 
completed nationwide catch-up SIAs. Although countries do not report measles deaths to WHO, an analysis of country-level data 
from 13 countries in the African Region that completed nationwide catch-up SIAs during late 2001 to early 2002 documented 
that the percentage reduction in reported deaths from measles was similar to that for reported cases of measles 
(<I>6</I>). The use and analysis of surveillance data in this report suggest that case-based measles surveillance with laboratory confirmation in 
the African Region is providing useful information for monitoring program effects. 
</P><P>The increase from 2,988 cases in 1999 to 3,626 cases in 2005 from countries in Group A (<a href = "mm5537a3.htm#tab">Table</a>) is largely a result of 
the increase in cases reported from South Africa. For example, in 2000, South Africa reported 117 confirmed measles cases 
(<I>5</I>), compared with 609 in 2005. During 2003--2005, South Africa experienced a large, nationwide measles 
outbreak involving 1,676 confirmed cases, the result of measles importation from Mozambique and failure to vaccinate enough of 
the population to prevent endemic measles transmission. 
</P><P>The data in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, data from a single year were used to estimate changes in 
a disease that has cyclic epidemics. However, when the average number of reported cases that occurred during 
1998--2000 (compared with 2005) was used instead of data from 1999 only (compared with 2005), the percentage 
reduction was similar. Second, the system used for reporting cases changed in most countries; in 1999, the countries used aggregated reporting 
of clinically diagnosed cases, but in 2005, most reported laboratory-confirmed cases. Therefore, numbers of suspected 
cases reported in 2005 were used to estimate the decrease in cases during 1999--2005, which might have led to an even 
greater decrease. In addition, although the case definition for suspected measles remained the same, the change from the aggregate 
(in 1999) to the case-based system (in 2005) of reporting might have resulted in underreporting (because of the additional 
tasks of individual case reports and blood samples) or overreporting (because of increased awareness of measles surveillance 
after SIAs).
</P><P>By December 2005, approximately 87% of the population aged &lt;15 years (267.2 million children) in the countries in 
the African Region had been targeted by catch-up SIAs. In 2006, nationwide catch-up SIAs are focusing on the areas that 
have not yet been covered, including 29 million children in southern Nigeria and 7 million children in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo. Successful control of measles in the African Region will depend on conducting high-quality campaigns 
(i.e., campaigns that achieve <U>&gt;</U>95% coverage) in these areas. At the same time, countries should continue to improve their 
routine immunization services, maintain high coverage with follow-up SIAs every 3--5 years, improve measles case management, 
and 

monitor their success by using case-based surveillance with laboratory confirmation to control measles and reach the 
global goal of reducing measles mortality.

<small><P>* Initial, nationwide catch-up SIAs target all children of a particular age group (in this region, children aged 9 months--14 years), with the goal of 
eliminating susceptibility to measles in the general population. Periodic follow-up SIAs then target all children born since the last SIA; follow-up SIAs are generally 
conducted nationwide every 3--5 years and target children aged 9--59 months, with the goal of eliminating any measles susceptibility that has developed in recent 
birth cohorts and protecting children who did not respond to their first measles vaccination.
