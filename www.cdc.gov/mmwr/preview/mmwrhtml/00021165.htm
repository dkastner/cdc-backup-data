<h1>Lead Poisoning Associated with Use of Traditional Ethnic Remedies -- California, 1991-1992 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Exposure to lead-based paint is the leading cause of high-dose

lead exposure among children in the United States. However,
previous reports have documented childhood lead poisoning related
to the use of traditional ethnic remedies (1-4), and such exposures

may not be considered routinely. This article describes a case
report of lead poisoning resulting from use of a traditional ethnic

remedy and summarizes the identification of this problem as a
result of lead poisoning surveillance in California from December
1991 through December 1992.
Case Report </p>
<p>In March 1992, a 2-year-old boy of Mexican origin was tested
for lead poisoning as part of a routine well-child examination in
Los Angeles. His blood lead level (BLL) was 83 ug/dL, a level
classified by CDC as a medical emergency. The child had no apparent

clinical manifestations, and his mother was unaware of obvious
sources of lead exposure, including traditional ethnic remedies.
However, when the term &quot;greta&quot; (a traditional Mexican remedy
employed as a laxative) was used in the interview, the mother
acknowledged giving the boy this remedy regularly since he was 8
months of age.
Analysis of Surveillance in California </p>
<p>From December 1, 1991, through December 31, 1992, the
California Department of Health Services received reports of 40
cases of BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL in children who had

received traditional ethnic remedies (Table 1). BLLs ranged from 20

ug/dL to 86 ug/dL (median: 33 ug/dL). Ages of the children ranged
from 8 months to 5 years (median: 2 years). Of the 36 children for
whom sex was known, 27 (75%) were male. Of the 37 children with
known surnames, 33 (89%) had Hispanic surnames; two (5%), Asian/
Pacific Islander; and two (5%), Asian Indian. More than half (57%)
of the children resided in southern California, 24% in the San
Francisco Bay area, 12% in the Central Valley, and 7% in rural
northern California. By comparison, 72% of all publicly funded
childhood blood lead screening tests were performed in southern
California, 11% in the Bay area, 14% in the Central Valley, and 3%
in rural northern California. </p>
<p>Of the 40 children, 24 were asymptomatic; of these, five had
BLLs greater than 50 ug/dL, including two in whom the BLL was
greater than 80 ug/dL. For 36 of the 40 cases, the traditional
remedies reported were the Hispanic remedies azarcon or greta.
Other remedies were paylooah (Southeast Asia, two cases), surma
(India, one case), and an unnamed ayurvedic substance from Tibet
(one case). In many cases, family members initially denied remedy
use but reported such use during subsequent case follow-up efforts.
 </p>
<p>Results of environmental investigations were available for 18
of the 40 children. For seven of these children, investigators
identified other environmental lead sources at levels that probably

contributed to the exposures. These sources included paint (levels
greater than 5000 parts per million {ppm}, maximum of 150,000 ppm),

bean pots or other large hollowware (leaching greater than 1 ppm
lead), and soil (lead levels above 500 ppm). </p>

<p>Editorial Note: In this report, more than half the children had
clinically inapparent cases of lead poisoning; nearly all were
identified as a result of routine screening of children that had
been initiated in California in late November 1991. All of these
children had BLLs that substantially exceeded the CDC level of
concern (10 ug/dL) (5). Investigation of these cases resulted in
the recognition that traditional ethnic medicines may be used not
only to treat abdominal complaints but also to prevent illness. </p>
<p>Although neurobehavioral development may be impaired in
children with BLLs as low as 10 ug/dL (6-8), overt manifestations
of lead poisoning generally may not be detected until BLLs exceed
50 ug/dL (9). Frank encephalopathy has been noted in children with
levels as low as 70 ug/dL (10). The detection of BLLs greater than
50 ug/dL in children who were asymptomatic underscores the role of
screening as a means for identifying children with dangerous levels

of lead exposure. </p>
<p>The reluctance of family members to report the use of
traditional ethnic medicines during initial interviews may reflect
factors such as uncertainty about the legality of using such
medicines, belief in the effectiveness of these remedies, and
concerns regarding responsibility for the child's elevated BLL. In
addition, because some persons may not consider these substances to

be &quot;remedies&quot; or &quot;medicines,&quot; health-care providers and public
health investigators should ask about the use of these substances
by their common names. </p>
<p>The finding of additional sources of lead probably
contributing to exposure in seven cases underscores the importance
of searching for all possible sources of lead exposure in cases of
lead poisoning. Health professionals serving communities with
high-risk populations should be aware of these high-dose sources of

lead exposure. Education of parents about the risks of
administering lead-containing substances to their children should
be a routine part of health-care maintenance in such high-risk
groups or settings. </p>
