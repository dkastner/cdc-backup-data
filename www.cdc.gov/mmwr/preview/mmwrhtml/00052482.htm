<h1>Silicosis Deaths Among Young Adults -- United States, 1968-1994 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Silicosis is a potentially fatal and typically chronic
fibrotic lung disease caused by occupational exposure to respirable

crystalline silica dust (1). In the United States, most
silicosis-associated deaths occur among persons aged greater than
or equal to 65 years (2), often following many years of silica dust

exposure. However, the continuing occurrence of silicosis deaths in

young adults reflects relatively recent overexposures, some of
sufficient magnitude to cause severe disease and death after
relatively short periods of exposure. This report describes deaths
among two young adults with silicosis and underscores the risk for
deaths from silicosis at relatively young ages.
Case Reports </p>
<p>Two sandblasters died from progressive massive fibrosis (PMF),

an advanced form of silicosis, following intensive dust exposure
during abrasive sandblasting of oil field pipes and tanks in
western Texas (3). The first death occurred in a 36-year-old man
who had worked as a sandblaster for 36 months from 1984 to 1988,
when PMF was diagnosed. He died from respiratory failure in 1995,
11 years after his initial exposure. The second death occurred in
a 30-year-old man who had worked as a sandblaster for 48 months
during 1986-1990. He died from respiratory failure in 1996, 10
years after initial exposure. </p>
<p>At diagnosis, each worker had radiographic evidence of severe
silicosis; one underwent a lung biopsy that revealed silicotic
nodules and fibrosis. Autopsies for both revealed grey and hard
upper and middle lobes of the lungs, with multiple small nodules
palpable in the lower lobes. Microscopic examination revealed
widespread interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, and mineralogic
analysis revealed extremely high silica particle content.
Mortality Surveillance Trends </p>
<p>Using CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
multiple cause-of-death data files for all U.S. deaths from 1968
through 1994, presumptive silicosis deaths were identified using
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes * listed as
either an underlying or contributing cause of death among persons
aged greater than or equal to 15 years. Descriptive analyses were
conducted using three age groups (15-44 years, 45-64 years, and
greater than or equal to 65 years). Usual industry and occupation,
coded in accordance with Bureau of Census industry and occupation
codes, were examined in the NCHS data files. </p>
<p>During 1968-1994, a total of 14,824 silicosis-associated
deaths were recorded; 11,250 (75.9%) occurred among persons aged
greater than or equal to 65 years, 3367 (22.7%) among persons aged
45-64 years, and 207 (1.4%) among persons aged 15-44 years.
Overall, silicosis deaths declined substantially from 1157 in 1968
to less than 400 annually after 1980 (<a href="00052482.htm#00001691.gif">Figure_1</a>). Among young
persons (i.e., aged 15-44 years), deaths from silicosis declined
less during 1968-1994 (<a href="00052482.htm#00001691.gif">Figure_1</a>). Young silicosis decedents
 resided
in 38 states and the District of Columbia (<a href="00052482.htm#00001692.gif">Figure_2</a>); 17 (8.2%)

were aged 15-24 years; 40 (19.3%), aged 25-34 years; and 150
(72.5%), aged 35-44 years. </p>
<p>Among young silicosis decedents, 57.0% were white, and 90.8%
were male. Among silicosis decedents aged greater than or equal to
65 years, 90.0% were white, and 98.1% were male. The proportion of
decedents of races other than white generally increased during
1968-1994 in both the 45-64 and greater than or equal to 65 age
groups, but remained relatively stable among young decedents. In
all three age groups, the proportion of female decedents generally
increased. Of the nine silicosis deaths that occurred among young
women during 1985-1994, six were of races other than white. </p>
<p>Reporting to NCHS of the &quot;usual&quot; industry and occupation of
decedents began in 1985, with varying numbers of states (range:
 16-22
states) providing this information in that and subsequent years
(<a href="00052482.htm#00001692.gif">Figure_2</a>). Of the 59 young silicosis decedents during
 1985-1994,
a total of 25 (42.4%) died in a year for which their state of
residence provided decedents' employment information to NCHS.
Construction and manufacturing were coded most frequently as the
usual industry (28.0% each); no deaths were attributed to mining.
In comparison, among 897 silicosis decedents aged greater than or
equal to 65 years, manufacturing accounted for 46.2% , mining for
21.1%, and construction for 9.5% of deaths. Usual occupations for
the 25 young silicosis decedents included operators of various
machines used to crush, grind, mix, and blend materials (six
{24.0%}); painters/paint spray operators (five {20.0%});
construction trades (four {16.0%}); and laborers, except
construction (four {16.0%}). </p>
<p>Reported by: Div of Respiratory Disease Studies, National Institute

for Occupational Safety and Health; and an EIS officer, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: Primary prevention of silicosis through exposure
control is important because no effective medical treatment exists
for this disease, which continues to progress even after a worker
is removed from further exposure (4). Despite the existence of
legally enforceable limits on worker exposure to respirable
crystalline silica dust, overexposures of sufficient magnitude to
cause premature deaths continue to occur in the United States.
Silicosis latency and rate of progression correlate with intensity
of exposure (5); extremely high exposures are associated with much
shorter latency and more rapid disease progression. Consequently,
silicosis-associated deaths in young persons generally result from
more recent and intense exposure to silica dust. </p>
<p>The sex, racial, and employment differences between young and
older silicosis decedents presented in this report may reflect
changes in both workforce demographics and industrial activity over

recent decades, especially given the increasing proportion of
females among young silicosis decedents. The high, but temporally
constant, proportion of minorities among young silicosis decedents
may reflect the generally higher levels of dust to which minority
workers have been exposed (6,7). For example, in the foundry
industry, higher levels of silica dust exposure accounted for
apparently higher risk for silicosis among black workers than among

white workers (7). </p>
<p>Extreme overexposures to respirable silica have been
documented during sandblasting (5) and in the construction industry

(8). Abrasive blasting with silica sand, often used to prepare
surfaces for painting, has been associated with exposures up to 200

times the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health (NIOSH)-recommended exposure limit for respirable
crystalline silica dust (0.05 mg/m3) (5). NIOSH has recommended
that silica sand be prohibited as an abrasive blasting agent (5). </p>
<p>The findings in this report are subject to several
limitations. The ICD code used to identify presumptive silicosis is

not entirely specific for silicosis, and cause-of-death coding
errors can occur. However, a review of a sample of death
certificates of 10 young decedents in whom silicosis was
presumptively diagnosed found that only two were not attributable
to silicosis. In addition, many states do not provide decedents'
employment data to NCHS, and the Census employment codes lack
substantial detail. Even when recorded accurately and coded
appropriately, silicosis decedents' usual employment does not
always represent employment relevant to silica exposure. Finally,
the NCHS data lack personal identifiers necessary for follow-back
to confirm silicosis as cause of death, to ascertain details about
occupational exposure to silica dust, and to investigate specific
workplaces for potential ongoing hazardous exposure. </p>
<p>The Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks
(SENSOR) program ** and a preexisting surveillance program in New
Jersey have demonstrated that identifying silicosis deaths from
state mortality data files is one of several useful
case-ascertainment methods for state-based silicosis surveillance
and related preventive intervention (9). Although implementation of

all silicosis case ascertainment methods and case follow-up
activities field-tested through SENSOR may be optimal, state health

departments often do not have sufficient resources for a
comprehensive approach. </p>
<p>In 1997, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists
adopted a resolution recommending that silicosis be made a
reportable condition. Regardless of reporting requirement status,
state health departments can initiate active efforts in silicosis
prevention by identifying silicosis deaths through annual review of

state mortality data and giving priority to investigation of
circumstances surrounding those that occur at younger ages.
Additional information about silicosis prevention activities and
technical assistance for worksite investigations and other
follow-back activities are available from NIOSH, telephone (304)
