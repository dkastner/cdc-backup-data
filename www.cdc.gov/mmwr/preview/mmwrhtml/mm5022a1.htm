<H1>Fatal Pediatric Lead Poisoning --- New Hampshire, 2000</H1>

<P>Fatal pediatric lead poisoning is rare in the United States because of multiple 
public health measures that have reduced blood lead levels (BLLs) in the 
population. However, the risk for elevated BLLs among children remains high in 
some neighborhoods and populations, including children living in older housing 
with deteriorated leaded paint. This report describes the investigation of the first 
reported death of a child from lead poisoning since 1990 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001941.htm">1</a>)</I>. The investigation implicated leaded paint and dust in a home environment as the most likely source of the poisoning. 
Lead poisoning can be prevented by correcting lead hazards, especially in older 
housing, and by screening children at risk according to established guidelines 
(<I>2)</I>.
</P><P>On March 29, 2000, a 2-year-old girl was seen at a community hospital 
emergency department with a low-grade fever and vomiting of approximately 1 day's 
duration. The child had been well since arriving in New Hampshire from Egypt with 
her Sudanese refugee family 3 weeks earlier. Laboratory findings included a 
microcytic anemia (hemoglobin: 7.6 g/dL; lower limit of normal: 11.5 g/dL) with 
occasional basophilic stippling of red blood cells. A throat swab streptococcal antigen 
screening test was positive. She was discharged from the emergency department 
with prescriptions for an antibiotic and antiemetic to treat presumed strep throat. 
However, her vomiting worsened, and she was admitted to the same hospital on April 17, 
and then transferred to a tertiary-care hospital the next day. On April 19, approximately 
5 hours after the transfer, she became unresponsive, apneic, and hypotensive. She 
was intubated and placed on a ventilator.  Computerized tomography of the head 
showed diffuse cerebral edema and dilated ventricles.  Later that day, the results of a 
blood test drawn on April 18 showed a BLL of 391 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and an erythrocyte 
protoporphyrin level of 541 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. Chelation therapy was initiated with intramuscular 
British antilewisite and intravenous calcium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Despite 
a decrease in her BLL to 72 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL and treatment for increased intracranial 
pressure, including surgical ventricular drainage, she remained comatose without 
spontaneous respirations, brain electrical activity, and intracranial blood flow. She was 
pronounced brain dead on April 21.
</P><P>An autopsy found diffuse cerebral edema. A hair sample lead concentration was 
31 <I>&#181;</I>g/g in the distal centimeter and 67 
<I>&#181;</I>g/g in the proximal centimeter, indicating a 
large increase in lead exposure during the preceding month. Radiographs of the left 
knee were equivocal for growth arrest lines that can occur in chronic lead poisoning 
(<I>3)</I>. A bone marrow sample showed no stainable iron, indicating iron deficiency.                  
</P><P>On April 19, the Manchester Health Department and New Hampshire 
Department of Health and Human Services (NHDHHS) initiated an investigation, 
including interviews and blood lead tests of the patient's family and an inspection of 
her residence. In addition, to assess a possible contribution of lead exposure from 
the child's previous residence in Egypt, the Field Epidemiology Training Program of 
the Egyptian Ministry of Health<I> </I>obtained soil and dust samples from that location.
</P><P>After living in Egypt for approximately 18 months, on March 9, 2000, the family 
had moved to Manchester into an apartment constructed before 1920. A wall in a 
sibling's bedroom had multiple holes from which the patient had been seen removing 
and 

ingesting plaster. Two of seven samples of plaster with the adhering surface 
paint contained lead at levels of 5% and 12%.  Peeling paint (35% lead) was present on 
the balusters and floor (3% lead) of a porch outside the apartment entrance where 
the patient sometimes had played. She also had played near and looked out of a 
living room window that occasionally was opened during meal preparation. A wipe 
sample of dust from the window well showed 6732 
<I>&#181;</I>g lead/ft<SUP>2</SUP>, well above the hazardous 
level of 800 <I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP> 
(<I>4)</I>. NHDHHS ordered the apartment owner to correct the lead 
hazards identified during the inspection. The patient's family relocated to another dwelling.
</P><P>BLLs in the mother and three siblings (ages 5, 11, and 15 years) ranged from 
4--12 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. The family did not use or possess nontraditional remedies, food 
supplements, cosmetics, or ceramic eating or drinking containers acquired abroad. No one in 
the household was employed or had lead-related hobbies. Measurements of stable 
lead isotopes (<I>5)</I> in selected environmental samples and the patient's blood showed that 
the isotopic lead composition of the porch paint and window well dust in the 
her Manchester apartment matched the composition of lead in her blood more 
closely than did the isotopic composition of other samples, including those from her 
previous residence in Egypt.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
<P> Lead encephalopathy is a life-threatening complication of 
lead poisoning that can occur in young children who have very high BLLs 
(&gt;70--100 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL). Nonspecific symptoms (e.g., lethargy, sporadic vomiting, and constipation) can 
occur at BLLs<I> </I>&gt;50--70 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and may precede the abrupt onset of frank 
encephalopathy characterized by persistent vomiting, ataxia, altered consciousness, coma, 
and seizures. In this report, the child's anemia with basophilic stippling also suggested 
lead poisoning. However, symptoms or signs cannot be used to reliably diagnose 
or exclude lead poisoning; a BLL must be measured whenever lead poisoning 
is suspected. In young children, BLLs &gt;70 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL or elevated BLLs with symptoms suggesting encephalopathy require prompt inpatient treatment with chelating 
agents to rapidly reduce BLLs. Providing appropriate intensive care for children 
with encephalopathy can prevent death, although severe permanent brain damage 
can occur despite treatment (<I>3)</I>.
</P><P>During the 1950s and 1960s, acute, often fatal, lead encephalopathy was 
a common cause of pediatric admissions to urban hospitals 
(<I>6)</I>. The subsequent decline in fatal lead poisoning cases is attributable to reduced lead exposure from 
multiple sources, institution of lead screening programs, and improved treatment of 
lead poisoning (<I>6)</I>. Despite the reduction in severe lead poisoning, in some U.S. 
counties, &gt;20% of young children tested have BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL (<I><a href="mm4950a3.htm">7</a>)</I>, high enough to 
adversely affect learning and development 
(<I>3)</I>. 
</P><P>The likely sources of lead poisoning for the child in this 
report---deteriorated leaded paint and elevated levels of lead-contaminated house 
dust---are found in an estimated 

24 million U.S. dwellings, 4.4 million of which are home to one or more children 
aged &lt;6 years (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, unpublished 
data, 2001). Lead hazards are especially common in homes built before 1960 
(58%). Although the patient's pica and iron deficiency probably contributed to the severity 
of her lead poisoning, by increasing ingestion and absorption of lead 
(<I>3)</I>, all children living in homes with lead hazards are at increased risk for developing elevated BLLs 
(<I>8)</I>.
</P><P>Children who are refugees, adoptees, or recent immigrants may be at 
increased risk for elevated BLLs, possibly related to lead exposure in their country of origin or 
to continued use of certain lead-containing traditional remedies or cosmetics. 
However, such children also are at risk for exposure to leaded paint hazards in older 
U.S. housing. In addition to ensuring that such children are screened after arrival in 
the United States, lead poisoning prevention programs and health-care providers 
should ensure that families receive timely education about lead hazards. Federal 
regulations require that property sellers and landlords provide families with information 
about lead poisoning and about any known lead hazards in a dwelling before its sale 
or lease.* Agencies providing health and social services to refugees and 
immigrants should become familiar with these regulations and ensure that 
appropriate information is provided to families in a language they can understand.
