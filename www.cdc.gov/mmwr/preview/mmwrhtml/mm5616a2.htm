<H1>Fixed Obstructive Lung Disease Among Workers in the 
Flavor-Manufacturing Industry --- California, 2004--2007</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare and life-threatening form of fixed obstructive lung disease, is known to be caused by 
exposure to noxious gases in occupational settings and has been described in workers in the microwave-popcorn industry who 
were exposed to artificial butter-flavoring chemicals, including diacetyl 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5116a2.htm">1</a>,2</I>). In August 2004, the California Department of 
Health Services (CDHS) and Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) received the first report of a 
bronchiolitis obliterans diagnosis in a flavor-manufacturing 
worker in California. In April 2006, a second report was received of a case in 
a flavor-manufacturing worker from another company. Neither worker was employed in the microwave-popcorn industry; 
both were workers in the flavor-manufacturing industry, which produces artificial butter flavoring and other flavors such as 
cherry, almond, praline, jalapeno, and orange. Both workers had handled pure diacetyl, an ingredient in artificial butter and 
other flavorings, and additional chemicals involved in the manufacturing process. Studies have indicated that exposure to 
diacetyl causes severe respiratory epithelial injury in animals 
(<I>3--5</I>).<B> </B>Because the manufacture of flavorings involves more than 
2,000 chemicals, workers in the general flavor-manufacturing industry are exposed to more chemicals than workers in 
the microwave-popcorn industry, which primarily uses butter flavorings. Food flavorings are designated &quot;generally recognized 
as safe&quot; when approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(<I>6</I>); flavorings are not known to put consumers at risk 
for lung disease. This report describes the first two cases of bronchiolitis obliterans in flavor-manufacturing workers in 
California, the findings of the public health investigation, and the actions taken by state and federal agencies to prevent future cases 
of occupational bronchiolitis obliterans. To identify cases and reduce risk for lung disease from occupational exposure 
to flavorings, a timely, effective response is needed, including medical surveillance, exposure monitoring, and reduced 
exposure.
<H4>
<B>Case Reports</B>
</H4>
</P><P><b>Case 1.</b> In September 2003, a man aged 29 years with no history of smoking, lung disease, or respiratory 
symptoms developed progressive shortness of breath on exertion, 
decreased exercise tolerance, intermittent wheezing, left-sided 
chest pain, and a productive cough 2 years after beginning employment as a flavor compounder. His job involved 
measuring diacetyl and other ingredients to prepare batches of powder flavorings. The workplace did not have effective methods 
for controlling exposure to the flavoring chemicals, such as local exhaust ventilation or adequate use of respirators 
to reduce exposure to organic compounds and powders. The worker reported wearing a paper dust mask and occasionally 
a 

cartridge respirator for organic vapors. However, he never received a fit test for the respirator. He had a beard at the 
time, which precluded a proper fit, and he was not adequately protected from both volatile 
organic chemicals and particulates. 
</P><P>In November 2003, the man went to his primary-care physician and was treated with antibiotics and bronchodilators 
for suspected bronchitis and allergic rhinitis. In January 2004, he stopped working because of his respiratory symptoms. 
His shortness of breath became more severe, with dyspnea after walking 10--15 feet. A high-resolution computed 
tomography (HRCT) scan of his chest showed cylindrical bronchiectasis in the lower lobes, with scattered peribronchial 
ground-glass opacities. In April 2004, spirometry showed severe obstructive lung disease, with a forced expiratory volume in 1 
second (FEV<SUB>1</SUB>) of 28% of the predicted normal value, without bronchodilator response. Static lung volumes by 
body plethysmography were consistent with severe air trapping. Diffusing capacity was normal. 
</P><P>In October 2004, the patient was referred for an occupational pulmonary consultation. Paired inspiratory 
and expiratory HRCT scans showed central peribronchial thickening with central airway dilatation and subtle areas 
of mosaic attenuation scattered throughout the lungs, predominantly in the right lower lobe. The diagnosis of 
work-related bronchiolitis obliterans was made on the basis of history, fixed airway obstruction with normal diffusing capacity, and 
typical HRCT findings (<I>7</I>)<I>.</I> Diacetyl is considered the cause of this patient's disease on the basis of its known toxic effects; 
however, exposure to other less well-characterized flavoring chemicals might also have contributed.
</P><P><b>Case 2.</b> During 2002, a nonsmoking woman aged 40 years, who had no history of lung disease or respiratory 
symptoms when she began working as a flavor compounder, experienced nasal congestion and cough after 5 years on the job, 
which involved mixing dry powders with diacetyl and other ingredients to make artificial butter flavoring. The workplace did 
not have exposure-control measures such as local exhaust ventilation, and employees did not use respirators appropriately. 
The worker reported wearing a paper dust mask that had not been fit tested and did not provide adequate protection from 
either volatile organic compounds or particulates. The woman was treated with antibiotics and antihistamines by her 
primary-care physician. She experienced progressively worsening shortness of breath on exertion, decreasing exercise tolerance, and 
a nonproductive cough. In November 2005, she visited a pulmonary specialist who suspected work-related asthma and 
treated her with bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids, producing minimal improvement. An HRCT of the chest showed 
several small areas of patchy ground-glass opacities throughout the lungs. 
</P><P>In December 2005, the patient stopped working because of her respiratory symptoms. Spirometry revealed 
severe obstructive lung disease, with an FEV<SUB>1 
</SUB>of 18% of the predicted normal value, without bronchodilator response. Static 
lung volumes by body plethysmography were consistent with 
severe air trapping. Diffusing capacity was normal. Left 
thoracotomy with wedge resection of the left lower lobe did not indicate bronchiolitis obliterans in this area of the lung. However, 
other findings of peribronchial inflammation, interstitial fibrosis, and non-caseating--type granulomas suggested an 
inflammatory process. The diagnosis of work-related bronchiolitis obliterans was made on the basis of history, fixed airway obstruction 
with normal diffusing capacity, and typical HRCT findings 
(<I>7</I>). 
<H4>
<B>Public Health Investigation and Response</B>
</H4>
</P><P>In response to the two case reports, Cal/OSHA conducted enforcement investigations of the two companies in August 
2004 and April 2006, respectively. The companies were 
required to conduct spirometry screening and reduce employee exposure 
to diacetyl and other flavoring ingredients using engineering 
controls (e.g., effective ventilation, improved work practices such 
as covering containers and minimizing spills), and protective respiratory measures (e.g., appropriate use of respirators 
with particulate filters and cartridges for protection against organic vapors). In April 2006, Cal/OSHA and CDHS implemented 
a cooperative intervention program to encourage the state's entire flavor-manufacturing industry to implement the 
same measures. CDHS used marketing databases, information from the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers 
Association, and a telephone survey to locate 26 additional flavor manufacturers statewide; the total of 28 companies is thought to represent 
this entire industry in California. All of the newly identified companies voluntarily agreed to participate in the program, 
which requires that they conduct medical surveillance of exposed workers, assess and control exposure to chemicals, and 
accept agency supervision of these activities. 
</P><P>The companies are in various stages of establishing their medical programs; by March 1, 2007, CDHS had 
received spirometry results for 419 of approximately 750 employees in the 28 companies (including the two companies in which 
the first two cases occurred). The Cal/OSHA consultation service is conducting or monitoring worksite industrial 
hygiene 

assessments for the participating companies and is evaluating data on exposure to airborne diacetyl and other 
chemicals. Industrial hygienists from CDC's National Institute for 
Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have 
assessed exposures and developed guidance on work practices and 
exposure-control technology for three companies. 
</P><P>Since April 2006, five additional flavor-manufacturing workers have been identified with severe fixed obstructive 
lung disease, for a total of seven workers associated with four flavor manufacturers in California. None of the seven had 
ever smoked; one had a history of childhood asthma. Six (86%) were men. The mean age at which they first sought 
medical attention for respiratory problems was 34 years (range: 27--44). Six of the seven workers were employed as 
flavoring compounders who handled diacetyl and other chemicals when mixing flavorings; three made powdered flavorings only, 
and three prepared both liquids and powders. The seventh worker was a production worker who packaged powder 
flavorings. These companies did not have local exhaust ventilation to control chemical 
exposures. Six workers wore paper dust masks that were not fit tested and did not provide protection from volatile organic chemicals and particulates.
</P><P>Symptoms reported by the seven workers included cough, wheezing, or shortness of breath on exertion, with onset 
ranging from 1 month to 5 years after beginning work in flavor manufacturing. 
FEV<SUB>1</SUB> ranged from 17% to 44% of predicted 
normal value for age, height, race, and sex, and the ratio of 
FEV<SUB>1</SUB> to forced vital capacity ranged from 30% to 61%. None of 
the FEV<SUB>1</SUB> values improved after bronchodilator administration. Initial diagnoses for these employees included asthma, 
bronchitis, and bronchiectasis.
</P><P>In May 2006, CDHS disseminated outreach materials, 
including a diacetyl hazard alert and description of sentinel cases, 
to flavor manufacturers, health-care providers, and worker organizations (available at 
		<a href="http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/flavorings.htm">http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/flavorings.htm</a>). CDHS also obtained current material safety data sheets* from 11 diacetyl manufacturers or distributors 
and determined that five mentioned bronchiolitis obliterans, and none listed potential symptoms or recommended 
medical surveillance for the disease. In addition to the seven persons with identified bronchiolitis obliterans, 22 current workers 
with obstructive abnormalities detected by spirometry are being medically evaluated, and Cal/OSHA is assessing their 
occupational exposure to flavoring chemicals to minimize risk for disease.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The emergence of bronchiolitis obliterans in California flavor-manufacturing workers underscores 
the challenges faced by workers, employers, government agencies, and medical professionals in responding to newly 
identified work hazards. Bronchiolitis obliterans was first identified in flavor-manufacturing workers in 1985 
(<I>8</I>)<I>,</I> although the chemical etiology was not identified at that time. The hazards of diacetyl and butter flavoring were documented in published 
literature in 2002 (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5116a2.htm">1</a>,3</I>). However, by 2006, many flavoring suppliers still had not addressed the risk for bronchiolitis obliterans in 
their material safety data sheets. During 2004, NIOSH and the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association 
disseminated information encouraging flavor manufacturers to implement exposure controls and medical surveillance 
(<I>9,10</I>). These measures were virtually nonexistent in California during 2006, when industrywide government intervention measures 
began. Before June 2006, only eight California 
flavor-manufacturing companies had begun medical 
screening.
</P><P>Bronchiolitis obliterans and fixed obstructive lung disease in the workers described in this report were not 
recognized initially as work-related conditions even though they occurred in young, previously healthy persons who had never 
smoked and had no evident nonwork etiology. Frequently, workers with occupational lung disease have worsening 
respiratory symptoms at work or improvement of symptoms while on vacation. The lack of this work-related pattern of 
respiratory symptoms likely delayed identification of a work-related origin. Single, sporadic cases in workers of a rare disease such 
as bronchiolitis obliterans might not be diagnosed accurately by clinicians or might not be attributed to a work-related 
exposure; initial misdiagnoses might include asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, or bronchiectasis.
</P><P>Safe occupational exposure levels for diacetyl and many other flavoring chemicals have not been established. 
Employers should implement measures to minimize exposure. Engineering controls, including local exhaust ventilation and 
closed transfer of chemicals, should be the primary control measures. Work practices such as covering containers and 
minimizing spills also will reduce exposures. Employers should establish a comprehensive respiratory protection program for 
organic vapors and particulates that adheres to the OSHA 
Respiratory Protection Standard (29 CFR 1910.134 available at 
http://<a href="http://www.osha.gov">www.osha.gov</a>). Consultation with an industrial hygienist 
or occupational safety and health professional might be necessary 
to implement appropriate engineering controls, work practices, and an appropriate respiratory protection 
program.<SUP>&#134;</SUP> 
</P><P>A better understanding of work-related risk factors for bronchiolitis obliterans in the flavoring industry will 
facilitate establishing priorities for preventive interventions. Cal/OSHA and CDHS will aggregate data from the 28 companies 
to identify manufacturing processes and types and concentrations of flavoring chemicals associated with occupational 
lung disease.
</P><P>Evaluation of interventions to prevent bronchiolitis obliterans rely on early detection of abnormal spirometry results 
or unusual decreases in repeated measurements. Beginning in January 2007, with assistance from NIOSH, 
CDHS performed quality checks of submitted screening spirometry results. Many results did not meet American Thoracic 
Society quality criteria (available at 
		<a href="http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/statements/pages/pfet/pft2.html">http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/statements/pages/pfet/pft2.html</a>).
</P><P>Flavor manufacturers and flavored-food producers are widely distributed in the United States. Bronchiolitis obliterans 
has been identified in microwave-popcorn workers in several states, including Missouri, Iowa, Ohio, New Jersey, and 
Illinois; bronchiolitis obliterans in flavor-manufacturing workers has been identified in Ohio, California, Maryland, and New 
Jersey. Although the risk for occupational lung disease has been 
established in the microwave-popcorn industry 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5116a2.htm">1</a>,2</I>) and improvements have been made (e.g., isolating processes, increasing exhaust ventilation, and using respirators), the risk 
for occupational lung disease associated with the use of flavorings during production of other types of food has not 
been established. Additional information for physicians treating workers with respiratory disease who have been exposed 
to flavoring chemicals is available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flavorings</a>, and assistance is available from NIOSH, 
OSHA programs, and state health departments.
