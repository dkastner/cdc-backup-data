Summary </p>
<p>Since 1980, the number of legal abortions reported to CDC has
remained fairly stable, varying each year by less than 3%. In
1986, 1,328,112 abortions were reported; in 1987, that number
increased by approximately 2% to 1,353,671. The abortion ratio
for 1986 was 354 legally induced abortions per 1,000 live births;
the ratio for 1987 was 356 per 1,000. The national abortion rate
was 23/1,000 females ages 15-44 years for 1986 and 24/1,000
females ages 15-44 years in 1987. Abortion ratios were higher
among women of black and other minority races and among women
less than 15 years of age. Women undergoing legally induced
abortions tended 1) to be young, white, and unmarried, 2) to have
had no previous live births, and 3) to be having the procedure
for the first time. In 1987, approximately half of all abortions
were performed before the eighth week of gestation, and greater
than 85% were performed during the first trimester of pregnancy (
less than 13 weeks of gestation).
INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the number
and characteristics of women obtaining abortions and to assist
efforts to eliminate preventable causes of morbidity and
mortality associated with abortions. This report presents
abortion data reported to CDC for 1986 and 1987.
METHODS </p>
<p>For 1986 and 1987, CDC received data from 52 reporting areas:
50 states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. Total
numbers of abortions were available from all reporting areas,
most of which provided information on the characteristics of
women obtaining abortions. Central health agencies* reported data
for 43 areas in 1986 and 45 areas in 1987; hospitals and other
medical facilities reported data for the other nine reporting
areas in 1986 and the other seven in 1987. Data are reported by
state of occurrence unless otherwise noted. </p>
<p>National statistics for 1986, 1987, and selected previous years
are presented in a summary table (Table 1) and in Table 2.
Percentage distributions in Table 1 include data from all areas
reporting a given characteristic and exclude all unknown values.
State-specific characteristics of women obtaining abortions in
1986 and 1987 are presented in Tables 3-12; overall tabulations
of selected characteristics are presented in Tables 13-20.
RESULTS </p>
<p>In 1986, 1,328,112 legal abortions were reported to CDC--0.03%
less than the number reported for the previous year (1). In 1987,
the number increased to 1,353,671, an increase of approximately
2% from the 1986 figure. The national abortion rate decreased
from 24 abortions/1,000 women ages 15-44 in 1985 to 23/1,000 in
1986 and increased again to 24/1,000 in 1987. The abortion ratio
remained stable from 1985 to 1986, at 354 abortions/1,000 live
births, and then increased to 356/1,000 in 1987 (Table 1, Figures
1-3). </p>
<p>In 1986 and 1987, as in previous years, the largest numbers of
abortions were performed in California, New York City, and Texas;
the smallest numbers of abortions were performed in Wyoming,
Alaska, and South Dakota (1,2). For women whose state of
residence was known, approximately 92% had the abortion procedure
done within their state of residence. For both years, the
percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents ranged
from approximately 50% in the District of Columbia to less than
1% in Alaska (Tables 3 and 4). Data on the percentage of
abortions obtained by out-of-state residents are not available
for five reporting areas in 1986 and for seven reporting areas in
1987. </p>
<p>In 1986, 37 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City
reported legal abortions by age; in 1987, 39 states, the District
of Columbia, and New York City reported those figures. In both
years, women 20-24 years of age had approximately 33% of all
abortions, whereas women less than 15 years of age had
approximately 1% (Tables 5 and 6). The abortion ratio was highest
for women less than 15 years of age and second highest for women
15-19 years of age. The abortion ratio for women less than 15
years of age was 1,163 abortions/1,000 live births in 1986 and
1,275/1,000 in 1987; the ratio for women 15-19 years of age was
650/1,000 in 1986 and 668/1,000 in 1987 (Figure 4). Although
teenagers' abortion ratios were the highest during 1986-1987, the
proportion of legal abortions they obtained continued to remain
stable. Teenagers had 25% of all legal abortions in 1986 and 26%
in 1987. Among that age group, the abortion ratio was lowest
among 19-year-olds and highest among those less than 15 years of
age (Tables 7 and 8). </p>
<p>In 1986 and 1987, approximately 49% of reported legal abortions
were performed before 8 weeks of gestation, and 87% were done at
or before 12 weeks of gestation (Tables 9 and 10). Four percent
of the abortions for those 2 years were performed at 16-20 weeks
of gestation, and less than 1% at greater than or equal to 21
weeks of gestation. </p>
<p>In both years, approximately 96% of reported legal abortions
were performed by curettage (Tables 11 and 12). In less than 2%,
the method was intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation. </p>
<p>In 1986 and 1987, almost two-thirds of women obtaining legal
abortions were white; this finding continued a previously noted
trend (1,2) (Table 13). The abortion ratio, however, was higher
for black women and women of other minority races than for white
women: 488 versus 269 abortions/1,000 live births in 1986 and 500
versus 267 abortions/1,000 in 1987. </p>
<p>The percentage of women undergoing legal abortions who were
unmarried fell from approximately 80% in 1985 to 73% in 1986, and
then to almost 70% in 1987. The abortion ratio was approximately
10 times higher for unmarried women than for married women: 958
versus 102 abortions/1,000 live births in 1986 and 1,019 versus
96/1,000 in 1987 (Table 14). </p>
<p>In both years, approximately 53% of the women obtaining legal
abortions had had no previous live births, and approximately 88%
had had two or fewer live births (Table 15). In both 1986 and
1987, the abortion ratio was highest for women who had had no
live births and lowest for women who had had one live birth.
Approximately 55% of women obtaining abortions in 1986 and 1987
had the procedure for the first time, whereas approximately 14%
had had at least two abortions (Table 16). </p>
<p>When the proportions of women undergoing abortions were
analyzed by age group and marital status, few differences were
reported between white women and women of black and other
minority races (Tables 17 and 18). However, the proportion of
black and other minority women less than 15 years of age having
abortions was approximately twice that of white women in this age
group. </p>
<p>When analyzed by gestational age, approximately 99% of
abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks of gestation were
performed by curettage (Tables 19 and 20). After 12 weeks of
gestation, the most common procedure was curettage, which was
usually reported as dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Most
intrauterine instillations involved the use of saline and were
performed at greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation.
DISCUSSION </p>
<p>From 1970 to 1982, the reported number of legal abortions in
the United States increased every year (Figure 1); the largest
percentage increase occurred during the period 1970-1972. From
1976 to 1982, this annual increase declined continuously,
reaching a low of 0.2% for 1981-1982. However, since 1983, the
numbers, as well as the rates and ratios of abortion, have
remained relatively stable, with small ( less than 3%)
year-to-year fluctuations (1). </p>
<p>The abortion ratio increased each year from 1970 to 1980 and
has remained relatively stable since 1980 (Figure 2). In 1986,
the abortion ratio was 354.2 abortions/1,000 live births, and in
1987 it increased slightly to 356.1. The abortion rate also
increased each year through 1980, when it reached 25
abortions/1,000 females ages 15-44. Since that time, the rate has
remained stable, fluctuating from 23 to 24 abortions/1,000 women
ages 15-44 (Figure 3). </p>
<p>The numbers of legal abortions reported to CDC in 1986 and 1987
were probably lower than the numbers actually performed. These
numbers are based primarily on information provided by central
health agencies, whose totals are often lower than those obtained
by direct surveys of abortion providers (3). For example, in
1987, the total number of abortions reported by CDC was
approximately 13% lower than that reported by the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, a private organization that obtains information
directly from abortion providers (4). </p>
<p>In each year from 1975 through 1985, the proportion of women
obtaining an abortion in their state of residence increased from
89% in 1975 to 93% in 1983 and has remained at approximately 92%
since 1984. </p>
<p>In 1972, the women obtaining abortions were almost evenly
distributed among three age groups: less than or equal to 19
years of age; 20-24 years of age; and greater than or equal to 25
years of age. Between 1972 and 1987, the proportion of abortions
obtained by teenagers decreased steadily from 33% to 26%. Upward
shifts in the age of women in the population may account for the
continuing greater proportion, in 1986 and 1987, of abortions
obtained by women greater than or equal to 20 years of age (5,6). </p>
<p>We observed several other trends--not necessarily related to
each other--concerning the women who obtained abortions between
1972 and 1987. During the period 1972-1985, the proportion of
women obtaining abortions who were unmarried increased steadily
from 70% to 81%. In 1986, the proportion of unmarried women
decreased to 73% and further declined in 1987 to 70%. The
percentages of black women and women of other minority races
increased from 23% in 1972 to 32% in 1987, and the proportion of
women with one or no previous live births increased from 67% to
73% during the same period. The percentage distribution by
gestational age has been stable since 1977. </p>
<p>In 1986 and 1987, the trend continued for a smaller proportion
of women to obtain abortions for the first time; 87% of women in
1974 and 55% of women in 1987 had had no previous abortions.
During this 13-year period, the percentage of women who had
previously had one induced abortion increased from 11% to 25%,
the percentage of those who had had two induced abortions
increased from 1.5% to 9.6%, and the percentage of those who had
had three or more induced abortions increased from 0.4% to 4.7%.
These increases probably reflect the ongoing availability of
abortions, the increasing number of women at risk of having a
repeat abortion, and the fact that women who have had an abortion
are more likely to have another (7,8). </p>
<p>Between 1972 and 1987, the percentage of abortions performed by
curettage increased from 89% to 97%. Surveillance during the same
period showed declines in the percentages of abortions performed
by intrauterine instillation (from 10% to 1%) and by hysterectomy
and hysterotomy (from 0.6% to 0.1%). </p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1987, the percentage of second-trimester
abortions performed by D&amp;E increased from 33% to 76%, whereas the
percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by
intrauterine instillation decreased from 57% to 10%. This
increasing use of D&amp;E most likely reflects improved technology
and physicians' awareness that a lower risk of complications is
associated with D&amp;Es than with instillation procedures (9). </p>
