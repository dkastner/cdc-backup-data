</H3>
</P><P><I>This report updates, expands, and replaces the previously published CDC &quot;Guideline for Prevention of 

Nosocomial Pneumonia&quot;. The new guidelines are designed to reduce the incidence of pneumonia and other severe, acute lower respiratory tract infections in acute-care hospitals and in other health-care settings (e.g., ambulatory and long-term care institutions) and other facilities where health care is provided.
</P><P>Among the changes in the recommendations to prevent bacterial pneumonia, especially 

ventilator-associated pneumonia, are the preferential use of oro-tracheal rather than naso-tracheal tubes in patients who receive mechanically assisted ventilation, the use of noninvasive ventilation to reduce the need for and duration of endotracheal intubation, changing the breathing circuits of ventilators when they malfunction or are visibly contaminated, and (when 
feasible) the use of an endotracheal tube with a dorsal lumen to allow drainage of respiratory secretions; no 
recommendations were made about the use of sucralfate, histamine-2 receptor antagonists, or antacids for stress-bleeding prophylaxis. For prevention of health-care--associated Legionnaires disease, the changes include maintaining potable hot water 
at temperatures not suitable for amplification of 
</I><SUP></SUP>Legionella<I> spp., considering routine culturing of water samples from 
the potable water system of a facility's organ-transplant unit when it is done as part of the facility's comprehensive 

program to prevent and control health-care--associated Legionnaires disease, and initiating an investigation for the source of </I><SUP></SUP>Legionella <I>spp. when one definite or one possible case of laboratory-confirmed health-care--associated Legionnaires disease is identified in an inpatient hemopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) recipient or in two or more 
HSCT recipients who had visited an outpatient HSCT unit during all or part of the 2--10 day period before illness onset. In the section on aspergillosis, the revised recommendations include the use of a room with high-efficiency particulate air filters rather than laminar airflow as the protective environment for allogeneic HSCT recipients and the use of high-efficiency respiratory-protection devices (e.g., N95 respirators) by severely immunocompromised patients when they leave their rooms when dust-generating activities are ongoing in the facility. In the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) section, the new recommendation is to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether to administer monoclonal 
antibody (palivizumab) to certain infants and children aged &lt;24 months who were born prematurely and are at high risk for RSV infection. In the section on influenza, the new recommendations include the addition of oseltamivir 

(to amantadine and rimantadine) for prophylaxis of all patients without influenza illness and oseltamivir and zanamivir (to amantadine and rimantadine) as treatment for patients who are acutely ill with influenza in a unit where an influenza outbreak is recognized.
</P><P>In addition to the revised recommendations, the guideline contains new sections on pertussis and lower 
respiratory tract infections caused by adenovirus and human parainfluenza viruses and refers readers to the source of updated information about prevention and control of 
severe acute respiratory syndrome.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Introduction</FONT></B>
</H3>
      <P>Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with health-care--associated pneumonia, several guidelines for its prevention and control have been published. The first CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia 

was published in 1981 and addressed the main infection-control problems related to hospital-acquired pneumonia at the time: the use of large-volume nebulizers that were attached to mechanical ventilators and improper reprocessing (i.e., cleaning and disinfection or sterilization) of respiratory-care equipment. The document also covered the prevention and control of hospital-acquired influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.
</P><P>In 1994, the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) (then known as the 
Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee) revised and expanded the CDC Guideline for Prevention of Nosocomial Pneumonia to include Legionnaires disease and pulmonary aspergillosis 
(<I>1</I>). HICPAC advises the secretary of Health 
and Human Services and the directors of CDC about the prevention and control of health-care--associated infections 
and related adverse events. The 1994 guideline addressed concerns related to preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (e.g., the role of stress-ulcer prophylaxis in the causation of pneumonia and the contentious roles of selective 
gastrointestinal decontamination and periodic changes of ventilator tubings in the prevention of the infection). The report also presented major changes in the recommendations to prevent and control hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by 
<I>Legionnella </I>spp. and aspergilli.
</P><P>In recent years, demand has increased for guidance on preventing and controlling pneumonia and other lower 
respiratory tract infections in health-care settings other than the acute-care hospital, probably resulting in part from the progressive shift in the burden and focus of health care in the United States away from inpatient care in the acute-care hospital and 

towards outpatient and long-term care in other health-care settings. In response to this demand, HICPAC revised the guideline to cover these other settings. However, infection-control data about the acute-care hospital setting are more abundant and well-analyzed; in comparison, data are limited from long-term care, ambulatory, and psychiatric facilities and other health-care settings.
</P><P>This report consists of Parts II and III of a three-part document 

(<I>2</I>) and contains the consensus HICPAC recommendations for the prevention of the following infections: bacterial pneumonia, Legionnaires disease, pertussis, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV, parainfluenza and 
adenoviruses, and influenza. Part III provides suggested performance 

indicators to assist infection-control personnel in monitoring 
the implementation of the guideline recommendations in their facilities.
</P><P>Part I of the guideline provides the background for the recommendations and includes a discussion of the epidemiology, diagnosis, pathogenesis, modes of transmission, and prevention and control of the infections (<I>3</I>). Part I can be an important resource for educating health-care personnel. 
Because education of health-care personnel is the cornerstone of an 

effective infection-control program, health-care agencies should give high priority to continuing infection-control education programs for their staff members.
</P><P>HICPAC recommendations address such issues as education of health-care personnel about the prevention and control 

of health-care--associated pneumonia and other lower respiratory tract infections, surveillance and reporting of 
diagnosed cases of infections, prevention of person-to-person transmission of each disease, and reduction of host risk for infection. </P><P>Lower respiratory tract infection caused by <I>Mycobacterium 

tuberculosis</I> is not addressed in this document; however, it is covered in a separate publication (<I>3</I>).
</P><P>The document was prepared by CDC; reviewed by experts in infection control, intensive-care medicine, 
pulmonology, respiratory therapy, anesthesiology, internal medicine, and pediatrics; and approved by HICPAC. The recommendations are endorsed by the American College of Chest Physicians, American Healthcare Association, Association for Professionals 

of Infection Control and Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of 
America, and Society of Critical Care Medicine.

<B>Key Terms Used In the Guideline</B>
</H4>
      <P>Protective environment (PE) is a specialized patient-care area, usually in a hospital, with a positive air flow relative to the corridor (i.e., air flows from the room to the outside adjacent space). The combination of high-efficiency particulate 

air 

(HEPA) filtration, high numbers (<U>&gt;</U>12) of air changes per hour (ACH), and minimal leakage of air into the room creates an environment that can safely accommodate patients who have received allogeneic hemopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT). </P><P>Immunocompromised patients are those patients whose immune mechanisms are deficient because of 
immunologic disorders (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection, congenital immune deficiency syndrome, and 

chronic diseases [(diabetes mellitus, cancer, emphysema, or cardiac failure]), or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., 
radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, anti-rejection medication, and steroids). Immunocompromised patients who are identified as patients at high risk have the greatest risk for infection and include persons with severe neutropenia (i.e., an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] of <U>&lt;</U>500 cells/mL) for prolonged periods of time, recipients of allogeneic HSCT, and those who receive the 

most intensive chemotherapy (e.g., patients with childhood acute myelogenous leukemia). <H4>

        <ol>
          <li>Monitor rates of VAP; can use established benchmarks and definitions of pneumonia (e.g., NNIS definitions and 
rates) (<I>14</I>). Provide feedback to the staff about the facility's VAP rates and reminders about the need for personnel to adhere to infection-control practices that reduce the incidence 
of VAP.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Establish a SOP for influenza vaccination and monitor the percentage of eligible patients in acute-care settings or patients 
or residents in long-term--care settings who receive the vaccine. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Before and during the influenza season, monitor and record the number of eligible health-care personnel who receive 
the influenza vaccine and determine the desired unit- and facility-specific vaccination rates as recommended by ACIP.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Monitor the number of cases of health-care--associated RSV infections by geographic location within the facility and 
give prompt feedback to appropriate staff members to improve adherence to recommended 
infection-control precautions.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Periodically review clinicians' use of laboratory diagnostic tests (both culture of appropriate respiratory specimen and 

the urine antigen test) for legionellosis, especially in patients who are at high risk for acquiring the disease (e.g., patients who are immunosuppressed, including recipients of HSCT or solid-organ transplant, or patients receiving systemic steroids; 
patients aged &gt;65 years; or patients who have chronic underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, 
and COPD). Provide feedback on the use of these tests to clinicians. <br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>During construction or renovation activities in the facility, monitor personnel adherence to infection-control measures 
(e.g., use of barriers, maintenance of negative room pressure) that are aimed at minimizing dust dispersion in patient-care 

areas. Review all cases of health-care--associated aspergillosis to determine the presence of remediable environmental risks.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Periodically monitor the frequency of diagnostic testing for pertussis and the time interval between suspicion of the 
infection and initiation of isolation precautions for patients in whom pertussis is suspected.
