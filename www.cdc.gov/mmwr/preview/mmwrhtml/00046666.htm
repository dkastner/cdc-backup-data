<h1>Targeted Screening for Childhood Lead Exposure in a Low
Prevalence Area Salt Lake County, Utah, 1995 1996 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>During 1991-1994, an estimated 930,000 U.S. children aged
less than 6 years had blood lead levels (BLLs) greater than or
equal to 10 ug/dL, and the risk for an elevated BLL was greatest
among children who were non-Hispanic black or Mexican American,
from low-income families, living in large metropolitan areas, or
living in housing built before 1946 (1). Because risk for lead
exposure is associated with several different factors, it can
vary greatly across relatively small areas. To establish the
local prevalence and distribution of childhood lead exposure and
develop local blood lead screening recommendations, the Salt Lake
City-County Health Department (SLCCHD) offered free blood lead
screening to all children aged 12-36 months enrolled at the seven
Special Supple-mental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and
Children (WIC) clinics in Salt Lake County, Utah (1995
population: 812,000), during January-October 1995. This report
presents findings of the screenings at WIC clinics, describes the
design and promotion of local targeted screening recommendations,
and describes the resulting increases in appropriate BLL
screenings among children. </p>
<p>WIC Prevalence Survey </p>
<p>The seven WIC clinics are dispersed throughout Salt Lake
County. Parents or guardians for 5168 (96.6%) of 5350 children
aged 12-36 months enrolled in the WIC clinics provided written
consent for screening. Screening was done by capillary blood
sampling onto filter paper (FP), which was dried and tested for
lead with atomic absorption spectrophotometry (2). The geometric
mean BLL was 2.9 ug/dL. BLLs were greater than or equal to 10
ug/dL for 93 (1.8%) children, greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL
for 25 (0.5%), and greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL for seven
(0.1%). </p>
<p>Parents or guardians for 21 of the 25 children with
screening BLLs greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL agreed to have
confirmatory venous sampling and simultaneous repeat FP blood
sampling (performed 13-103 days after screening). Venous BLLs
ranged from 2 ug/dL to 36 ug/dL; nine were greater than or equal
to 15 ug/dL. Repeat FP BLLs ranged from 4 ug/dL to 40 ug/dL; six
were greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL. Correlation between the
simultaneously drawn FP and venous samples was high (Spearman
R=0.94), although the FP BLL averaged 1.5 ug/dL lower than the
venous BLL (range: 9 ug/dL lower to 4 ug/dL higher). </p>
<p>Twelve (66.7%) of the 18 children with screening BLLs 15-19
ug/dL and all seven children with screening BLLs greater than or
equal to 20 ug/dL resided in a small area of central Salt Lake
City (<a href="00046666.htm#00001200.gif">Figure_1</a>). Environmental assessments by the SLCCHD for
 the
seven children with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL
established the probable source of exposure for five children as
deteriorating lead-based paint in their homes; for the other two
children, no probable source of exposure was identified. </p>
<p>Design and Promotion of Screening Recommendations </p>
<p>The prevalence of BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL
among WIC screening survey participants varied from 0-6% by zip
code area among the 25 (of 34) local zip code areas from which at
least 50 children were sampled. SLCCHD used the geographic
clustering of elevated BLLs and U.S. census housing data to
design a screening &quot;target area&quot; centered around the homes of
children in the cluster and extending to adjacent areas of older
housing. The target area, bordered by major streets and natural
boundaries, included all or nearly all of five zip code areas and
smaller portions of an additional five zip code areas. It
included approximately 23 square miles (960 square city blocks),
representing approximately 10% of the inhabited land and 15% of
the population of the county (3). The target area had a much
higher prevalence of houses built before 1950 (55.4%) than the
remainder of the county (10.3%) (3). Two of the seven WIC clinics
were located within the target area. Among WIC participants aged
12-36 months screened during 1995, the prevalence of BLLs greater
than or equal to 10 ug/dL was 4.8% in the target area and 1.2%
outside the target area. </p>
<p>In October 1995, SLCCHD mailed a summary of the WIC
screening results to private physicians providing primary care to
children in the Salt Lake City area (n=327) (compiled from the
member roster of the Utah Medical Association and listings in the
local telephone book). These physicians were encouraged to begin
one-time, office-based blood lead screening as part of routine
well-child care for all children aged 6-36 months living in the
target area and to screen children living outside the target area
who were potentially at greater risk for lead exposure.
Identification of children at greater risk was based on responses
to a modified CDC questionnaire (4) that asked about residence in
a home built before 1960 that had deteriorating paint or was
being remodeled, household members with work- or hobby-related
lead exposures, elevated BLL identified in a household member,
and recent residence in the target area. In addition, all 32
pediatricians and family-practice physicians with offices in the
target area were visited by SLCCHD staff, who presented the
rationale for and the logistics of office-based screening and
described the support available from SLCCHD for screening and
follow-up of children with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL
(5,6). On completion of the physician visits in July 1996, a mass
mailing advising screening for children aged 12-36 months was
sent to all households within the 10 zip code areas that were at
least partially within the target area. </p>
<p>Targeted Screening Results </p>
<p>Information about the number of blood lead screening tests
performed and the BLLs of those screened are provided to the
SLCCHD by laboratories providing blood lead testing for Salt Lake
County. Following the promotion of the new screening
recommendations, private-sector, office-based blood lead
screening increased significantly (p less than 0.05) within both
the target area and the nontarget area. For example, during
January-March 1996, an average of 11 children (including three
children in the target area) aged 12-36 months were screened per
month, compared with 88 children (including 57 children in the
target area) per month during August-December 1996. </p>
<p>During August-December 1996, a total of 284 (approximately
7%) children in the target area were screened; 21 (7.4%) had BLLs
greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL. Among the 154 children outside
the target area also screened during this period, nine (5.8%) had
BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL. Four children in the
target area had BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL; on
environmental investigation, all elevated BLLs were determined to
be related to leaded paint in the child's home. One child not in
the target area had a BLL greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL
related to a parent's occupational exposure. </p>
<p>Reported by: TL Schlenker, MD, I Risk, MPA, H Harris, Salt Lake
City-County Health Dept, Utah. Lead Poisoning Prevention Br, Div
of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, National Center for
Environmental Health, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: Lead is an environmental toxicant with serious
adverse effects on children's behavior and development, which can
range from decreased growth, hearing, and intelligence at low
exposures to encephalopathy and death at high exposures (4). BLLs
at least as low as 10 ug/dL can adversely affect the health of
children, and the higher the BLL, the greater the risk (4). CDC
generally recommends that children first receive blood lead
screening at age 1 year but has recommended screening high-risk
children as early as age 6 months (4). To address elevated BLLs
in children, CDC guidelines recommend 1) nutritional and
educational interventions for children identified with BLLs 10-19
ug/dL, 2) environmental evaluation to identify lead hazards for
children with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL or with BLLs
that persist at greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL, and 3) medical
evaluation and intervention for children with BLLs greater than
or equal to 20 ug/dL (4). </p>
<p>National data have demonstrated consistent declines in
average BLLs in the United States for all age groups since the
late 1970s, mainly attributed to bans on the use of lead in
household paint, gasoline, food and drink cans, and plumbing
systems (1,7,8). Public health efforts to prevent childhood lead
poisoning, lead paint-abatement programs, and the promulgation of
a standard for lead exposure in industry probably also have
served to decrease lead exposure for some groups in the United
States. Nonetheless, many children in the United States continue
to be exposed to lead, primarily through house dust and soil
contaminated with lead from deteriorated lead-based paint in
older homes and residual lead fallout from vehicle exhaust (4).
Other exposure sources can include lead and lead dust brought
into the home from household members' workplaces or hobbies, lead
contained in some &quot;traditional&quot; (i.e., &quot;folk&quot;) medicines and
cosmetics, and lead that leaches into water or food from plumbing
and crystal and ceramic containers (4). </p>
<p>The findings in Salt Lake County demonstrate how evaluation
of the local distribution of childhood lead exposure risk,
targeting of services to those at greatest risk, and outreach to
the public and to health-care providers can be combined
effectively to reach children who require BLL screening. The
proportions of children identified with elevated BLLs in the
target area and outside the target area were comparable, which
may indicate that the children not in the target area were
selected appropriately for screening based on responses to the
questionnaire. </p>
<p>Venipuncture is the most accurate sampling method for BLL
testing and the only method for confirming an elevated BLL, but
fingerstick blood collected with capillary tubes is sufficiently
accurate for screening when hands are carefully cleaned to avoid
contaminating samples with lead dust on the skin surface (6). CDC
is evaluating fingerstick blood collected onto FP to determine
how accurately blood lead is measured using this method. The
overall accuracy of FP sampling in the SLCCHD study cannot be
determined because not all children received simultaneous FP and
venous BLL tests. </p>
<p>In 1991, CDC recommended universal screening of children
aged less than 6 years except in communities where the prevalence
of elevated BLLs is known to be very low (4) and therefore is not
a practical or cost-beneficial investment of limited resources.
As the prevalence of elevated BLLs continues to diminish in the
United States, targeting screening to children who remain at
elevated risk for lead exposure will become increasingly
important. The risk for childhood lead exposure can vary even
within a small geographic area, as indicated by the findings in
Salt Lake County. Therefore, CDC is developing guidelines to help
state and local health departments determine whether to recommend
universal or targeted screening within their jurisdictions and
communicate those recommendations to the public and to pediatric
health-care providers. A draft of these guidelines is available
for public review and comment until April 7, 1997; copies can be
obtained by calling (888) 232-6789 or accessing the World-Wide
Web at http://www.cdc.gov/nceh. </p>
