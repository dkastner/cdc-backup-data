<h3 align="center">Summary</H3>
<P><I>An estimated one third of the world's population is infected 
with</I> Mycobacterium tuberculosis<I>, and nearly 9 million 
persons develop disease caused by </I>M. tuberculosis 
<I>each year. Although tuberculosis (TB) occurs predominantly in resource-limited 
countries, it also occurs in the United States.
</P><P>During 1985--1992, the United States was confronted with an unprecedented TB resurgence. This resurgence was 
accompanied by a rise in multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), which is defined as TB that is resistant to the two most effective 
first-line therapeutic drugs, isoniazid and rifampin. In addition, virtually untreatable strains of 
</I>M. tuberculosis<I> are emerging globally. Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB is defined as MDR TB that also is resistant to the most effective second-line 
therapeutic drugs used commonly to treat MDR TB: fluoroquinolones and at least one of three injectable second-line drugs used to treat 
TB (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin). XDR TB has been identified in all regions of the world, including the United States.
</P><P>In the United States, the cost of hospitalization for one XDR TB patient is estimated to average $483,000, approximately 
twice the cost for MDR TB patients. Because of the limited responsiveness of XDR TB to available antibiotics, mortality rates 
among patients with XDR TB are similar to those of TB patients in the preantibiotic era.
</P><P>In January 1992, CDC convened a Federal TB Task Force to draft an action plan to improve prevention and control of 
drug-resistant TB in the United States (CDC. National action plan to combat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. MMWR 
1992;41([No. RR-11]). In November 2006, CDC reconvened the Task Force to draft an updated action plan to address the issue of MDR 
TB and XDR TB. Task Force members were divided into nine response areas and charged with articulating the most pressing 
problems, identifying barriers to improvement, and recommending specific action steps to improve prevention and control of XDR 
TB within their respective areas.
</P><P>Although the first priority of the Federal TB Task Force convened in 2006 was to delineate objectives and action steps to 
address MDR TB and XDR TB domestically, members recognized the necessity for TB experts in the United States to work with 
the international community to help strengthen TB control efforts globally. TB represents a substantial public health problem in 
low- and middle-income countries, many of which might benefit from assistance by the United States. In addition, the global 
TB epidemic directly affects the United States because the majority of all cases of TB and 80% of cases of MDR TB reported in 
the United States occur among foreign-born persons. For these reasons, the Action Plan also outlines potential steps that U.S. 
government agencies can take to help solve global XDR TB problems. Unless the fundamental causes of MDR TB and XDR TB are 
addressed in the United States and internationally, the United States is likely to experience a growing number of cases of MDR TB and 
XDR TB that will be difficult, if not impossible, to treat or prevent.
</P><P>The recommendations provided in this report include specific action steps and new activities that will require 
additional funding and a renewed commitment by government and nongovernment organizations involved in domestic and 
international TB control efforts<B> </B>to be implemented effectively. The Federal TB Task Force will coordinate activities of various federal 
agencies and partner with state and local health departments, nonprofit and TB advocacy organizations in implementing this plan 
to control and prevent XDR TB in the United States and to contribute to global efforts in the fight against this emerging 
public health crisis.

<H3 align="center"><B>Introduction</H3>
<P>Global Health Burden of Tuberculosis</B>
</p></P><P>Tuberculosis (TB) is among the most common infectious diseases and frequent causes of death worldwide 
(<I>1</I>). TB is caused by <I>Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis</I> and is spread most commonly by airborne transmission. 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> can affect any part of the body but is found most often in the lungs. Persons with pulmonary TB generally have a cough that produces small 
airborne droplet nuclei containing tubercle bacilli that can remain in the air for hours. Vulnerable persons exposed to tubercle bacilli 
in airborne droplets might become infected. The majority of persons who become infected remain noncontagious and without 
a cough or other symptoms. These persons have latent 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection (LTBI) and can be treated with a single 
drug (isoniazid) for 9 months to prevent disease.
</P><P>Infected persons who do not have underlying medical problems and do not receive LTBI treatment have a 
5%--10% lifetime risk for progressing to TB disease 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4906a1.htm">2</a></I>). However, the risk for disease progression increases substantially in the 
presence of immunosuppression, such as that caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
immunosuppressive medications (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4906a1.htm">2</a></I>). Persons with pulmonary TB can be cured with a 6-month course of antibiotics that includes 
isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol during the first 2 months. In the United States, diagnosis and treatment for TB 
is accessible and effective (<I>3</I>). However, many developing countries have limited resources to diagnose TB illness and 
treat persons with TB. Worldwide, 2 billion persons (one third of the world's population) are thought to have LTBI. Nearly 
9 million persons develop TB disease each year, and close to 2 million TB-related deaths occur annually 
(<I>1</I>). In the United States, approximately 13,000 new cases of TB are reported annually, and 650 persons die from TB each year 
(<I>4</I>). TB is the leading cause of mortality among persons infected with HIV 
(<I>5</I>).
<p>
<B>Emergence of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</B>
</p></P><P>During 1985--1992, the United States experienced an unprecedented TB resurgence marked by a substantial number 
of patients with TB who did not respond to treatment and who eventually died 
(<I>6</I>). Physicians and epidemiologists quickly determined that these persons had multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB), which is defined as TB that is resistant to 
both isoniazid and rifampin (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031159.htm">7</a></I>). Although persons with MDR TB usually can be treated effectively by relying on second-line 
drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin), these have more side effects and are more expensive and less effective than 
first-line drugs and require regimens lasting 18--24 months 
(<I>3</I>). In addition, the cure rate for persons with MDR TB is 
50%--60%, compared with 95%--97% for persons with drug-susceptible TB 
(<I>3</I>). In response to several MDR TB outbreaks in 
hospitals and correctional facilities in New York and Florida during 
1988--1991<B> </B>(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001796.htm">8</a>,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00015030.htm">9</a></I>), CDC convened a Federal TB Task Force* 
with representatives from multiple U.S. 
agencies<SUP>&#134;</SUP><B> </B>to produce recommendations for a nationwide response to the MDR 
TB outbreaks. In June 1992, the Federal TB Task Force published an action plan that provided a framework for response 
and specific action steps for state and local health departments and federal agencies 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031159.htm">7</a></I>). These action steps were grouped into 
nine categories: 1) surveillance and epidemiology, 2) laboratory diagnosis, 3) patient management, 4) screening and 
preventive therapy, 5) infection control, 6) outbreak control, 7) program evaluation, 8) information dissemination/training 
and education, and 9) research. Emergency federal funding was appropriated to CDC in 1993 and again in 1994 to allow 
the Federal TB Task Force and state and local health departments to implement certain parts of the plan. For example, 
CDC investigative teams were deployed to assist local programs in defining and organizing appropriate response to MDR 
TB outbreaks (CDC, personal communication, 2007). State and local health departments enhanced diagnostic 
laboratory capacity, increased the sensitivity of their surveillance systems, improved infection-control practices, and reemphasized 
the need for optimal treatment of all forms of TB to prevent the development and further transmission of MDR TB. 
Other federal agencies that are members of the task force also contributed substantially to implementation of the plan; a 
description of their activities follows.
</P><P>The need for increased biomedical research and product development for TB was recognized by the National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) as part of the implementation of the 1992 Action Plan. The National Institute for Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases (NIAID) established extramural and intramural research programs in all areas of fundamental, translational, 
and clinical research in TB to create a platform of knowledge and the research tools needed to study 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> and its 

interaction with the host and to characterize TB in animal models and humans. In June 2007, NIAID released a 
research agenda describing the specific biomedical research challenges and priorities that should be addressed in response to 
the emergence of drug-resistant TB (<I>10</I>).
</P><P>The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) supported studies with a strong emphasis on pulmonary 
TB, including complications through coinfection with HIV, and developed a training curriculum in TB for health professionals 
at medical institutions through the National Tuberculosis Curriculum Consortium (NTCC) 
(<I>11,12</I>). The Fogarty International Center (FIC) supported TB research and research training for developing country scientists through collaborative grants 
with U.S. institutions (<I>13</I>). The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development 
(NICHD) focused on international clinical research for optimizing TB treatment in children and women coinfected with HIV 
(<I>14</I>). The more recently created National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) has a substantial investment 
in diagnostic platform technologies (point-of-care and imaging) that can help improve TB diagnosis through advances in 
medical imaging methods (<I>15</I>).
</P><P>In May 1994, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Rifater (a fixed-dose combination of rifampin, 
isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) to facilitate patient adherence with lengthy and complex multidrug therapy 
(<I>16</I>). In addition, FDA granted a priority new drug application review for the drug rifapentine, which was approved in July 1998 for the treatment of 
TB (<I>17</I>). In 1993, the United States Marshals Service (USMS) established a formal medical program for prisoners with 
TB (USMS, personal communication, 2007). As part of this activity, USMS drafted a series of advisory memoranda to 
provide education information and guidance to USMS field offices to support TB screening for staff and prisoners. USMS 
also collaborated with the Texas Department of Health to conduct presentations on TB control in correctional 
facilities highlighting patient tracking and follow-up issues that arise when transferring prisoners between and outside 
jurisdictions. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) developed web-based information and training activities 
on acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and TB (HUD, personal communication, 2007).
</P><P>Since 1998, with the creation of specific international TB programs (e.g., directly observed treatment, short-course 
[DOTS] expansion; research; training; and TB/HIV coinfection), the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) 
has provided technical and financial support to strengthen TB control programs worldwide 
(<I>18</I>). USAID also has supported drug-resistance surveys with biannual global reports and pilot programs to optimize MDR TB treatment and the Green 
Light Committee (GLC), which helps countries gain access to high-quality second-line TB drugs so they can provide treatment 
for persons with MDR TB (<I>19</I>). More recently, the Division of Immigration Health Services (DIHS) of the Health Resources 
and Services Administration (HRSA) implemented a national TB Continuity of Care Program for persons who are detained 
by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and who are 
to be deported before completing TB therapy 
(<I>20</I>); in October 2007, DIHS was transferred from HRSA to ICE. In 
addition, U.S. government agencies have worked with their counterparts in Mexico and in U.S. state agencies to develop initiatives 
(e.g., Ten Against TB) to address TB, including drug-resistant TB, along the U.S.-Mexico border 
(<I>21</I>). During 1993--2007, as a result of implementation of the 1992 Action Plan, the reported annual incidence of MDR TB in the United States 
declined 75%, from 485 cases in 1993 to 119 cases in 2007 
(<I>4</I>).
<p>
<B>Emergence of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</B>
</p></P><P>Since 1993, both incidence of TB and the total number of TB cases in the United States have decreased, although the rate 
of decline has slowed since 2000. Worldwide, the number of TB cases has continued to increase, but the incidence rate 
has decreased since 2003. Recently, highly drug-resistant forms of TB have emerged worldwide. In 2006, CDC, the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) reported the results 
of a survey regarding drug-resistant TB conducted by 25 reference laboratories comprising the Global Supranational 
TB Reference Laboratory Network (2000--2004), the National TB Surveillance System in the United States (1993--2004), 
the national reference laboratory of South Korea (2004), and the national MDR TB patient registry in Latvia (2000--2002) 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5511a2.htm">22</a></I>). The findings indicated that 20% of 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> isolates were MDR, and 2% also were resistant to multiple 
second-line drugs. This highly resistant form of TB was identified in every region of the world, including the United States, where 4% 
of MDR TB isolates also were resistant to multiple second-line drugs. In a report published in 2006, this highly resistant form 
of TB was named<B> </B>extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR TB) 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5511a2.htm">22</a></I>). XDR TB is a subset of MDR TB that is resistant both 
to 

isoniazid and rifampin and to any fluoroquinolone drug and at least one of three second-line injectable drugs 
(amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin) (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5543a4.htm">23</a></I>).
</P><P>The emergence of XDR TB raises concerns about the possibility of epidemics of virtually untreatable TB. Such 
epidemics could result in excessive mortality and substantial financial and infrastructure burden for public health and TB 
control programs. XDR TB is much more expensive to treat, with hospitalization costs in the United States estimated to 
average $483,000 per case. A major outbreak of XDR TB in the United States would constitute a substantial drain on public 
health resources and could quickly deplete the existing state and local TB budgets and have a negative impact on progress toward 
TB elimination. This is especially true in an era of diminishing resources for TB control at the national, state, and local levels 
(<I>6</I>). Treatment failures and subsequent death are more common among patients with XDR TB, and the drugs available to 
treat XDR TB are associated with serious adverse effects. Because persons who are infected with HIV or who have other 
immune-compromising conditions (e.g., diabetes) are more vulnerable to progressing to active TB disease, infection with XDR TB is 
of particular concern among these persons. In countries with high rates of HIV and limited health-care resources, 
substantial numbers of XDR TB cases are likely present. As of April 2007, South Africa (where HIV prevalence was estimated at 
10.8% in 2005) had reported 352 cases of XDR TB, with the actual prevalence likely being much higher 
(<I>24</I>) because cultures and susceptibility testing are performed on only a small fraction of TB patients, and many drug-resistant cases will go undetected.
<p>
<B>Methodology</B>
</p></P><P>After an outbreak of XDR TB among HIV-infected persons in Kwazulu Natal, South Africa, reported in August 
2006, urgent expert consultations were organized by the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) and WHO 
in September and October 2006 (<I>25</I>). The result of these consultations was the 2007 publication of a global MDR TB and 
XDR TB response plan with eight overarching objectives 
(<I>26</I>). Several U.S. government agencies, including CDC, participated 
in the expert consultations. The U.S. Federal TB Task Force was recognized as the appropriate venue to coordinate 
U.S. involvement in the global response to XDR TB.
</P><P>In November 2006, following participation in the SAMRC and WHO XDR TB consultations, CDC convened members 
of the Federal TB Task Force to discuss the emergence of XDR TB and coordinate U.S. government agency involvement in 
the domestic and international response to this problem. After several teleconferences, the Task Force agreed that a 
U.S. government agency action plan should be written. The action plan that had been published in 1992 to respond to MDR 
TB was selected as a basis for drafting the XDR TB response plan 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031159.htm">7</a></I>). Several members of the 2006 Task Force also 
had contributed to the 1992 Action Plan to combat MDR TB. This MDR TB expertise contributed substantially to a 
well-informed and effective discussion and the creation of an Action Plan to Combat Extensively Drug-Resistant TB. As 
had occurred in the process to create the 1992 Action Plan, members of the Federal TB Task Force were divided into sections 
to address critical areas of response. The 1992 action plan distributed the objectives and implementation steps needed to 
address 38 problems among nine response areas (surveillance and epidemiology, laboratory diagnosis, patient management, 
screening and preventive therapy, infection control, outbreak control, program evaluation, information dissemination/training 
and education, and research). Although largely overlapping with the 1992 action plan, the response areas for the XDR TB 
plan were reorganized as follows: 1) diagnostic laboratory; 2) surveillance, epidemiology, and outbreak investigations; 3) 
infection control; 4) clinical and programmatic interventions; 5) ethical and legal issues; 6) communication and education; 7) 
research; 8) partnerships; and 9) cost analysis. These response areas also are closely aligned with WHO's seven-point Global Action 
Plan to Combat XDR TB (<I>26</I>), which calls for public health authorities to 1) conduct rapid surveys of XDR TB to determine 
the burden, 2) enhance laboratory capacity with an emphasis on rapid drug-sensitivity testing, 3) improve the technical 
capacity of clinical and public health practitioners to respond effectively to XDR TB outbreaks and manage patients, 4) 
implement infection-control precautions, 5) increase research support for TB drug development, 6) increase research support for 
rapid diagnostic test development, and 7) promote universal access to antiretroviral drugs under joint TB/HIV activities. 
In addition, the implementation steps were renamed &quot;action steps.&quot;
</P><P>In January 2007, each subgroup of the Federal TB Task Force that was responsible for addressing a critical response 
area began by reviewing the relevant sections of the 1992 action plan to determine which problems, 
objectives<B>,</B> and action (formerly implementation) steps needed to be deleted or updated and revised. The subgroups also determined if gaps 
existed requiring the identification of additional problems, objectives and action 
steps.<B> </B>In particular, because the 1992 plan 
had 

focused primarily on domestic MDR TB, the subgroups were instructed to expand the scope of the new plan to address 
the role of U.S. government agencies in the international response to XDR TB. To reflect this distinction, the new plan 
labels objectives as domestic, international, or both. The expanded scope and a greater emphasis on detail resulted in a 
substantial increase in the number of problems, objectives, and action steps identified compared with the 1992 plan. For example, 
the number of problems increased from 38 in 1992 to 67 in the current plan. An emphasis also was placed on being as inclusive 
as possible when designating lead federal agencies and potential external partners. To provide a basis for revisions, the 
subgroup members reviewed pertinent literature published since 1992, which is substantially more voluminous, especially for 
drug-resistant TB, compared with that available before 1992, and available unpublished data. After drafts of the sections 
were completed, the sections were compiled into a single document that was distributed to the entire Federal TB Task Force 
for review and comment. In June 2007, the Federal TB Task Force met in Rockville, Maryland, to make additional 
revisions, especially to eliminate redundancies between sections. These revisions were incorporated into a final draft that was 
submitted for multiple agency clearance in September 2007.
<H3 align="center">Recommendations to Combat Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</H3>
<P><B>Diagnostic Laboratory</B>

</P><P>The diagnosis of XDR TB is established by laboratory methods. Accurate, reliable, and prompt TB laboratory 
services should be coordinated fully with provider and public health practitioners caring for persons with TB. Test results must 
be available in a time frame that allows clinicians to make prompt and informed patient management decisions. For this goal 
to be met, laboratory capacity for the diagnosis of TB and the detection of drug resistance must be rapidly enhanced, both in 
the United States and worldwide. Adequate infrastructure must be built where it does not exist, a stable and well-trained 
work force must be developed and maintained, and a systems approach 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5406a1.htm">27</a></I>)<B> </B>must be implemented to maximize efficiency 
and proficiency. Laboratory methods and reporting, especially for susceptibility to second-line drugs, should be 
standardized through expert consensus. Rapid tests for TB diagnosis and drug-susceptibility testing on the basis of newer 
molecular methods must be evaluated promptly to determine their feasibility, especially for low-resource settings, and, if 
appropriately validated, their use should be promoted and facilitated. Internationally, competent, high-quality reference laboratory 
services with capacity to perform required testing of samples and to report results in a prompt fashion to providers and health 
officials must be available to jurisdictions in need.
<p>
<B>Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Outbreak Investigation</B>
</p></P><P>Domestic XDR TB surveillance must include accurate and complete reporting of second-line drug-susceptibility 
testing, real-time reporting, and active case finding. Central notification of MDR TB and XDR TB is essential to identify 
cross-jurisdictional issues and to provide potential for rapid emergency federal support, when needed. Internationally, rapid 
drug-susceptibility test (DST) surveys and more sustained systematic capture of DST information are highlighted as areas to 
be addressed as part of a comprehensive response to XDR TB. Epidemiologic studies that make use of genotyping tools 
are recommended to elucidate XDR TB risk factors and transmission dynamics. Strategies also are needed to rapidly identify 
and respond to domestic and international XDR TB outbreaks.
<p>
<B>Infection Control</B>
</p>
</P><P>Effective infection-control practices are critical to prevent the transmission and further spread of MDR and XDR TB 
in health-care settings and other congregate settings (e.g., correctional facilities and homeless shelters). CDC 
infection-control guidelines were updated in December 2005 and should continue to be updated as needed 
(<I><a href="rr5417a1.htm">28</a></I>). Further studies are needed to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of various infection-control strategies in different institutional settings. Testing 
workers for TB in various institutional settings is an important strategy for identifying workers infected with TB and 
detecting unsuspected transmission.
<p>
<B>Clinical and Programmatic Interventions</B>
</P>
<P>Prevention and control of TB in the United States require a robust public health infrastructure that includes a 
workforce trained in TB prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and case management. Because some patients fail to recognize TB 
symptoms, health care often is not sought during early stages of disease. In addition, providers who are unfamiliar with signs 
and symptoms of TB and with diagnostic standards might not suspect TB, delaying the start of effective treatment. Access 
to comprehensive and affordable clinical TB services (i.e., preventive, diagnostic, and treatment/case management) should 
be provided to all persons with TB or those suspected to have TB. Health-care providers who screen persons for TB should 
use up-to-date diagnostic and treatment guidelines. More health-care workers are needed to provide directly observed 
therapy (DOT) for TB patients to ensure successful treatment and help prevent development of disease attributable to 
drug-resistant TB.
<p>
<B>Ethical and Legal Issues</B>
</P>
<P>Strict infection-control measures are necessary to prevent the spread of XDR TB. Patients with XDR TB might need to 
be placed in airborne infectious isolation while initial treatment response is monitored in order to prevent disease transmission 
to others. Guidance is needed regarding the ethical and legal issues involved in identifying and treating persons with XDR 
TB. The adequacy of current public health laws in the United States to address drug-resistant TB has not been 
studied comprehensively since 1993 (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00030715.htm">29</a></I>). All states have laws to compel isolation for persons with certain infectious 
diseases (including TB); however, these laws vary by state, and those for TB might be contingent on patient nonadherence and 
failure of voluntary<B> </B>measures. Public health authorities must balance the interests of the public with individual rights. Legal 
and ethical issues become even more complicated when persons have XDR TB because prolonged isolation might be 
necessary even when a patient is adherent. In addition, for some patients, no effective treatment is available that would allow for 
release from isolation on completion. Additional complexity also exists regarding non-U.S. citizens with infectious XDR TB who 
are scheduled to be repatriated to their native countries. U.S. public health officials might not be familiar with public health 
laws of other countries.
<p>
<B>Communication and Education</B>
</P><P>As a result of TB incidence rates decreasing in the United States, health-care providers have received little training 
regarding TB and consequently might not recognize the signs and symptoms of TB, which can lead to incorrect diagnosis 
and treatment, creation of drug resistance, and continued spread of TB in the community 
(<I>30,31</I>). Health-care providers should be educated about the signs and symptoms of TB, diagnostic methods, prevention, and treatment. In addition, 
education materials on MDR TB and XDR TB should be developed for the general public, populations at high-risk for TB on the 
basis of demographic and clinical characteristics, TB patients, TB prevention advocacy organizations, and policy makers, 
including legislators. Education materials should include informational pamphlets, instructions for therapy, behaviors to 
prevent transmission, medical alerts, and descriptions of TB programs. Distribution of these materials should be coordinated 
across federal and state<B> </B>agencies and updated as necessary. Advocacy is critical to make the public aware of the importance of 
TB control to the public's health, and to educate policy makers on the magnitude of the problems that will result if resources 
to state and local TB control programs continue to decline.
<p>
<B>Research</B>
</P><P>The biomedical research challenges represented by drug-resistant TB in the context of overall TB research activities 
have been described previously (<I>10</I>).<B> 
</B>Knowledge gaps remain regarding the genetics and growth characteristics of 
<I>M. tuberculosis,</I> the physiology and biochemistry of both the host and pathogen during infection, and the disease and genotypic and 
biologic markers that facilitate surveillance and indicate infection, disease, and drug resistance. Basic research needs to be supported 
to advance understanding of these issues and to help design new approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The emergence of 
drug-resistant TB illustrates the pressing need to develop new and effective drug regimens for the treatment of TB, including 
drugs to cure MDR TB and XDR TB and to prevent development of active disease among persons who are infected latently 
with drug-resistant <I>M. tuberculosis</I>. Because poor patient adherence to therapy is one factor that can lead to development of 
MDR 

TB and XDR TB, research of associated behavioral and social factors should be conducted to identify ways to improve 
patient adherence and treatment completion. New, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic methods are needed, particularly for use 
in rural areas and developing countries. Ultimately, an effective vaccine is needed to eliminate TB.
<p>
<B>Partnerships</B>
</P><P>To coordinate efforts to control XDR TB, existing partnerships must be strengthened, and new partnerships are 
needed between countries and within both the public and private sectors, including government and nongovernment 
organizations. Partnerships are necessary to focus existing resources on the most affected geographic areas, increase current public and 
private resources (both financial and human resources), coordinate the efforts (including research, education, laboratory, 
and programmatic), and raise awareness of the problem and consequences.
<p>
<B>Cost Analysis</B>
</P><P>Comprehensive information is not available on the cost of treating and implementing programs and interventions to 
prevent XDR TB. Research on the cost of treating and preventing XDR TB is needed to calculate the cost-effectiveness and benefits 
of interventions and strategies to combat XDR TB.</P>
<H3 align="center">Action Plan to Combat Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis</H3>
<P><b>Diagnostic Laboratory</B>
</P><P>The laboratory plays a critical role in the diagnosis and management of drug-resistant TB. Test results must be available in 
a time frame that allows clinicians to make prompt patient management decisions. Many laboratory techniques used to 
confirm a TB diagnosis and to identify drug resistance were developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Substantial improvements 
have been made in culture techniques and in rapid methods in the past decade. However, these more accurate, rapid, 
and sophisticated methods have not been implemented widely, particularly in regions of the world where MDR TB and XDR 
TB are common and optimized algorithms for providing rapid point-of-care laboratory confirmation of TB and detection of 
drug resistance have not been established. To combat the growing problem of resistance to TB drugs, the most current 
methods need to be applied to their fullest capacity while better diagnostic tests are developed. The needs of the TB laboratory must 
be addressed to make laboratory services for TB, MDR TB, and XDR TB more rapid, sensitive, reliable, and more responsive 
to the needs for patient management, infection control, and TB control efforts. Although the challenges and potential 
solutions vary by setting, domestic and international TB laboratories face many of the same challenges.

<p><B>Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Outbreak Investigations</B>
</p></P><P>Identifying outbreaks of XDR TB to prevent further transmission requires a rapid, accurate, and adaptable 
surveillance system and coordinated response strategies. In the United States, individual states require reporting of TB cases by 
health-care providers and facilities to public health authorities. By mutual agreement, state health authorities report TB cases to 
CDC. Substantial delays can occur in reporting to CDC because many states report on a quarterly basis or at the end of the year. 
Key domestic surveillance needs include immediate case reporting, accurate and complete reporting of second-line 
drug susceptibility and genotyping results, and active case finding among contacts and other high risk groups. Central 
notification of MDR and XDR TB is essential to identify cross-jurisdictional issues and to outline specific areas that should be targeted 
for rapid emergency (federal) support. Improved, unambiguous technical guidance (including outcome standards) is needed 
for collection, reporting, and data-quality procedures at the local, state, and federal levels. Internationally, areas that 
require increased attention and improvement include capacity for rapid DST surveys and more sustained, systematic capture of 
DST information. Epidemiologic studies, including genetic analyses of host and pathogen, are recommended to elucidate 
risk factors for acquiring XDR TB, transmission dynamics and determinants of host survival.
<p><B>Problem 16</B>
</p></P><P>No requirement exists for rapid reporting of TB cases to the National TB Surveillance System (NTSS), and many state 
and city TB programs report to NTSS only quarterly or at the end of the year, thus substantially limiting the ability to 
identify rapidly and respond promptly to outbreaks of MDR TB and XDR TB.

to laboratories, hospitals, and other partners who might diagnose TB in patients to the state TB program and to NTSS.
</P><P>16.1.3. Develop standard reports of aggregated XDR TB case data within the NTSS to provide to local and state 
TB programs.
</P><P>16.1.4. Define mechanisms to provide feedback to state and local programs and partners regarding missing data, 
incomplete diagnostic information, and needed follow-up information.
</P><P>16.1.5. Develop procedures and data requirements that allow public health agencies to identify and address large-scale 
and interjurisdictional issues and to request rapid mobilization of a federal response in case of emergencies.
</P><P>16.1.6. Develop and maintain a national registry for MDR TB and XDR TB outside the NTSS that is linked to 
the national genotyping database or contains genotyping results from the state TB programs. The registry should include 
persons with reported cases and with nonreportable (noncounted) cases of MDR TB and XDR TB and persons with cases of 
TB identified by clinical diagnosis alone who are known contacts to culture-confirmed MDR TB or XDR TB.

<p><B>Objective 26.2</B>
</p></P><P>Provide assistance to WHO and countries outside the United States for rapid investigation of MDR TB and XDR 
TB outbreaks, including the identification of risk factors for transmission and the recommendation of responses to 
interrupt transmission and contain outbreaks (international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>

TB cases by host countries on the basis of available information.
</P><P>26.2.2. Formulate goals and objectives for the outbreak response team that are consistent with the specific request 
for assistance by the host country.
</P><P>26.2.3. Establish a rapid response team to investigate the outbreak and define procedures for communication between 
the host country's ministry of health, the CDC Director's Emergency Operation Center, DTBE, and WHO that 
include consideration for potential large-scale interjurisdictional issues that will require rapid resolution.
</P><P>Lead federal agencies: HHS (CDC) and USAID.
</P><P>Suggested collaborators: DOS, WHO, and national health ministries.
<p><B>Infection Control</B>
</p></P><P>Because TB is spread by the airborne route, anyone who breathes air containing viable tubercle bacilli is at risk for 
acquiring <I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection. This includes persons caring for and exposed to infectious TB patients, especially patients without 
an 

established diagnosis. To prevent the spread of disease and maintain the best possible care for patients, special 
infection-control practices and procedures must be available.
</P><P>Effective infection control depends on early detection and diagnosis of TB disease, prompt initiation of effective 
therapy, and airborne infection isolation to prevent further disease transmission. Each institutional setting that might house 
persons with undiagnosed TB disease or in which TB patients are treated should have infection-control programs available 
that minimize the risk for TB transmission, including MDR TB and XDR TB, to patients, workers, and others within 
the institutional setting.
</P><P>Various infection-control strategies are available depending on whether a setting will provide primary care or triage and 
refer patients with suspected or confirmed TB disease. All infection-control strategies should be on the basis of a 
three-level hierarchy: administrative controls, environmental controls, and personal respiratory protection. Combinations of 
these infection-control strategies have been demonstrated to be effective at preventing TB transmission. However, these strategies 
are not implemented consistently, and their individual effectiveness and feasibility are not well-characterized.
<p><B>Problem 27</B>
</p></P><P>Although administrative controls, environmental controls, and respiratory protection have been effective when used 
in combination, ethical issues have prevented assessment of their individual effectiveness in settings in which TB 
transmission occurs. Resulting knowledge gaps hamper efforts to prioritize interventions for optimal cost-benefit in 
resource-limited settings.
<p><B>Objective 27.1</B>
</p></P><P>Ensure dissemination and implementation of currently recommended infection-control strategies across a range of 
high-risk institutional settings (e.g., health-care facilities, substance abuse clinics, residential treatment centers, homeless shelters, 
and correctional and detention facilities) through education and regulatory programs (domestic and international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>27.1.1. Conduct a public health information campaign to encourage dissemination of recommended TB 
infection-control procedures to U.S. health-care settings (inpatient and outpatient) that provide TB care, institute measures to 
track implementation of these measures, and identify barriers to implementation.
</P><P>27.1.2. In collaboration with high-burden country health-care providers, identify and prioritize TB 
infection-control procedures appropriate for health-care settings (inpatient and outpatient) in resource-limited areas where TB care is provided.
</P><P>27.1.3. Provide regularly scheduled updates to CDC's infection-control guidelines for health-care settings and 
related documents (e.g., guidelines for correctional and detention facilities) 
(<I>26,30</I>) and provide clarification as needed.
</P><P>27.1.4. Develop guidance statements on TB prevention in HIV-infected and other immunocompromised 
health-care workers.
</P><P>27.1.5. Disseminate and implement recommendations for use of airborne infection isolation rooms for known or 
suspected TB patients and use of local exhaust ventilation for aerosol generating procedures on these patients.
</P><P>27.1.6. Disseminate and implement guidelines for selection, use, and appropriate re-use of certified respiratory 
protective devices used to protect against infection with 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> in domestic and international settings including those 
with resource constraints.
</P><P>27.1.7. Disseminate, implement, and regularly update recommendations for design, application, installation, 
monitoring, and maintenance of both upper air and in-duct ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) fixtures.
</P><P>27.1.8. Develop guidelines for effective administrative and environmental measures to prevent 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> transmission in homeless shelters, community residences for special needs populations, correctional and detention facilities, and 
substance-abuse treatment centers. Guidelines are needed for correctional and detention facilities that can be applied 
internationally; guidelines for domestic correctional and detention facilities were published in 2006 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5509a1.htm">32</a></I>) but might be relevant only to other industrialized countries with similar correctional systems and similar TB case rates.
</P><P>27.1.9. Provide technical assistance to substance-abuse centers, shelters for the homeless, community residences for 
special needs populations, correctional and detention facilities, and health-care settings to determine the adequacy of 
local administrative controls, environmental controls and respiratory protection to minimize transmission of 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I>.
</P><P>27.1.10. Regularly interact and communicate with regulatory agencies (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration [OSHA]) and standard-setting organizations (e.g., the Joint Commission [formerly the Joint Commission on Accreditation 
of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)]; the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning 
Engineers [ASHRAE]; and the American Institute of Architects [AIA]) to ensure that infection-control standards and guidelines 
for preventing <I>M. tuberculosis</I> transmission are consistent.
</P><P>Lead federal agencies: HHS (CDC, FDA, HRSA, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration [SAMHSA]), USAID, DHS (ICE), DOJ (BOP and USMS), VA, and HUD.

</p></P><P>28.1.1. Implement guidelines and requirements for improved institutional TB risk assessments in collaboration with 
OSHA and JCAHO to enhanced TB screening and monitoring procedures.
</P><P>28.1.2. Recommend considering positive tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood assay (BAMT) for identification of 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection among health-care workers as an outcome measure of the effectiveness of TB infection-control 
programs in health-care facilities that are in the medium risk category or have been classified as having potential ongoing transmission.
</P><P>28.1.3. Provide health departments with support in recruitment of and assistance to health-care centers, 
correctional facilities, homeless shelters, and substance-abuse treatment centers to implement and assess the effectiveness of programs 
for systematic TB screening of workers employed in medium- or high-risk settings.
</P><P>Lead federal agencies: HHS (CDC).
</P><P>Suggested collaborators: OSHA, JCAHO, and state and local health departments.
<p><B>Clinical and Programmatic Interventions</B>
</p></P><P>The fundamental principles and practices of TB control have been described previously 
(<I>3,33</I>). These principles and practices underlie the clinical and programmatic components of diagnosis, reporting, treatment and prevention of 
drug-resistant TB addressed in this Task Force Plan 
</P><P>Persons at risk for TB disease often fail to access health-care systems for a variety of complex reasons. A lack 
of understanding of TB and its symptoms, lack of financial resources (e.g., health insurance or transportation to the clinic), 
lack of awareness of free clinical services for TB, concerns of deportation and stigmatization, and existence of competing 
priorities (e.g., shelter and food) all contribute to delays in TB diagnosis and result in prolonged TB transmission in the 
community. Clinical and programmatic services must be integrated with and closely coordinated with TB laboratory services through 
a systems approach to ensure successful diagnosis and case management. Once patients access care, lack of familiarity with 
TB by health-care providers might result in misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment, which in turn can lead to development 
of drug resistance and continued transmission of 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I>. Once a TB diagnosis has been established, providing clinical 
TB services (preventive, diagnostic, and treatment/case-management) that are culturally acceptable, affordable and 
logistically accessible to patients is a prerequisite for successful TB management and treatment completion.
</P><P>Throughout the process of clinical care of TB patients, infection-control practices must be implemented properly, 
and health-care providers (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists, laboratorians, other allied health professionals, 
traditional healers) must be educated thoroughly and trained in all principles and practices of TB care. To sustain consistent high 
quality and prompt care of TB patients, monitoring and evaluation programs must be established to identify rapidly systems 
failures and implement corrective measures. The elements of the health system that are necessary to prevent the development 
and transmission of MDR TB and XDR TB have been identified (<a href = "rr5803a1.htm#fig">Figure</a>). Failures at any of the necessary steps related to 
proper TB diagnosis, treatment and infection-control measures can lead to the development or transmission of drug-resistant TB.
</P><P>The United States needs to assist international TB control programs in the development of clinical and 
programmatic practices that follow international standards for TB diagnosis and care, laboratory services, and infection control. 
Support should be provided to ensure that TB patients receive services free of charge and have access to DOT through the 
completion of treatment. The implementation of international information sharing mechanisms is critical for the prevention of 
drug resistance and the successful control of TB worldwide.
<p><B>Problem 29</B>
</p></P><P>TB patients might not have access to care.

<p><B>Communication and Education</B>
</p></P><P>Comprehensive and tailored information on TB and drug-resistant TB including XDR is needed for many 
different audiences. In the United States, private health-care providers (i.e., those not in public health departments) receive 
little education or training on detection and appropriate treatment of TB 
(<I>11,30,31,36--38</I>). As a consequence, infectious TB 
often goes unrecognized, even if a patient presents to a physician with apparent signs and symptoms of active disease. This has led 
to incorrect treatment, prolonged transmission of TB in the community, and creation of drug-resistant organisms.
</P><P>Education and communication must be appropriately targeted to health-care providers and patients to improve 
awareness and guide access to competent clinical services. Community leaders and health policy makers, including public health 
officials, must be well informed about the need to communicate and address issues that can fuel the development and spread of 
drug-resistant TB in their communities. Education efforts should clearly outline the critical elements that must be applied 
to prevent and control TB in various settings and risk populations 
(<I>34</I>).
</P><P>Clear, concise messages, easy to understand yet comprehensive education materials and medical alerts should be 
developed and disseminated to the general public, TB patients, physicians and other health-care workers, health advocacy 
organizations, and decision makers, including legislators. These communications should be coordinated across Federal agencies and 
updated as necessary. Increasing awareness of the signs and symptoms of TB and the appropriate treatment and control strategies, 
must become a priority in the United States to ensure TB is recognized and treated as a public health threat with the potential 
to result in virtually untreatable forms of disease, such as XDR TB.
</P><P>In TB-endemic countries where cases of drug-resistant TB are increasing, health authorities must also remain 
informed about the risk for and incidence of XDR TB. There, provider education initiatives must also focus on the need for 
appropriate case management, including knowledge regarding locally and regionally available specialty resources and medications and 
the consequences of inappropriate or inadequate treatment of drug-resistant TB.
<p><B>Problem 44</B>
</p></P><P>Health-care providers and the general public are not well-informed about the symptoms, appropriate, diagnosis, 
treatment, and prevention of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB including XDR TB.
<p><B>Objective 44.1</B>
</p></P><P>Develop education mechanisms and materials, targeted to public and private health-care providers and other workers

the importance of detecting and treating LTBI and TB disease and the importance of prompt reporting of TB cases to 
proper health authorities.
</P><P>44.1.4. Communicate to health-care providers the importance of consulting and engaging TB experts in the 
medical management of MDR TB patients to avoid the development of XDR TB and to ensure that appropriate specialized

clinicians, non-U.S. health-care providers, university health service, occupational medicine specialists, rheumatologists, 
oncologists, radiologists, laboratories, traditional healers, NGOs, and CBOs.
</P><P>44.1.10. Present specialty-specific information about care and control of all forms of TB at professional conferences.

<p><B>Research</B>
</p></P><P>Biomedical research in TB creates a foundation of knowledge that informs the development of new health-care 
interventions as well as control and prevention strategies for drug-resistant TB. While U.S. federal agencies have substantially contributed 
to research in TB and the identification of drugs, vaccines and diagnostics, the emergence of more difficult to treat forms 
of drug-resistant TB will require renewed and more targeted efforts to help control and prevent the development 
and transmission of drug-resistant forms of TB. One compilation of biomedical research priorities related to MDR TB and 
XDR TB has been published (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00031159.htm">7</a></I>).
</P><P>TB therapy was revolutionized in the 1940s by the development of antibiotics by academic and for-profit organizations, 
and the demonstration of their efficacy and safety in randomized clinical trials largely conducted by the public sector. 
These therapies became the basis for the global DOTS strategy for TB control. Although initially highly effective in reducing 
the incidence and prevalence of TB in endemic countries, the continued success of the DOTS strategy is now seriously 
threatened by the emergence of highly drug-resistant strains of 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I>. Furthermore, interactions between TB and 
HIV medications and drugs used in the treatment of specialized problems such as diabetes, drug addiction and mental 
disorders (conditions that are encountered in populations at risk for TB) might substantially complicate the development of 
effective new TB drugs. To ensure the continued availability of effective therapeutics against all forms of TB, the development of 
new, safe, and effective TB drugs must remain a high priority. Success in TB drug development will also heavily rely on 
the establishment and continued support of competent, experienced trial sites in TB and TB/HIV endemic countries for all 
phases of clinical testing.
<p><B>Problem 45</B>

<p><B>Fundamental Science</B>
</p></P><P>The foundation for development of new health-care interventions in TB is a solid understanding of the interaction 
between <I>M. tuberculosis</I> and the host and how infection transitions to active disease. Knowledge acquired through basic research 
in these areas must be effectively leveraged in translational science (i.e., research that translates basic scientific discoveries 
into clinical applications). As a consequence of the sequencing of the genome of both the host and pathogen, the development 
of molecular tools to manipulate the pathogen, the establishment of genomic and 
postgenomic<B> </B>technologies and tools, and the expansion of animal models available to study TB, many important questions in the pathogenicity of TB now can 
be addressed.
</P><P>Although considerable progress in fundamental science (basic and translational) of TB has been made over the past 
decade, the availability of more tools, technologies and advanced methodologies has made it possible to create new hypotheses 
and revisit earlier observations to contribute to a more detailed understanding of the best points of intervention in TB 
treatment, necessary characteristics of potential new TB vaccines, and what host/pathogen factors might be early indicators of 
infection, disease, drug resistance, and transmission. In addition, the effectiveness of current and new infection-control measures, such 
as negative pressure, high-efficiency particulate air filters, laminar flow, ventilation design on the basis of modeling 
approaches (e.g., computational fluid dynamics, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, room air cleaners, and alternative air 
disinfection methodologies) should be evaluated in appropriate research settings.

<p><B>Diagnostics</B>
</p></P><P>The prompt and correct diagnosis of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB is one of the cornerstones of effective 
TB control. Current diagnosis of pulmonary TB in endemic countries is limited to clinical evaluation combined with 
low sensitivity microbiologic tests. Available diagnostics do not offer the speed and sophistication needed to provide physicians 
in the field in high-burden countries with the information required to accurately diagnose drug- susceptible and 
drug-resistant 

TB and to prescribe the most appropriate treatment regimens. Three distinct research and development areas need to 
be addressed:
</P><UL>
<LI>microbiological diagnostics: rapid identification of drug-resistance or drug-sensitive TB and levels/types of drug resistance;
<LI>clinical diagnostics: rapid identification of pulmonary and nonpulmonary TB, accurate diagnosis of TB in HIV 
infected patients, reliable identification of latent 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection and accurate exclusion of TB disease; and
<LI>response to treatment: follow-up of patients on empiric therapy when drug resistance testing was not possible/feasible 
(e.g., extrapulmonary TB).
</UL>
 </P><P>Although certain diagnostics platforms might be technologically too advanced for field use in resource limited 
countries, these tests might nevertheless provide a substantial contribution to the advancement of new therapeutics for TB by 
allowing rapid assessment of response to therapy in clinical trials. Such measures are critical in settings with patients 
with extrapulmonary TB and those where drug-susceptibility testing is not possible or delayed. Furthermore, rapid assessment 
of response to therapy will help determine whether adequate regimens have been prescribed and might contribute to limiting 
the development of drug resistance.
<p><B>Problem 54</B>
</p></P><P>Rapid, point-of-care identification of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB among 
HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults and pediatric populations ands reliable early identification of latent 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> infection are not yet possible (see Problem 15).
<p><B>Objective 54.1</B>
</p></P><P>Develop rapid, point-of-care diagnostics for the reliable identification of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant pulmonary 
and extrapulmonary TB disease and latent infection including in HIV infected patients and pediatric populations (domestic 
and international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>54.1.1. Provide increased support for basic research on the biology of

<p><B>Problem 55</B>
</p></P><P>Efforts to develop tests to rapidly characterize clinical response to new and improved drug regimens in clinical trials 
are limited.
<p><B>Objective 55.1</B>
</p></P><P>Develop serologic, immunologic, and microbiologic tests to assess response to treatment. Evaluate technologically 
advanced tests, which might or might not be feasible to implement in endemic countries, for measuring drug efficacy in clinical trials 
of new therapeutics and regimens for TB (domestic and international).

TRC-Chennai).
<p><B>Vaccines</B>
</p></P><P>Long-term control and ultimate elimination of TB likely will require an effective vaccine 
(<I>40</I>). Research to characterize needs for an effective vaccine, on the basis of immunological responses of persons infected with 
<I>M. tuberculosis</I> who do not become ill<B> 
</B>and animal models and comparisons with the currently used vaccine 
<I>M. bovis</I> Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) have been supported for over a decade. BCG vaccine, usually administered once in infancy in countries with a moderate and 
high incidence of TB, is effective in preventing TB meningitis and disseminated TB in children but has highly variable efficacy 
in preventing other forms of TB, especially in adults 
(<I>41</I>). Strategic plans for a TB vaccine have been developed, and support 
for biomedical research for the development of new, more effective vaccines and vaccinations strategies has resulted in progress 
to the point where several new vaccine candidates are now being evaluated in clinical trials. Nevertheless, a highly 
effective vaccine has remained elusive.
</P><P>Increased capacity to allow entry of novel vaccine candidates into Phase I clinical studies and comparative studies of 
vaccine platforms in human trials will contribute substantially to understanding development needs for effective TB 
vaccines. However, assays and methodologies for preclinical validation and clinical characterization need to be standardized 
globally. Clinical trial protocols for the assessment of vaccination strategies and the development of expertise to conduct clinical 
trials and immunological assays in TB endemic countries are needed to establish a robust infrastructure for TB vaccine research 
and development (R&amp;D).
<p><B>Problem 56</B>
</p></P><P>Current preclinical and clinical efforts in TB vaccine development are not optimally coordinated.
<p><B>Objective 56.1</B>
</p></P><P>Facilitate and expedite the identification and clinical testing of new vaccine candidates and vaccination strategies 
(domestic and international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>56.1.1. Discuss the role of U.S. government partners in contributing to global TB vaccine R&amp;D and identify areas 
of contribution.
</P><P>56.1.2. Contribute to and assist in the global coordination of TB vaccine development and clinical testing.
</P><P>56.1.3. Encourage and support clinical studies to assess the potential role of BCG vaccination in MDR TB and XDR 
TB outbreaks where no effective antibiotics are available to contribute to control strategies.
</P><P>56.1.4. Encourage and support studies with subunit, peptide, vectored and DNA vaccines as adjuncts to therapy for 
MDR TB and XDR TB.
</P><P>56.1.5. Establish collaborations with regulatory agencies worldwide to discuss harmonization of regulatory pathways 
for clinical development and approval of new drugs, vaccines and diagnostics for TB.
</P><P>56.1.6. Encourage and support research on postexposure vaccination.
</P><P>56.1.7. Continue to support resources and facilities for testing of new TB vaccines in animal models.

and TRC-Chennai).
<p><B>Behavioral, Social, Clinical, and Operational Science</B>
</p></P><P>Current TB therapy is complex and lengthy, and it can be associated with adverse reactions to medications. 
Patient adherence often is difficult, leading to discontinuation of therapy; this results in relapse, continued transmission of 
disease, and, in some cases, the development of drug-resistant TB. Adherence is influenced by patient characteristics, differences 
in health-care seeking behavior, assumptions about disease, the health-care environment, the availability of 
adherence-enhancing interventions, the quality of communication between patients and providers, the availability and use of education materials 
to inform patients and families about TB, treatment and consequences of defaulting, the convenience of access to drugs 
for supervised treatment, and the quality of drugs available through TB control programs.
</P><P>The complexity of factors underlying patient adherence and the importance of completing treatment for TB 
necessitates increased emphasis on patient-centered treatment options and a thorough understanding of behavioral and 
social interventions that have to be in place to augment traditional TB control approaches. Operational research to improve 
care programs must include studies to characterize TB health services, case and data management practices, staff selection, 
training 

and retention incentives, physician training, management and organizational structure, relationships with the 
community, community perceptions of services, community resistance to public health services, and clinic policies and practices to 
provide the best possible environment for ensuring patient trust and treatment completion.
<p><B>Problem 57</B>
</p></P><P>Patient adherence to TB chemotherapy is not optimal, and alternative methods for ensuring completion of therapy are 
not fully developed.
<p><B>Objective 57.1</B>
</p></P><P>Identify alternatives and adjuncts to currently used treatment protocols through behavioral research to improve adherence 
to therapy (domestic and international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>57.1.1. Encourage and support studies to develop and validate predictor instruments to identify patient, social and 
cultural factors associated with poor adherence to therapy and development of drug-resistant TB.
</P><P>57.1.2. Continue to support research on cultural influences on health-care utilization and adherence among 
foreign-born persons and minority groups at risk for drug-resistant TB.
</P><P>57.1.3. Encourage and support studies to determine the effectiveness of interventions to increase adherence, 
including incentives, supports (enablers), and provision of social and other health-care services offered through TB programs.
</P><P>57.1.4. Support studies to evaluate the contribution of communication styles of TB health-care providers to 
treatment outcomes.
</P><P>57.1.5. Facilitate surveys of TB treatment practices of various health-care providers to determine discrepancies in 
practices that might contribute to poor adherence and development of drug-resistant TB.
</P><P>57.1.6. Support studies to identify barriers to effective communication and implementation of effective practices 
by providers most likely to treat patients at risk for drug-resistant TB.
</P><P>57.1.7. Support review of prior formative communications research and conduct new studies to identify innovative 
and effective education methods to reach populations with high disease prevalence.
</P><P>57.1.8. Evaluate education strategies for targeting the health-care providers of patients at risk for drug-resistant TB 
and identify shortcomings and barriers to communication.
</P><P>Lead federal agencies: HHS (CDC, FDA, and NIH).

<p><B>Problem 58</B>
</p></P><P>Operational and clinical questions related to patient adherence and optimal organization and structure of health services 
to ensure effective TB care remain unanswered.
<p><B>Objective 58.1</B>
</p></P><P>Identify operational, clinical and systems barriers to providing effective TB care and develop strategies for 
improvement (domestic and international).

</P><P>Suggested collaborators: WHO, other national research agencies (e.g., BMRC, SAMRC, and TRC-Chennai), and academia.
<p><B>Partnerships</B>
</p></P><P>Because XDR TB presents a worldwide threat, a coordinated international response will rely on effective 
partnerships between all organizations and governments that are involved in TB control programs, TB biomedical research and 
product development (<a href = "rr5803a1.htm#box">Box</a>. In addition, the establishment of new alliances is needed to fill the critical gaps in the global 
response identified in this report. Currently, government agencies at all levels, international organizations, 
nongovernment organizations (NGOs), academic institutions, and the private sector are coordinating their efforts as members of the STOP 
TB Partnership. Furthermore, cross-disciplinary research and product development efforts are brought together through 
various nonprofit organizations focused on developing affordable and effective drugs, vaccines and diagnostics. Representatives 
from United States government agencies are actively involved in these partnerships and contribute their knowledge and expertise 
to help address the national and global aspects of XDR TB.
</P><P>The U.S. Federal Tuberculosis Task Force serves as a mechanism to coordinate activities of various federal agencies that 
are involved in domestic and international TB prevention and elimination programs. Domestically, U.S. government 
agencies work closely with local and state TB control programs, academic institutions, professional associations, and 
pharmaceutical companies to assure the most effective use of available resources and to minimize duplication of effort. The expansion 
of existing partnerships to include management and prevention of XDR TB and other forms of drug-resistant TB will 
be important if TB is to be eliminated in the United States and worldwide.
<p><B>Problem 59</B>
</p></P><P>Differing jurisdictions among public health agencies, scopes of work among nongovernment organizations, and 
varying country-specific public health policies, economic conditions, and political commitments pose a substantial barrier 
to launching and focusing a coordinated response to TB (MDR TB and XDR TB and HIV/TB) in high-burden settings with 
the greatest needs.
<p><B>Objective 59.1</B>
</p></P><P>Optimize integration, coordination and synergy between U.S. government agencies, international organizations, 
and national TB/HIV programs to achieve reduction in disease rates through more focused prevention/intervention activities 
for MDR TB and XDR TB and HIV/TB and nonduplicative allocation of funding, staff and resources (international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>59.1.1. Develop programs or working groups to maximize cooperation between international organizations and to 
align resources for an efficient, resource sparing response in high-burden countries.
</P><P>59.1.2. Establish additional interagency agreements to formalize existing cooperative efforts, where feasible.

<p><B>Problem 60</B>
</p></P><P>Currently available global funds are insufficient to mount a comprehensive response to XDR TB, particularly in 
settings with high rates of HIV/TB co-infection. Resources need to be focused on this emerging threat, on the basis of identification 
of specific needs.
<p><B>Objective 60.1</B>
</p></P><P>Educate global and domestic partners on the international problem of TB, what activities are ongoing and what gaps 
remain to provide an effective response to MDR TB, XDR TB, and HIV/TB (domestic and international).
<p><B>Action Steps</B>
</p></P><P>60.1.1. Increase interactions within existing partnerships and with private sector organizations, companies, and 
foundations to increase awareness of the current gaps that affect a global response to TB.

<p><B>Problem 61</B>
</p></P><P>Globally, human resources at all levels in national TB programs are insufficient and maintaining a well qualified 
workforce has been difficult due to the continuous exodus of qualified, experienced TB and/or HIV staff. Domestically, the number 
of medical professionals with experience in managing TB patients, much less MDR TB and XDR TB patients, has declined 
in parallel with TB cases. A critical need is to strengthen human resources at the local and state/provincial/district level.
<p><B>Objective 61.1</B>

<p><B>Problem 64 </B>
</p></P><P>Outside of the public health community, only limited awareness exists of the potential consequences of XDR TB for

<p><B>Problem 65</B>
</p></P><P>Current public health partnerships are not sufficient to ensure continuity of care for TB patients and their contacts 
who either reside temporarily in the United States or frequently cross its borders. More than half the TB cases in the United 
States occur among immigrants who become infected before their arrival in the United States. Lack of continuity of care 
contributes to treatment default, ongoing transmission, and prolonged illness. Partnerships are needed for effective transnational 
case management.

<p><B>Cost Analysis</B>
</p></P><P>A realistic national estimate of the costs of diagnosing, treating, and managing XDR TB will be an important 
prerequisite for measuring the benefit and savings to the United States that would be realized through prevention of XDR TB. CDC 
has estimated the costs for hospitalization of one XDR TB patient at approximately $483,000 (CDC, unpublished data 
2007) whereas outpatient treatment costs, productivity losses, patient out-of-pocket expenses, and quality of life changes 
attributable to XDR TB are unknown.
</P><P>Some of the existing interventions and strategies for TB care and management, such as the use of DOT, already have 
been demonstrated to be cost effective in preventing the development of MDR TB, but information about additional strategies 
is currently not available. Analysis of such cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness data will be critical to prioritize programs 
and advocate for resources to implement specific interventions to help prevent XDR TB.

<H3 align="center">Conclusion</H3>
<P>The nine response areas addressed in this report are closely aligned with WHO's seven-point Global Action Plan to 
Combat XDR TB (<I>26</I>), which calls for public health authorities to 1) conduct rapid surveys of XDR TB to determine the burden, 
2) enhance laboratory capacity with an emphasis on rapid drug sensitivity testing, 3) improve technical capacity of clinical 
and public health practitioners to respond effectively to XDR TB outbreaks and manage patients, 4) implement 
infection-control precautions, 5) increase research support for TB drug development, 6) increase research support for rapid diagnostic 
test development, and 7) promote universal access to antiretroviral drugs under joint TB/HIV activities. 
</P><P>The Federal TB Task Force Plan and the Global Action Plan will require a renewed commitment by all public 
health workers as well as new resources from both the public and private sectors. In the United States, federal funding has 
remained relatively level since 2000, and state and local funding has declined in many states since 2000. As a result, TB prevention 
and control capacity in the United States has eroded. For example, many states have decided to implement selective rather 
than universal patient-centered DOT to ensure adherence to treatment until complete. These decisions are made on the basis 
of financial constraints but place the patient at high risk for treatment failure and subsequently the potential creation of 
MDR TB or XDR TB. In the absence of shorter treatment regimens, and without adherence-promoting measures such as DOT, 
the TB patient is more likely to experience drug resistance that could result from interruptions in treatment. These choices 
place the public and the nation in a vulnerable position, risking outbreaks of MDR or XDR TB if conditions facilitate rapid 
spread and possibly causing public health crises. 
(<I>42,43</I>)
</P><P>The Federal TB Task Force Plan provides an effective framework to detect, prevent, and control XDR TB, but it 
also highlights the existence of substantial unmet needs. There is concern that progress in TB prevention and control is waning 
as manifested by the decrease in the rate of decline in TB incidence since 2000. The United States responded successfully to 
the MDR TB problem in the 1990s and is capable of preventing and controlling XDR TB; however, this will require a 
united commitment and effort similar to that which occurred in 1992.
