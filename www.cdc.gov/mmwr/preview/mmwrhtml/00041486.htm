National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention </p>
<p>and Health Promotion </p>
<p>Abstract </p>
<p>Problem/Condition: From 1980 through 1992, the number of legal
 induced
abortions reported to CDC remained stable, varying each year by
 less than
or equal to 5%. </p>
<p>Reporting Period Covered: This report summarizes and reviews
 information
reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the
 United
States during 1992. This report also includes recently reported
abortion-related deaths for 1988-1990 and an update on
 abortion-related
deaths for 1985-1987. </p>
<p>Description of System: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled
 abortion
data received from 52 reporting areas (i.e., the 50 states, the
 District of
Columbia, and New York City). </p>
<p>Results: In 1992, 1,359,145 abortions were reported -- a 2.1%
 decrease from
1991. The abortion ratio was 335 legal induced abortions per 1,000
 live
births, and the abortion rate was 23 per 1,000 women 15-44 years of
 age.
Women who were undergoing an abortion were more likely to be young,
 white,
and unmarried; most had had no previous live births and were
 obtaining an
abortion for the first time. More than half (51%) of all abortions
 were
performed at or before the 8th week of gestation, and 87% were
 before the
13th week. Approximately 14% of abortions were performed at less
 than or
equal to 6 weeks of gestation, 15% were performed at 7 weeks of
 gestation,
and 22% at 8 weeks of gestation. Younger women (i.e., women less
 than or
equal to 19 years of age) were more likely to obtain abortions
 later in
pregnancy than were older women. Sixteen deaths in 1988, 12 deaths
 in 1989,
and five deaths in 1990 were associated with legal induced
 abortion. The
case-fatality rates for 1988, 1989, and 1990, respectively, were
 1.2, 0.9,
and 0.3 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced
 abortions. </p>
<p>Interpretation: Since 1980, the number and rate of abortions have
 remained
relatively stable, with only small year-to-year fluctuations of
 less than
or equal to 5%. However, since 1987, the abortion-to-live-birth
 ratio has
declined; in 1992, the abortion ratio was the lowest recorded since
 1977.
More pregnant women have been opting to carry their pregnancies to
 term
rather than choosing to have an abortion. As in previous years,
 deaths
associated with legal induced abortions occurred rarely (i.e., one
 or fewer
deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions). </p>
<p>Actions Taken: The number and characteristics of women who obtain
 abortions
in the United States should continue to be monitored so that
 efforts to
prevent unintended pregnancy can be assessed and the preventable
 causes of
morbidity and mortality associated with abortions can be identified
 and
reduced. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the number
 and
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions, to
 monitor
unintended pregnancy, and to assist with efforts to identify and
 reduce
preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with
 abortions.
This report is primarily based on surveillance data for 1992
 provided to
the Division of Reproductive Health in CDC's National Center for
 Chronic
Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. </p>
<p>METHODS </p>
<p>For 1992, CDC compiled data from 52 reporting areas: the 50
 states, the
District of Columbia, and New York City. The total number of legal
 induced
abortions was available from all reporting areas; however, not all
 these
areas collected information on the characteristics of women who
 obtained
abortions. Characteristics by age of women who obtained an abortion
 were
available for only 41 states, the District of Columbia, and New
 York City
(which together comprised 62% of abortions reported for 1992); and
characteristics by race were available for only 34 states, the
 District of
Columbia, and New York City (51% of abortions). For 47 reporting
 areas,
data were provided from the central health agency; * for the other
 five
areas, data were provided from hospitals and other medical
 facilities.
Because information regarding residence was unavailable for the
 majority of
women who obtained abortions, the procedures were reported by the
 state in
which they were performed. </p>
<p>Women who obtained legal induced abortions were grouped by
 5-year age
groups. Both ratios (i.e., the number of abortions per 1,000 live
 births
per year) and rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women per
 year) are
presented by age group. Ratios were calculated by using the number
 of live
births provided by each state's central health agency (except where
 noted),
and rates were calculated by using the number of women reported in
 special
unpublished tabulations provided by the Bureau of the Census.
 Because
almost all (94%) abortions among women less than 15 years of age
 occur
among those 13-14 years of age (1), the number of women ages 13-14
 years
was used as the denominator for calculating abortion rates for the
 less
than 15-years' age group. Rates for women greater than or equal to
 40 years
of age were based on the number of women ages 40-44 years. </p>
<p>Race was categorized by either three groups (i.e., a} white
 {which
included Hispanics}, b} black, and c} all other races) or two
 groups (a}
white {which included Hispanics} and b} black and all other races).
 Other
races included Asian/Pacific Islander, Native American, Alaskan
 Native, and
women classified as &quot;other race.&quot; In 1990, data regarding Hispanic
ethnicity were first available on abortion reports submitted to CDC
 by
central health agencies. In this report for 1992, as in the report
 for
1991, Hispanic ethnicity was reported separately from race. </p>
<p>In 1992, for the first time, most areas reported week of
 gestation at
the time of abortion for abortions that occurred at less than or
 equal to 8
weeks of gestation. Most areas reported gestational age (in weeks)
 at the
time of abortion from estimates derived from the time elapsed since
 the
woman's last menstrual period. In eight states, gestational age was

reported on the basis of the physician's estimate, which could have

included information from the clinical examination as well as the
 time
elapsed since the last menstrual period. </p>
<p>CDC has periodically reported data on abortion-related deaths
 since
1972. Sources for obtaining such data include national and state
 vital
records, maternal mortality review committees, surveys, private
 citizens,
the media, health-care providers, and medical examiner reports.
 Clinical
records and autopsy reports are requested and reviewed by medical
epidemiologists to determine the cause of death and to verify that
 the
death was abortion-related. </p>
<p>An abortion-related death was defined as a death resulting from
 a) a
direct complication of an abortion, b) an indirect complication
 caused by
the chain of events initiated by the abortion, or c) aggravation of
 a
preexisting condition by the physiologic or psychologic effects of
 the
abortion. Each death was then further categorized either as a) not
abortion-related or b) legal induced, illegal induced, spontaneous,
 or
unknown depending on the type of abortion. </p>
<p>Abortion-related deaths that occurred during 1988-1990 are
 included in
this report. Also included are trends in case-fatality rates for
 legal
induced abortion for 1972-1990 and updated totals for 1985-1987
 that
include abortion-related deaths not previously reported to CDC (2).
 </p>
<p>RESULTS </p>
<p>For 1992, 1,359,145 legal abortions were reported to CDC,
 representing
a 2.1% decrease from the number reported for 1991 (3)
 (<a href="00041486.htm#00001642.htm">Table_1</a>). From
1970 through 1982, the reported number of legal abortions in the
 United
States increased every year (<a href="00041486.htm#00000867.gif">Figure_1</a>); the largest percentage
 increase
occurred from 1970 to 1972. From 1976 through 1982, the annual
 increase
declined continuously and reached a low of 0.2% for 1980-1981. From
 1980
through 1990, the number of abortions increased steadily; however,
year-to-year fluctuations were less than or equal to 5%. Since
 1990, the
annual number of abortions has decreased slightly each year. </p>
<p>The national abortion ratio increased from 1970 to 1980, peaked
 at 364
per 1,000 live births in 1984, and began to decline steadily after
 1987 to
335 per 1,000 in 1992 (<a href="00041486.htm#00000867.gif">Figure_1</a>; <a href="00041486.htm#00001643.htm">Table_2</a>). The national
 abortion
rate increased from 17 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 years
 in 1974
to 25 per 1,000 in 1980 and has since remained at a rate of 23-24
 per
1,000. </p>
<p>In 1992, as in previous years, most abortions were performed in

California, Florida, New York City, and Texas; the fewest were
 performed in
Idaho, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming (3,4) (<a href="00041486.htm#00001644.htm">Table_3</a>).
 For
women whose state of residence was known, approximately 92% had
 obtained
the abortion within their own state. The percentage of abortions
 obtained
by out-of-state residents ranged from approximately 53% in the
 District of
Columbia to less than 1% in Hawaii. Ten reporting areas could not
 provide
data concerning abortions obtained by out-of-state residents. </p>
<p>In 1992, 41 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City

reported legal abortions by age. Women ages 20-24 years obtained
 34% of all
abortions; women ages less than 15 years obtained less than 1% of
 all
abortions (<a href="00041486.htm#00001645.htm">Table_4</a>). Abortion ratios were highest for the
 youngest
women (790 abortions per 1,000 live births for women ages less than
 15
years and 440 per 1,000 for women ages 15-19 years) and the oldest
 women
(454 per 1,000 for women ages greater than or equal to 40 years);
 the ratio
was lowest for women ages 30-34 years (183 per 1,000 women)
 (<a href="00041486.htm#00000868.gif">Figure_2</a>).
Among teenagers, the abortion ratio was highest for those who were
 less
than 15 years of age and lowest for those who were 19 years of age
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001646.htm">Table_5</a>). In contrast, abortion rates were highest for women
 ages
20-24 years (42 abortions per 1,000 women) and lowest for women at
 the
reproductive-age extremes (three abortions per 1,000 women ages
 less than
15 years and two abortions per 1,000 women ages greater than or
 equal to 40
years) (<a href="00041486.htm#00001645.htm">Table_4</a>). </p>
<p>For most age groups, the abortion ratio rose between 1974 and
 the early
to mid-1980s and declined thereafter, particularly for the youngest
 and
oldest women of reproductive age (<a href="00041486.htm#00000869.gif">Figure_3</a>). The abortion ratio
 for
women less than 15 years of age remains higher than ratios for the
 other
age groups. The abortion ratio for women 15-19 years of age had
 decreased
for 5 consecutive years when, in 1992, the lowest abortion ratio
 for that
age group was reported. The abortion ratio for women 20-34 years of
 age
(i.e., the group with the highest fertility rate) has remained
 stable since
the mid-1980s (5). </p>
<p>Thirty-seven states, the District of Columbia, and New York
 City
reported the gestational age (in weeks) for women who obtained a
 legal
abortion (<a href="00041486.htm#00001647.htm">Table_6A</a>). Of these reporting areas, 35 states and
 New York
City included the gestational age in weeks for abortions performed
 at less
than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation (<a href="00041486.htm#00001648.htm">Table_6B</a>). During 1992,
approximately 51% of reported legal abortions were obtained at less
 than or
equal to 8 weeks of gestation, and about 87% were obtained at less
 than 13
weeks (<a href="00041486.htm#00001647.htm">Table_6A</a>). Approximately 14% of abortions were performed
 during
the earliest weeks of gestation (i.e., at less than or equal to 6
 weeks),
and approximately 15% and 22% were performed at 7 weeks and 8 weeks
 of
gestation, respectively (<a href="00041486.htm#00001648.htm">Table_6B</a>). Few abortions were provided
 after
15 weeks of gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were
 obtained at
16-20 weeks of gestation, and 1.5% were obtained at greater than or
 equal
to 21 weeks (<a href="00041486.htm#00000870.gif">Figure_4</a>). </p>
<p>Approximately 98% of legal abortions were performed by
 curettage, and
less than 1% by intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001649.htm">Table_7</a>). Hysterectomy and hysterotomy were used in only a few
 cases;
less than 0.006% of abortions were performed by using these
 methods. </p>
<p>Thirty-four states, the District of Columbia, and New York City

reported the race of women who obtained legal abortions. As in
 previous
years, almost two thirds of women who obtained abortions were white
 (3,4)
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001650.htm">Table_8</a>). The abortion ratio for black women (518 per 1,000
 live
births), however, was more than twice that for white women (236 per
 1,000
live births). The abortion ratio for women of other races (352 per
 1,000
live births) was approximately 1.5 times greater than that for
 white women.
In addition, the abortion rate for black women (41 per 1,000 black
 women)
was 2.7 times greater than the rate for white women (15 per 1,000
 white
women). </p>
<p>Twenty states, the District of Columbia, and New York City
 reported
data on legal abortions classified by Hispanic ethnicity
 (<a href="00041486.htm#00001651.htm">Table_9</a>). The
percentage of abortions obtained by Hispanic women in these
 reporting areas
ranged from less than 1% in several states to approximately 39% in
 New
Mexico. For Hispanic women in these reporting areas, the abortion
 ratio was
307 per 1,000 live births -- slightly lower than the ratio for
non-Hispanics in the same areas (326 per 1,000 live births).
 However, the
abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women (32 per 1,000 women) was
 greater
than the rate per 1,000 non-Hispanic women (21 per 1,000 women). </p>
<p>Seventy-six percent of women who obtained abortions were
 unmarried
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001652.htm">Table_10</a>). The percentage varied by state, from 59% in Utah to
 85% in
Mississippi and Wisconsin. The abortion ratio was more than nine
 times
greater for unmarried women than for married women (790 vs. 84
 abortions
per 1,000 live births). </p>
<p>Approximately 46% of women who obtained legal abortions had had
 no
previous live births, and about 89% had had two or fewer previous
 live
births (<a href="00041486.htm#00001653.htm">Table_11</a>). The abortion ratio was highest for women who
 had had
no live births and lowest for women who had had one live birth. </p>
<p>About 54% of the women were obtaining an abortion for the first
 time.
Approximately 17% of the women had had at least two previous
 abortions
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001654.htm">Table_12</a>). </p>
<p>The age distribution of women who obtained a legal abortion
 differed
only slightly by race (<a href="00041486.htm#00001655.htm">Table_13</a>). However, the percentage of
 women who
were black or of other races and who were less than 15 years of age
 at the
time they obtained an abortion, although small (1.2%), was twice
 the
percentage of white women less than 15 years of age (0.6%). The
 percentage
of unmarried women who were black or of other races (82%) was also
 slightly
higher than the percentage who were white (77%). Few differences
 were found
by age and Hispanic ethnicity (<a href="00041486.htm#00001656.htm">Table_14</a>), but among married
 women who
had obtained an abortion, a slightly higher percentage were
 Hispanic than
non-Hispanic. </p>
<p>Most (87%) women obtained an abortion during the first 12 weeks
 of
pregnancy; however, teenagers (i.e., women ages less than or equal
 to 19
years) were more likely than older women to obtain abortions later
 in
pregnancy (<a href="00041486.htm#00001657.htm">Table_15A</a> and <a href="00041486.htm#00001658.htm">Table_15B</a>). The percentage of
 women who
obtained an abortion early in pregnancy (i.e., at less than or
 equal to 8
weeks of gestation) increased with age, and the percentage who
 obtained an
abortion late in pregnancy (at greater than or equal to 16 weeks of

gestation) decreased with age (<a href="00041486.htm#00000871.gif">Figure_5</a>). Women who were black
 or of
other races were more likely to obtain an abortion later in
 pregnancy than
were white women (<a href="00041486.htm#00001657.htm">Table_15A</a>). Although Hispanic women were
 slightly
more likely than non-Hispanic women to have had an abortion at less
 than or
equal to 8 weeks of gestation, the overall differences between
 Hispanic and
non-Hispanic women in the timing of abortions were minimal. </p>
<p>More than 99% of abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks of

gestation were performed by curettage (primarily suction
 procedures)
(<a href="00041486.htm#00001659.htm">Table_16</a>). After 12 weeks of gestation, the most frequently
 used
procedure was also curettage, although it was usually reported as
dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Approximately half of the
 intrauterine
instillations involved the use of saline and were performed at
 greater than
or equal to 16 weeks of gestation. </p>
<p>Thirty-one possible abortion-related deaths were reported to
 CDC for
1988. Twenty-four of these deaths were categorized as having an
abortion-related cause (i.e., 16 deaths were associated with legal
 induced
abortions, and eight deaths with spontaneous abortion)
 (<a href="00041486.htm#00001660.htm">Table_17</a>). The
remaining seven deaths were classified as not abortion-related.
Twenty-seven possible abortion-related deaths were reported to CDC
 for
1989. Of these deaths, 17 were associated with abortion-related
 causes
(i.e., 12 deaths were associated with legal induced abortion, one
 with
illegal induced abortion, and four with spontaneous abortion). Ten
 deaths
were classified as not abortion-related. A total of 18 possible
abortion-related deaths were reported to CDC for 1990. Ten of these
 deaths
resulted from abortion-related causes (i.e., five deaths were
 associated
with legal induced abortion and five with spontaneous abortion).
 The
remaining eight deaths were classified as not abortion-related.
 Possible
abortion-related deaths for 1991 through 1993 are being
 investigated and
have not yet been categorized. </p>
<p>The updated total numbers of abortion-related deaths for 1985,
 1986,
and 1987 include one additional death per year that had not been
 reported
previously to CDC (<a href="00041486.htm#00001660.htm">Table_17</a>). Thus, the total number of legal
abortion-related deaths per year for 1985 and 1986 increased from
 10 to 11,
and for 1987 the total increased from six to seven. The
 case-fatality rate
for both 1985 and 1986 remained at 0.8, whereas for 1987 it
 increased from
0.4 to 0.5 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions. In 1987,
 four deaths
that were classified originally as being related to spontaneous
 abortions
were reclassified after further investigation as not being
abortion-related. Since 1980, the case-fatality rate for deaths
 associated
with legal induced abortions has remained at less than or equal to
 one
death per 100,000 legal induced abortions (<a href="00041486.htm#00000872.gif">Figure_6</a>). </p>
<p>DISCUSSION </p>
<p>When compared with the numbers reported for previous years, the
 number
of abortions performed each year since 1980 in the United States
 has
remained relatively stable. However, the number has been decreasing
 since
1990 (i.e., the year in which the number of abortions was highest)
 (4). </p>
<p>In 1992, the national abortion-to-live-birth ratio was the
 lowest
recorded since 1977. The abortion ratio increased steadily from
 1970
through 1980, decreased slightly during 1981-1983, increased to its
 highest
level in 1984, remained fairly stable until 1987, and then began to
 decline
(<a href="00041486.htm#00000867.gif">Figure_1</a>). More pregnant women were opting to carry their
 pregnancies
to term rather than have an abortion. Other factors that could have

contributed to this effect included reduced access to abortion
 services,
changes in contraceptive practices, attitudinal changes concerning
 abortion
and/or carrying unplanned pregnancies to term, and the possibility
 that the
number of unintended pregnancies have decreased (6-8). </p>
<p>In other countries, the annual rate for legal abortions per
 1,000 women
of reproductive age has ranged from greater than 100 in the former
 Soviet
Union to five in the Netherlands (9). The induced abortion rate in
 the
United States for 1992 was higher than that reported by Australia,
 Canada,
and Western European countries, and lower than that reported by
 China,
Cuba, the Eastern European countries, and the Newly Independent
 States of
the former Soviet Union (9). Abortion rates for teenagers were
 higher in
the United States than in most Western European countries and some
 Eastern
European countries (9). </p>
<p>As in previous years, the abortion ratio in 1992 varied
 substantially
by age (3,4). Although the ratio was highest for teenagers, the
 percentage
of legal abortions obtained by women less than or equal to 19 years
 of age
has decreased steadily since the mid-1980s -- from 26% in 1984 to
 22% in
1990 and to 20% in 1992 (4,10). Since 1980, the abortion ratio
 declined for
most age groups -- particularly for women less than or equal to 19
 years of
age and greater than or equal to 40 years of age. In 1992, the
 abortion
ratio for teenagers 15-19 years of age was the lowest ratio CDC had
 ever
recorded for that age group. Variations in rates of childbearing
 among
teenagers may have accounted for some of the decline in abortion
 ratios for
these women (5), as well as changing access to abortion services
 (7),
recent changes in abortion laws (e.g., parental consent or
 notification
laws and mandatory waiting periods) -- all of which are likely to
disproportionately affect adolescents (11,12). </p>
<p>During 1992, the abortion ratio for black women was more than
 twice
that for white women, and the abortion rate for black women was
 about three
times that for white women. Race-specific differences in abortion
 ratios
and rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic
 status,
contraceptive use, and access to family planning, contraceptive,
 and
abortion services. </p>
<p>The abortion-to-live-birth ratio for Hispanic women during 1992
 was
slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic women. Other published
 reports
indicate that pregnant Hispanic women are less likely than pregnant

non-Hispanic women to obtain an abortion (13). The abortion rate
 per 1,000
Hispanic women was higher than that for non-Hispanic women. Other
 studies
using previously published data also reported higher abortion rates
 for
Hispanic women than for non-Hispanic women (13). For women in all
 age
groups, fertility was higher for Hispanic than for non-Hispanic
 women (5).
However, in 1992, as in 1991, only 20 states, the District of
 Columbia, and
New York City reported the number and percentage of abortions by
 Hispanic
ethnicity; these geographic areas represented approximately 43% of
 all
Hispanic women of reproductive age in the United States for that
 year (CDC,
unpublished data). Thus, the number, ratio, and rate of abortions
 for
Hispanic women reported in this surveillance summary might not be
representative of the overall Hispanic population in the United
 States
(i.e., these data might reflect utilization of abortion services
 only in
these states). </p>
<p>The percentage distribution of abortions by gestational age was
 stable
from 1980 through 1992 (<a href="00041486.htm#00001642.htm">Table_1</a>). For the first time since CDC
 began
abortion surveillance, data concerning week of gestation for
 abortions
obtained at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation were
 available.
These data will assist researchers in monitoring trends in legal
 abortions
as new medical methods of terminating pregnancy are developed;
 these new
methods will be used primarily to terminate pregnancies at less
 than or
equal to 8 weeks of gestation (14-16). </p>
<p>In this and previous reports, age was inversely associated with
 timing
of abortion. Younger women (i.e., women greater than or equal to 19
 years
of age) were more likely to obtain an abortion later in gestation
 than were
older women (3,17,18). </p>
<p>The percentage of women who were obtaining an abortion for the
 first
time decreased from 75% in 1974 to 54% in 1992 (<a href="00041486.htm#00001654.htm">Table_12</a>) (19).
 During
this period, the percentage of women who were obtaining an abortion
 and who
previously had had one induced abortion increased from 10% in 1974
 to 25%
in 1985 and to 27% in 1992 (10). The percentage who had had two
 previous
abortions increased from approximately 1% in 1974 to approximately
 10% in
1985; from 1985 through 1992, the percentage remained at
 approximately
9%-11%. The percentage who had had three or more abortions
 increased from
0.4% in 1974 to approximately 5% in 1985; from 1990 through 1992,
 this
percentage remained at 6%. Because the percentage of all legal
 induced
abortions that are repeat procedures increases with the abortion
 rate, the
percentage of repeat procedures increased during the 1970s and
 early 1980s
as the abortion rate rose; since then, the abortion rate and the
 proportion
of abortions that are repeat procedures have stabilized (20,21). </p>
<p>From 1972 to 1992, the percentage of abortions performed by
 curettage
(which includes D&amp;E) increased from 89% to 99% (<a href="00041486.htm#00001642.htm">Table_1</a>), and
 the
percentage of abortions performed by intrauterine instillation and
 by
hysterectomy and hysterotomy declined substantially (from 10.4% to
 0.7% and
from 0.6% to 0.01%, respectively). From 1974 through 1992, the
 percentage
of second-trimester abortions performed by D&amp;E increased from 31%
 to 90%;
the percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by
 intrauterine
instillation decreased from 57% to 3% (19). The increasing use of
 D&amp;E might
have resulted from the lower risk for complications associated with
 the
procedure (22,23). </p>
<p>From 1972 (when CDC's surveillance of abortion mortality began)
 through
1990, the annual number of reported deaths associated with legal
 induced
abortion decreased 79% (24). In 1972, 63 reported deaths were
 attributed to
complications of induced abortion. Of these deaths, 24 (38%) were
associated with legal induced abortion and 39 (62%) with illegal
 induced
abortion. In 1990, five deaths attributed to legal induced abortion
 were
reported. The case-fatality rate decreased approximately 93%
 between 1972
(4.1 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions) and 1990 (0.3
 deaths per
100,000 legal induced abortions) (<a href="00041486.htm#00000872.gif">Figure_6</a>). These
 case-fatality rates
have remained at one or fewer deaths per 100,000 legal induced
 abortions
since 1980, indicating that a woman's risk for death from having
 had a
legal induced abortion continues to be extremely low (25-27). </p>
<p>The numbers, ratios, and rates of abortion from this analysis
 are
conservative estimates because the number of legal abortions
 reported to
CDC for 1992 was probably lower than the number actually performed.
 Totals
provided by central health agencies are often lower than those
 obtained by
direct surveys of abortion providers (24). For example, the total
 number of
abortions reported to CDC for 1992 was approximately 11% lower than
 that
reported to The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI), a private
 organization
that directly contacts abortion providers to obtain information on
 the
number of abortions performed (<a href="00041486.htm#00000873.gif">Figure_7</a>) (8). However, since
 1987, the
percentage difference in the number of abortions reported to AGI
 compared
with the number reported to CDC has decreased. In addition,
 information
regarding personal characteristics (e.g., gestational age and the
 woman's
age and race) was not available from all states; therefore, the
 numbers,
percentages, ratios, and rates derived from this analysis may not
 be
representative of all women who obtained abortions during 1992. </p>
<p>Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national
 surveillance
of legal induced abortion are used for several purposes. First,
 data from
abortion surveillance are used to identify characteristics of women
 at high
risk for unintended pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance
 is
essential to monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of
 abortions in
the United States. Third, statistics on the number of pregnancies
 ending in
abortion are used in conjunction with birth statistics to estimate
pregnancy rates (e.g., pregnancy rates among teenagers) (28,29) and
 other
outcome rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic pregnancies per 1,000
pregnancies). Fourth, abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to
 evaluate
the effectiveness of family planning services and programs for
 preventing
unintended pregnancy. Fifth, ongoing surveillance provides data for

assessing changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion
 (e.g.,
changes in the types of procedures used). Finally, these data are
 used as
the denominator in calculating abortion morbidity and mortality
 rates. </p>
<p>Induced abortions are linked usually to unintended pregnancies,
 which
often occur despite use of contraception (13,30,31). In the late
 1980s,
about 1.2 million live births occurred for which the pregnancy was
unintended (i.e., either mistimed or unwanted at conception) (32).
 Improved
contraceptive practices, as well as access to and education
 regarding safe,
effective, and low-cost contraception and family planning services,
 can
help minimize the frequency of abortion in the United States (33). </p>
<p>Not all states have acknowledged the need for state-based
 surveillance
of induced abortion, and some states that have recognized the need
 have
been unable to gather such information. Moreover, many states
 emphasize the
prevention of unintended pregnancy, particularly among teenagers.
 To help
guide this effort, however, an ongoing, accurate assessment of
 induced
abortion is needed to determine the number and characteristics of
 women who
obtain these procedures. </p>
<p>Additional statistical and epidemiologic information about
 legal
induced abortions is available from CDC's automated Reproductive
 Health
Information System (telephone {404} 330-1230), which provides
 information
by fax, voice recordings, or mail. </p>
