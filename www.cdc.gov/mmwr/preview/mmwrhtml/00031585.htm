<p>Merrell Ramick
Division of Reproductive Health, National Center for Chronic
 Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion </p>
<p>Abstract </p>
<p>Condition: Since 1980, the number of legal induced abortions
 reported to
CDC has remained fairly stable, varying each year by less than or
 equal to
5%. </p>
<p>Reporting Period Covered: This report summarizes and reviews data
 received
by CDC for legal induced abortions obtained in 1990. </p>
<p>Description of System: For each year, CDC compiles abortion data
 received
from 52 reporting areas: 50 states, New York City, and the District
 of
Columbia. </p>
<p>Results: In 1990, 1,429,577 abortions were reported -- a 2.4%
 increase from
1989. The abortion ratio for 1990 was 345 legal induced abortions
 per 1,000
live births, and the abortion rate was 24 per 1,000 women ages
 15-44 years.
Most women undergoing abortions were young, white, and unmarried;
 most had
had no previous live births and were having the procedure for the
 first
time. Approximately half of all abortions were performed before the
 8th
week of gestation, and 87% were before the 13th week of gestation.
 Younger
women were more likely to obtain abortions later in pregnancy than
 were
older women. </p>
<p>Interpretation: Since 1980, the national number (and rate) of
 abortions has
remained relatively stable, with only small (less than or equal to
 5%)
year-to-year fluctuations. However, since 1984, the national
 abortion ratio
has declined; in 1990, the abortion ratio was the lowest recorded
 since
1977. Increasing rates of childbearing may account for some of this

decline. </p>
<p>Actions Taken: The number and characteristics of women having
 abortions are
needed from all states to furnish an accurate characterization of
 legal
induced abortion in the United States and to assist efforts to
 identify and
reduce preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated
 with
abortions. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the
 number and
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions and to
 assist
efforts to identify and reduce preventable causes of morbidity and
mortality associated with abortions. This report, as in previous
 years, is
based on abortion data provided to the Division of Reproductive
 Health
(DRH), National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
 Promotion,
CDC. </p>
<p>METHODS </p>
<p>For 1990, DRH compiled data received from 52 reporting areas:
 50
states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. The total
 number of
legal induced abortions was available from all reporting areas,
 most of
which provided information about the characteristics of women
 obtaining
abortions. For 46 reporting areas, data were provided from the
 central
health agency *; for the remaining six reporting areas, data were
 provided
from hospitals and other medical facilities. Data were reported by
 the
state in which the abortion occurred. </p>
<p>Ages of women obtaining legal induced abortions were grouped
 by 5-year
intervals. For the first time in this report, both ratios (the
 number of
abortions per 1,000 live births) and rates (the number of abortions
 per
1,000 women) are presented by age group. Ratios were calculated by
 using
the number of live births provided by each state's central health
 agency
(except where noted), and rates were calculated by using the number
 of
women recorded in unpublished tabulations provided by the U.S.
 Bureau of
the Census. Rates for women less than 15 years of age were based on
 those
for women ages 10-14 years, and rates for women greater than or
 equal to 40
years of age were based on those for women ages 40-44 years. </p>
<p>Race was categorized either into three groups (white {which
 includes
Hispanics}, black, and all other races) or into two groups (white
 {which
includes Hispanics} and black and other races). For the first time
 in this
yearly report, data on ethnicity are included -- both the number
 and the
abortion ratio for women of Hispanic origin are presented. Because
 of data
collection methods for 1990 abortions, Hispanic origin was not
 reported
separately by race. Race-specific estimates for the number of
 abortions and
for abortion ratios were determined by assuming that Hispanic women
 were
white, since 97% of Hispanic women who had a live birth in 1990
 were white
(1). In some states with relatively large Hispanic populations, the

abortion ratio for white women may reflect to a considerable degree

abortions among Hispanic women. Such data analyzed by race may be
 helpful
for public health officials who are responsible for family planning
 and
health education programs. </p>
<p>Abortion statistics for 1990 and selected previous years were
 compared
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000547.htm">Table_1</a>). The percentage distributions are based on data from
 all
areas reporting a given characteristic. In contrast to other tables
 in this
report, the summary table excludes all unknown values unless
 otherwise
noted. Abortion ratios and rates are presented by year
 (<a href="00031585.htm#00000548.htm">Table_2</a>).
State-specific characteristics of women obtaining abortions in 1990
 are
presented (Tables 3-12), and overall tabulations of selected
 character-
istics are given (Tables 13-15). </p>
<p>RESULTS </p>
<p>In 1990, 1,429,577 legal abortions were reported to CDC -- a
 2.4%
increase over the number reported for 1989 (2) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000547.htm">Table_1</a>). The
 national
abortion rate increased from 23 abortions per 1,000 women ages
 15-44 years
in 1986 to 24 per 1,000 in 1987 and has since remained at that rate

(<a href="00031585.htm#00000548.htm">Table_2</a> and <a href="00031585.htm#00000275.gif">Figure_1</a>). The national abortion ratio rose
 slightly,
from 354 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1986 to 356 per 1,000
 in 1987,
and has declined since then to 345 per 1,000 in 1990. </p>
<p>In 1990, as in previous years, the most abortions were
 performed in
California, New York City, and Texas; the fewest were performed in
 Wyoming,
South Dakota, Idaho, and Alaska (2,3) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000549.htm">Table_3</a>). For women
 whose state
of residence was known, approximately 92% had the abortion
 performed in
their own state of residence. The percentage of abortions obtained
 by
out-of-state residents ranged from approximately 53% in the
 District of
Columbia to less than 1% in Hawaii. Eleven reporting areas in 1990
 did not
have data available for abortions obtained by out-of-state
 residents. </p>
<p>In 1990, 40 states, the District of Columbia, and New York
 City
reported legal abortions by age. Women 20-24 years of age obtained
 approx-
imately 33% of all abortions; women less than 15 years of age
 obtained
about 1% (<a href="00031585.htm#00000550.htm">Table_4</a>). Abortion ratios were highest for the
 youngest women
(844 abortions per 1,000 live births for women less than 15 years
 of age
and 515 per 1,000 live births for women 15-19 years of age) and the
 oldest
women (501 per 1,000 live births for women greater than or equal to
 40
years of age); the ratio was lowest for women 30-34 years of age
 (191 per
1,000 live births) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000276.gif">Figure_2</a>). Among teenagers, the abortion
 ratio was
highest for those less than 15 years of age and lowest for those 19
 years
of age (<a href="00031585.htm#00000551.htm">Table_5</a>). Abortion rates were highest among women 20-24
 years
of age (43 abortions per 1,000 women 20-24 years of age) and lowest
 among
women at the age extremes (one abortion per 1,000 women less than
 15 years
of age and three abortions per 1,000 women greater than or equal to
 40
years of age) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000550.htm">Table_4</a>). </p>
<p>For most age groups, the abortion ratio rose from 1974 through
 the
early 1980s and declined thereafter, particularly for the youngest
 and
oldest women (i.e., women less than 15 years of age and greater
 than or
equal to 40 years of age) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000277.gif">Figure_3</a>). The abortion ratios for
 women
less than 15 years of age and 15-19 years of age were higher than
 those for
the other age groups. However, 1990 marked the third year in a row
 for a
downward trend among the youngest women. In 1990, the ratio for
 women less
than 15 years of age was the lowest recorded for the time period,
 and the
ratio for women 15-19 years of age was the lowest recorded since
 1974. The
abortion ratio for women 20-34 years of age (the group with the
 highest
fertility rate) has fluctuated little since 1974 (4). </p>
<p>In 1990, approximately 51% of reported legal abortions were
 performed
before 8 weeks of gestation, and about 87% were done before 13
 weeks
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000552.htm">Table_6</a>). Approximately 4% of the abortions were performed at
 16-20
weeks of gestation, and 1% were performed at greater than or equal
 to 21
weeks. </p>
<p>Approximately 97% of legal abortions were performed by
 curettage, and
less than 1% by intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000553.htm">Table_7</a>). Hysterectomy and hysterotomy were rarely used; less
 than
0.02% of abortions were performed by these methods. </p>
<p>In 1990, 30 states, the District of Columbia, and New York
 City
reported legal abortions by race. As noted in previous reports,
 almost two
thirds of women obtaining abortions were white (2,3) (<a href="00031585.htm#00000554.htm">Table_8</a>).
 The
abortion ratio for black women, however, was about twice that for
 white
women (521 vs. 258 per 1,000 live births). The abortion ratio for
 women of
other minority races was approximately 1.3 times higher (335 per
 1,000 live
births) than that for white women. </p>
<p>In 1990, for the first time, 22 states and New York City
 reported
legal abortions by Hispanic origin (<a href="00031585.htm#00000555.htm">Table_9</a>). The percentage of

Hispanic women obtaining abortions in these reporting areas ranged
 from
less than 1% in several states to almost 40% in New Mexico. The
 abortion
ratio for Hispanic women from these reporting areas was 258 per
 1,000 live
births. When abortion ratios for Hispanic and non-Hispanic white
 women from
the same reporting areas were compared (data not shown), the ratio
 for
Hispanic women was lower (258 per 1,000 live births vs. 267 per
 1,000).
This pattern was consistent among four of the five areas reporting
 the
largest numbers of Hispanic women obtaining abortions (data not
 shown). </p>
<p>In 1990, approximately 76% of women obtaining abortions were
 unmarried
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000556.htm">Table_10</a>). This percentage varied by state, from about 62% in
 Utah to
almost 85% in Wisconsin. The abortion ratio was approximately 10
 times
higher for unmarried women than for married women: 879 vs. 89
 abortions per
1,000 live births. </p>
<p>Approximately 48% of the women obtaining legal abortions had
 had no
previous live births, and about 89% had had two or fewer previous
 live
births (<a href="00031585.htm#00000557.htm">Table_11</a>). The abortion ratio was highest for women who
 had had
no live births and lowest for women who had had one live birth. </p>
<p>Approximately 56% of women obtaining abortions were having the

procedure for the first time, and approximately 16% had had at
 least two
previous abortions (<a href="00031585.htm#00000558.htm">Table_12</a>). </p>
<p>When the age distribution of women undergoing legal abortion
 was
analyzed by race, few differences were found between white women
 and
minority women (<a href="00031585.htm#00000559.htm">Table_13</a>). However, the percentage of minority
 women
less than 15 years of age who obtained an abortion, although small
 (1.3%),
was more than twice that of white women in this age group. When the

percentage of women obtaining a legal abortion was analyzed by race
 and
marital status, a slightly higher proportion of unmarried minority
 women
was noted (80.7% of women of black and other races vs. 76.2% of
 white
women). </p>
<p>Overall, most women obtained abortions during the first 12
 weeks of
pregnancy. However, women less than 15 years of age were more
 likely than
older women to obtain abortions later in pregnancy (<a href="00031585.htm#00000560.htm">Table_14</a>).
 The
percentage of women obtaining an early abortion (less than or equal
 to 8
weeks of gestation) increased with age, and the percentage
 obtaining a late
abortion (greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation) decreased
 with
age (<a href="00031585.htm#00000278.gif">Figure_4</a>). Women of black and other races tended to obtain

abortions later in pregnancy than did white women (<a href="00031585.htm#00000560.htm">Table_14</a>). </p>
<p>More than 99% of abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks
 of
gestation were performed by curettage (primarily suction
 procedures)
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000561.htm">Table_15</a>). For abortions performed later than 12 weeks of
 gestation,
curettage was also the most common procedure, although it was
 usually
reported as dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E) (not shown). Most
 intrauterine
instillations involved the use of saline and were usually performed
 at 16
weeks of gestation or later. </p>
<p>DISCUSSION </p>
<p>From 1970 through 1982, the reported number of legal abortions
 in the
United States increased every year (<a href="00031585.htm#00000275.gif">Figure_1</a>); the largest
 percentage
increase occurred during 1970-1972. From 1976 through 1982, this
 annual
increase steadily declined, reaching a low of 0.2% for 1980-1981.
 Since
1980, the number of abortions has remained relatively stable, with
 only
small (less than or equal to 5%) year-to-year fluctuations. </p>
<p>The abortion ratio increased steadily from 1970 through 1980,
decreased slightly from 1981 through 1983, increased to its highest
 level
in 1984, and then began to decline (<a href="00031585.htm#00000275.gif">Figure_1</a>). In 1990, the
 national
abortion ratio was the lowest recorded since 1977. Increased birth
 rates
for women of all ages may have contributed to this decline (1). The

national abortion rate increased each year through 1980, when it
 reached 25
abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 years. Since that time, the
 rate has
remained stable, fluctuating from 23 to 24 abortions per 1,000
 women ages
15-44 years (<a href="00031585.htm#00000275.gif">Figure_1</a>). </p>
<p>In other countries, legal abortion rates range from a high of
 more
than 100 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age (15-44
 years) in the
former Soviet Union to a low of 5 per 1,000 in the Netherlands (5).
 The
induced abortion rate in the United States is higher than those
 reported by
Australia, Canada, and Western European countries and lower than
 those
reported by the former Soviet Union, China, Cuba, and Eastern
 European
countries (5). Abortion rates for teenagers are higher in the
 United States
than in most Western European countries and in some Eastern
 European
countries (5). </p>
<p>Abortion ratios vary widely by age. Although the abortion
 ratio was
highest for teenagers, the percentage of legal abortions they
 obtained has
steadily decreased since the mid-1980s -- from 26% of all legal
 induced
abortions in 1984 to 24% in 1989 and to 22% in 1990 (2). Since
 1980, the
abortion ratio has declined for most age groups, particularly for
 the
youngest and oldest women. Increasing rates of childbearing among
 teenagers
and women greater than or equal to 35 years old may account for
 some of the
decline in abortion ratios in these age groups (1). </p>
<p>In 1990, the abortion ratio for black women continued to be
 about
twice that for white women. Differences in abortion ratios by race
 may
reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status,
 educational
level, access to family planning and contraceptive services, and
 contra-
ceptive use. </p>
<p>In 1990, the abortion ratio for Hispanic women was lower than
 for non-
Hispanic white women. At all ages, Hispanic women have higher
 fertility
than do non-Hispanic women (1). In contrast to our findings, other
 studies
based on earlier data suggest that abortion rates for Hispanic
 women were
higher than for non-Hispanic women (6). </p>
<p>Several other trends -- not necessarily related to each other
 -- were
observed for women who obtained abortions from 1972 through 1990
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000547.htm">Table_1</a>). During that time, the percentage of women obtaining
 an
abortion in their state of residence increased from 56% to 92% and
 has
remained stable at approximately 91%-92% since 1984. From 1972
 through
1990, the percentage of women obtaining abortions who were
 unmarried
increased steadily, from 70% to almost 80% in 1984; since then, the

percentage has remained about 78%-81% (2). The number of women
 having
abortions who had had one or no previous live births increased from
 68% in
1972 to 73% in 1977 and has remained at 74%-78% since that time. </p>
<p>The percent distribution of abortions by gestational age has
 been
relatively stable since 1978, although some changes have occurred
 in the
percentage of women obtaining legal abortions either early (less
 than or
equal to 8 weeks) or late (greater than or equal to 16 weeks) in
 gestation
(<a href="00031585.htm#00000547.htm">Table_1</a>). Previous reports have found, as did this study, that
 age is
inversely correlated with the timing of abortion (i.e., younger
 women were
more likely to obtain abortions later in gestation than were older
 women)
(2,7,8). </p>
<p>The percentage of women having abortions who did so for the
 first time
decreased from 75% in 1974 to 56% in 1990 (<a href="00031585.htm#00000558.htm">Table_12</a>) (9).
 During this
15-year period, the percentage of women who had previously had one
 induced
abortion increased from 10% in 1974 to 26% in 1988 and remained at
 that
level in 1990. The percentage who had had two previous abortions
 increased
from about 1% in 1974 to approximately 10% in 1985 and has remained
 at
about 9%-10% since that time. The percentage who had had three or
 more
abortions increased from 0.4% in 1974 to approximately 5% in 1985
 and to 6%
in 1990. These increases in the early to mid-1980s probably
 reflected the
increasing number of women at risk of having had an abortion and
 the
greater likelihood that women who have had one abortion are more
 likely to
have another abortion when compared with women who have never had
 one
(10,11). </p>
<p>During the period 1972-1990, the percentage of abortions
 performed by
curettage increased from 89% to 99% (<a href="00031585.htm#00000547.htm">Table_1</a>). Surveillance
 during the
same period showed a sharp decline in the percentage of abortions
 performed
by intrauterine instillation (from 10% to 1%) and by hysterectomy
 and
hysterotomy (from 0.6% to 0.02%). </p>
<p>From 1974 through 1990, the percentage of second-trimester
 abortions
performed by D&amp;E increased from 31% to 93%; the percentage of
 second-
trimester abortions performed by intrauterine instillation
 decreased from
57% to 5% (9). The increasing use of D&amp;E may have resulted from the

improved technology and the lower risk of complications associated
 with the
procedure (12,13). </p>
<p>The number of legal abortions reported to CDC in 1990 was
 probably
lower than the number actually performed. Totals provided by
 central health
agencies are often lower than those obtained by direct surveys of
 abortion
providers (14). For example, the total number of abortions reported
 by CDC
for 1988 was approximately 16% lower than that reported for the
 same year
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private organization that
 directly
contacts abortion providers to obtain information on the number of
abortions performed ** (15). </p>
<p>Despite these limitations, ongoing national surveillance of
 legal
induced abortion is important for several reasons. For example,
 abortion
surveillance is used to identify characteristics of women at high
 risk of
unintended pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance is essential to monitor
 trends
in the number, ratio, and rate of abortions in the United States.
Statistics on the number of pregnancies ending in abortion are
 needed to
combine with birth statistics to provide an estimate of pregnancy
 rates
(e.g., pregnancy rates among teenagers {16}) and to calculate other
 outcome
rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic pregnancies per 1,000
 pregnancies). In
turn, abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to evaluate the
 effec-
tiveness of family planning programs and other programs to prevent
unintended pregnancy. Ongoing surveillance also allows an
 opportunity to
assess changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion
 (e.g.,
changes in types of procedure over time). Finally, abortion data
 are used
as denominators to calculate abortion morbidity rates and mortality

case-fatality rates. </p>
<p>Induced abortions usually are linked to unintended
 pregnancies, which
often occur despite the use of contraception (6,17,18). In the
 mid-1980s,
about 1.2 million live births occurred as a result of unintended
 pregnancy
(i.e., the pregnancy was either mistimed or unwanted at conception)
 (19).
Improving contraceptive practice, as well as access to and
 education about
safe, effective, and low-cost contraception and family planning
 services,
may help minimize the need for abortion in the United States (20). </p>
<p>At present, not all states have recognized the need for
 state-based
abortion surveillance, and some states that have recognized the
 need have
been unable to gather information. In the near future, a greater
 emphasis
will likely be placed on preventing unintended pregnancy,
 particularly
among teenagers. To meet this need, the number and characteristics
 of women
obtaining abortions will be needed from all states to furnish an
 accurate
characterization of legal induced abortion in this country. </p>
