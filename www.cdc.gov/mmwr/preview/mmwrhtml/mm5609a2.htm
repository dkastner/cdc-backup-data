<H1>Influenza Vaccination Coverage Among Children with Asthma --- 
United States, 2004--05 Influenza Season</FONT></H1>
</P><P>In 2005, approximately 8.9% (6.5 million) of U.S. children aged &lt;18 years were reported to have current asthma 
(<I>1</I>). Children with asthma are at high risk for complications from influenza, and influenza vaccination has been determined 
to safely and effectively reduce rates of influenza in these children 
(<I><a href="rr5306a1.htm">2</a></I>). Since its establishment in 1964, the Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended that all children with asthma aged 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months receive vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine during each influenza season; however, national influenza vaccination coverage rates 
specifically for children with asthma have not been 
determined (<I><a href="rr5306a1.htm">2</a></I>). Previous studies have assessed influenza vaccination rates in 
children with asthma at the local level using health maintenance organization and clinician group-practice information, with 
estimates ranging from 10% to 43% for various influenza seasons 
(<I>3,4</I>). Another study used Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
System (BRFSS) data to estimate influenza vaccination coverage in children aged 2--17 years with one or more conditions 
putting them at high risk for complications from influenza (including asthma, although asthma was not assessed separately); in 
that study, the national rate was estimated at 34.8% for the 2004--05 influenza season (based on a sample size of 685, 
which included all states and the District of Columbia [DC]) 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5412a3.htm">5</a></I>). To estimate national influenza vaccination coverage rates 
among children aged 2--17 years with current asthma,* CDC analyzed data from the 2005 National Health Interview 
Survey (NHIS). This report describes the results of that analysis and provides the first 
national estimates of influenza vaccination coverage among children with asthma. The findings indicated that although children with current asthma were more likely 
to receive influenza vaccination than children without current asthma, the vaccination coverage rate among children with 
asthma was low, at 29.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 24.5--33.9). These findings underscore the need to increase 
influenza vaccination coverage in children with asthma aged 2--17 years by identifying and overcoming barriers to vaccination. 
</P><P>NHIS is an ongoing, cross-sectional, in-person household interview survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized 
population of the United States. During the interview, information about one randomly selected child from each family is collected 
from an adult family member who resides in the same household as the child. The child questionnaire contains several 
questions 

that assess asthma status; in 2005, NHIS added questions regarding influenza vaccination for children. 
Because NHIS interviews are conducted throughout the year, the 2005 questions regarding receipt of influenza vaccination during the 
12 months preceding the interview could have elicited responses that referred to vaccination that occurred during the end of 
the 2003--04 influenza season, the entire 2004--05 season, or the beginning of the 2005--06 season. 
In addition, participants who were questioned during the 
2004--05 influenza season could have reported no influenza vaccination at the time of the 
survey but then received one later during the same season. To address these methodological concerns and attempt to ensure that 
the responses included in this analysis were only in reference to the 2004--05 influenza season (September 2004--February 
2005), only responses from interviews conducted during March--August 2005 were 
included in the analysis. Using this methodology, future NHIS data can be analyzed for 
influenza vaccination coverage by influenza season. 
</P><P>In this study, NHIS data from 2005 were used to estimate influenza vaccination coverage during the 2004--05 
influenza season for children aged 2--17 
years<SUP>&#134;</SUP> by asthma status and age group. Coverage also was estimated by asthma status 
and reported number of visits to a health-care provider in the preceding 12 months. 
</P><P>A total of 5,124 children aged 2--17 years were included in the analysis by age group, and 5,097 children were included 
in the analysis by number of health-care visits. Only children who were aged 2--17 years for the entire 2004--05 influenza 
season were included. A child was considered vaccinated for the 2004--05 influenza season if the child had a reported date 
of vaccination during September 2004--February 2005. Of the children in the sample with a reported influenza vaccination 
in the preceding 12 months, 7.9% were excluded from the analysis for not reporting a date of vaccination. In addition, 7.8% 
of those with a reported influenza vaccination in the preceding 12 months were not included 
because their reported date of vaccination did not occur during September 2004--February 2005 (i.e., reported vaccination occurred during months 
in which the influenza vaccine was likely 
unavailable).<B> </B>Univariate analysis was performed, and samples were weighted to 
produce national estimates. 
</P><P>Influenza vaccination coverage for the 2004--05 influenza season among children aged 2--17 years was 29.0% for children 
with current asthma and 10.3% for children without current asthma. Children with current asthma had similar rates of 
vaccination among all age groups, ranging from 32.9% to 28.0% among children aged 2--4 years and 5--12 years, 
respectively. In contrast, children without current asthma had a wider variation in vaccination coverage by age group, with younger 
children having higher rates of vaccination than older children (20.7% for ages 2--4 years versus 6.4% for ages 
13--17 years, p&lt;0.001 by <I>t </I>test) (<a href = "mm5609a2.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Calculation of influenza vaccination-coverage rates in children with current asthma who had 
experienced an asthma attack or episode during the 12 months preceding the interview indicated that these children had higher coverage rates than those 
without an attack or episode (35.9% versus 20.0%, p&lt;0.001, by chi-square test). The lowest vaccination rate among children with 
current asthma (16.4%) was for children aged 5--12 years who had not had an asthma attack or episode in the 12 months preceding 
the interview.
</P><P>Among children with the same number of health-care visits during the 12 months preceding the interview, children 
with asthma who had two through five or 
<U>&gt;</U>10 health-care visits had higher rates of influenza vaccination than children without 
asthma (<a href = "mm5609a2.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). In addition, influenza vaccination coverage among children with current asthma increased as the reported number 
of health-care visits increased. Approximately 10.8% of children with current asthma who had one health-care visit in the 
preceding year were vaccinated, whereas 42.0% of children with current asthma who had 
<U>&gt;</U>10 visits were vaccinated.

Respiratory Diseases (proposed), CDC. </I>
<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The findings in this report, based on 2005 NHIS data, include the first national estimate of 
influenza vaccination coverage in children with current asthma. The analysis indicated a lower coverage rate (29.0%) during the 
2004--05 influenza season than a previous study based on BRFSS data (34.8%) that included children with conditions placing 
them at high risk for influenza complications 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5412a3.htm">5</a></I>). Because BRFSS and NHIS have different survey methodologies, a difference 
was not unexpected. The BRFSS analysis included children with conditions other than asthma, including other lung 
problems, heart problems, diabetes, kidney problems, a weakened immune system, anemia, or aspirin therapy for chronic conditions. 
In addition, this study based on NHIS data used September--February as its time frame for influenza vaccination, whereas 
the BRFSS study used September--January. Finally, BRFSS is conducted in all states and DC, whereas NHIS uses a sampling 
method designed to produce an accurate national estimate without including all states. 
</P><P>An unexpected influenza vaccine shortage occurred during the 2004--05 influenza season. In October 2004, within days 
of the first indication of the shortage, CDC released interim recommendations for prioritizing influenza vaccine 
distribution. Children aged 2--17 years with asthma were included in the priority group of &quot;persons aged 2--64 years with 
underlying chronic conditions&quot; (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5339a6.htm">6</a></I>). This interim recommendation might have contributed to the higher influenza vaccination rates 
for children with asthma compared with children without asthma as clinicians followed recommendations; alternatively, 
the shortage might have led to an overall decrease in coverage rates among all children, including children with asthma, 
compared with rates from other seasons. The results of this analysis cannot be compared with previous years 
because 2005 was the first year that NHIS included influenza vaccination questions on the child portion of the survey. Analysis of NHIS data from 
2006 and future years will allow determination of trends in national influenza vaccination coverage in children with asthma.
</P><P>The differing coverage rates, by age, among children without current asthma likely are a result of various factors. 
For example, the high rate of vaccination in children aged 2--4 years compared with other ages might be a reflection of 
the regularly scheduled pediatric well-child visits for young children, which might result in receipt of an influenza vaccination. 
In addition, physician awareness of the increased risk for influenza complications in children aged 2--4 years might 
have contributed to this higher vaccination rate.
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, the results might be affected by recall bias, 
which might cause underreporting of vaccination directly proportional to the time between vaccination and interview. However, 
if parents of children with asthma preferentially recall influenza vaccination, this would contribute to higher coverage 
estimates for children with asthma compared with children without asthma. Second, inaccurate reporting of vaccination dates 
might cause misclassification of responses during the analysis; NHIS responses for children are based on report by an adult and 
are not confirmed by health-care providers. Finally, whether children aged 
<U>&lt;</U>9 years who were receiving their first 
influenza vaccination also received the second dose recommended by ACIP for maximum protection could not be determined on 
the basis of NHIS data (<I><a href="rr5306a1.htm">2</a></I>). 
</P><P>In February 2006, ACIP expanded its influenza vaccination recommendation to include all children aged 6--59 
months, and the committee also is evaluating a universal 
influenza vaccination strategy (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5510a1.htm">7</a></I>). Continued monitoring of 
influenza vaccination coverage among children with asthma in future influenza seasons is needed to determine how 
these recommendations affect coverage rates in this population.
</P><P>The findings in this analysis indicate that influenza vaccination coverage among children with asthma is inadequate and 
that opportunities for vaccination during health-care provider visits likely are being missed. Previous studies have 
assessed methods to improve influenza vaccination rates, such as year-round scheduling of fall and winter influenza vaccination 
appointments and computerized reminder systems 
(<I>8,9</I>). In one study, the percentage of children with asthma who received at least 1 dose 
of influenza vaccine increased from 23.2% to 35.1% (p&lt;0.001) after implementation of a year-round scheduling policy 
(<I>8</I>).
</P><P>National trends in coverage should be monitored so that public health policies can better target vaccination of all 
children with asthma, and correlates of vaccination among children with asthma should be explored so that measures can be 
developed for groups of children with asthma who have the lowest rates of vaccination. Increasing influenza vaccination coverage in 
this population will help decrease influenza and its associated complications.
