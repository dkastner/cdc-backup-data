<h1>Update: Blood Lead Levels -- United States, 1991-1994 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Lead is an environmental toxicant that may deleteriously
affect the nervous, hematopoietic, endocrine, renal, and
reproductive systems (1). Lead exposure in young children is a
particular hazard because children absorb lead more readily than do

adults and because the developing nervous systems of children are
more susceptible to the effects of lead (2). Blood lead levels
(BLLs) at least as low as 10 ug/dL can adversely affect the
behavior and development of children (2). CDC's National Health and

Nutrition Examination surveys (NHANES), an ongoing series of
national examinations of the health and nutritional status of the
civilian noninstitutionalized population, have been the primary
source for monitoring BLLs in the U.S. population. From NHANES II
(conducted during 1976-1980) to Phase 1 of NHANES III (conducted
during October 1988-September 1991), the geometric mean (GM) BLL
for persons aged 1-74 years declined from 12.8 ug/dL to 2.9 ug/dL,
and the prevalence of elevated BLLs (BLLs greater than or equal to
10 ug/dL) decreased from 77.8% to 4.4% (3). * This report updates
national BLL estimates with data from Phase 2 of NHANES III
(conducted during October 1991-September 1994), which indicate that

BLLs in the U.S. population aged greater than or equal to 1 year
continued to decrease and that BLLs among children aged 1-5 years
were more likely to be elevated among those who were poor,
non-Hispanic black, living in large metropolitan areas, or living
in older housing. </p>
<p>In NHANES III, blacks, Mexican Americans, children aged 2
months-5 years, and persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years
were oversampled to increase the reliability of estimates for these

groups (4). A household interview and a physical examination were
conducted for each survey participant. During the physical
examination, 1 mL of whole blood was collected by venipuncture from

examinees aged greater than or equal to 1 year. Graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrophotometry was used to measure BLLs at a
detection limit of 1 ug/dL (5); BLLs below the level of detection
were assigned a value of 0.7 ug/dL. </p>
<p>In this analysis, income categories were defined using the
poverty-income ratio (PIR; the ratio of total family income to the
poverty threshold for the year of the interview); low income was
defined as PIR less than or equal to 1.300; middle, as PIR
 1.301-3.500;
and high, as PIR greater than or equal to 3.501. Urban
status was based on U.S. Department of Agriculture codes that
classify counties by total population and proximity to major
metropolitan areas (6 ); the two categories used were metropolitan
areas with a population greater than or equal to 1 million and
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas with a population less than
1 million. Data on the age-of-housing variable were collected by
self-report using three categories (built before 1946, during
 1946-1973,
and after 1973); these cutpoints closely correspond to years
in which the amount of lead contained in residential paint was
altered (2) **. The sample included 13,642 persons; 2392 were
children aged 1-5 years. Data for racial/ethnic groups other than
non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and Mexican American were
too small for reliable estimates. Statistical analyses were
performed using Software for Survey Data Analysis, which accounted
for the complex sample design. Asymmetric 95% confidence intervals
were calculated using the natural logarithmic transformation (7). </p>
<p>During 1991-1994, the overall GM BLL of the U.S. population
aged greater than or equal to 1 year was 2.3 ug/dL (<a href="00048339.htm#00002263.htm">Table_1</a>).
 GM
BLLs varied by age and were highest among children aged 1-2 years
and persons aged greater than or equal to 50 years. Among those
aged greater than or equal to 1 year, approximately 2.2% had BLLs
greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL (<a href="00048339.htm#00002263.htm">Table_1</a>). Among those aged
 1-5
years, approximately 4.4% had BLLs greater than or equal to 10
ug/dL (<a href="00048339.htm#00002263.htm">Table_1</a>), representing an estimated 930,000 children
 aged 1-5
years in the United States with BLLs greater than or equal to 10
ug/dL. In addition, among children aged 1-5 years, approximately
1.3% had BLLs greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL, and 0.4% had BLLs
greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL. </p>
<p>For children aged 1-5 years, the prevalence of BLLs greater
than or equal to 10 ug/dL was higher among those who were
non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican Americans, from lower-income
families, living in metropolitan areas with a population greater
than or equal to 1 million, or living in older housing
 (<a href="00048339.htm#00002264.htm">Table_2</a>).
The differences in risk for an elevated BLL by race/ethnicity,
income, and urban status generally persisted across age-of-housing
categories. Similarly, the higher risk for an elevated BLL
associated with older age of housing generally persisted across
race/ethnicity, income, and urban status categories. Therefore, the

risk for an elevated BLL was higher among non-Hispanic black
children living in housing built before 1946 (21.9%) or built
during 1946-1973 (13.7%), among children in low-income households
who lived in housing built before 1946 (16.4%), and among children
in areas with populations greater than or equal to 1 million who
live in housing built before 1946 (11.5%) when compared with
children in other categories. Based on a multivariate logistic
regression model, non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity, low income,
and living in housing built before 1946 were independent predictors

of elevated BLLs in children aged 1-5 years. Living in urban areas
was not an independent predictor of elevated BLLs when controlling
for race/ethnicity, income, and age of housing. </p>
<p>For the total population, GM BLLs decreased by 21.7% from
Phase 1 to Phase 2 with minimal variation within age, sex,
race/ethnicity, income, age-of-housing, and urban status groups
(range: 17.4%-26.4%). Among children aged 1-5 years, the overall
absolute decrease in the prevalence of elevated BLLs from Phase 1
to Phase 2 was 4.1 percentage points. The percentage point decrease

was generally greater among those groups with higher prevalences of

elevated BLLs during Phase 1: children aged 1-2 years (5.2),
non-Hispanic black children (7.4), children from low-income
families (6.9), children living in areas with a population less
than 1 million (5.3), and children living in housing built before
1946 (9.6). Conversely, the percentage decrease of elevated BLLs
from Phase 1 to Phase 2 was 48.4% among all children aged 1-5 years

and generally was smaller among those groups at highest risk for
elevated BLLs. </p>

Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, and Div of Environmental
Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: The findings in this analysis of NHANES III data
indicate that the GM BLL for the U.S. population aged greater than
or equal to 1 year decreased by 22% from Phase 1 to Phase 2, and
the prevalence of BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL decreased
by 51% over the same period. However, constraints of the survey
design of NHANES III precluded statistical testing for the
differences in GM BLLs and the prevalences of elevated BLLs from
Phase 1 to Phase 2. The decrease in BLLs observed from Phase 1 to
Phase 2 follow even larger decreases from NHANES II (1976-1980) to
Phase 1 of NHANES III. Among persons aged 1-74 years, the GM BLL
declined 77% from NHANES II to Phase 1 of NHANES III, and the
prevalence of BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL decreased by
94% (3). </p>
<p>The dramatic decline in BLLs in the U.S. population since the
late 1970s is probably a direct consequence of the regulatory and
voluntary bans enacted during this period on the use of lead in
gasoline, household paint, food and drink cans, and plumbing
systems (2). The effects of these changes benefited all U.S.
population groups studied. In addition, BLLs may have been reduced
in some groups as the result of childhood lead poisoning-prevention

efforts undertaken by public health agencies, lead paint-abatement
programs, and the promulgation of a standard for lead exposure in
industry. </p>
<p>Despite the recent and large declines in BLLs, the risk for
lead exposure remains disproportionately high for some groups,
including children who are poor, non-Hispanic black, Mexican
American, living in large metropolitan areas, or living in older
housing. Although confidence intervals for elevated BLL prevalence
estimates overlapped across age-of-housing and urban status
categories for all children aged 1-5 years, the overall direction
of the risk differentials is consistent with results from previous
years (8). In addition, with the exception of urban status -- which

was too broadly defined in this study to reflect gradations of risk

associated with residence in a central city versus residence in
outlying metropolitan or suburban areas -- each of these factors
 was
an independent contributor to the risk for elevated BLLs among
children. </p>
<p>The risk for lead exposure in children is primarily determined

by environmental conditions of the child's residence. The most
common source for lead exposure for children is lead-based paint
that has deteriorated into paint chips and lead dust (2). In the
United States, approximately 83% of privately owned housing units
and 86% of public housing units built before 1980 contain some
lead-based paint (9). In addition, soil and dust contaminated with
residual lead fallout from vehicle exhaust contribute to exposure;
concentrations of lead in soil and dust are highest in central
urban areas (10). For adults, the most common high-dose exposure
sources are occupational (1). Other exposure sources for adults and

children can include lead dust brought into the home on clothing
from workplaces, lead used for some hobbies, lead contained in some

&quot;folk&quot; medicines and cosmetics, and lead in plumbing and in crystal

and ceramic containers that leaches into water or food (2). </p>
<p>Despite the substantial progress in eliminating sources of
lead in the United States, the NHANES data indicate that nearly 1
million children aged 1-5 years had elevated BLLs during 1991-1994.

In addition to efforts to reduce or eliminate sources of lead and
exposure to lead, screening efforts are necessary for early
identification of children with elevated BLLs to enable prompt and
appropriate environmental, educational, and medical interventions. </p>
<p>Because the distribution of risk for childhood lead exposure
varies widely within the United States, prevention activities must
be conducted at the local level and must be appropriate to local
conditions. In areas where the risk for elevated BLLs is low,
screening efforts should be targeted to children who remain at
elevated risk for lead exposure. CDC is developing guidelines to
assist state and local health departments in designing screening
recommendations appropriate to their jurisdictions. A draft of
these guidelines is available for public review and comment through

April 7, 1997; copies can be obtained by calling (888) 232-6789 or

   metropolitan areas with a population &gt;=1million and metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas with a population &lt;1 million.
