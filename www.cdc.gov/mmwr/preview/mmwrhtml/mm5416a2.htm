<H1>Silicosis Mortality, Prevention, and Control --- United States, 1968--2002</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Silicosis is a preventable occupational lung disease caused by inhaling dust containing crystalline silica 
(<I>1</I>); no effective treatment for silicosis is available. Deaths from inhalation of silica-containing dust can occur after a few months' exposure (<I>1</I>). Crystalline silica exposure and silicosis have been associated with work in mining, quarrying, tunneling, 

sandblasting, masonry, foundry work, glass manufacture, ceramic and pottery production, cement and concrete production, and work with certain materials in dental laboratories. To describe 
patterns of silicosis mortality in the United States, CDC analyzed 
data from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) National Occupational Respiratory 
Mortality System (NORMS) for 1968--2002. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated a decline in silicosis mortality during 1968--2002 and suggested that progress has been made in reducing the incidence of silicosis in the United States. However, silicosis deaths and new cases still occur, even in young workers. Because no 
effective treatment for silicosis is available, effective control of exposure to crystalline silica in the workplace is crucial. </P><P>NORMS contains national mortality data obtained annually since 1968 from the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) for asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, silicosis, pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, and other 
respiratory diseases and conditions (<I>2</I>). For this report, silicosis deaths were identified during 1968--2002, the most recent years for which complete data were available, and include any death certificates for which an 
<I>International Classification of Diseases</I> 

(ICD) code* for silicosis was listed as either the underlying or contributing cause of death. Death rates (per million persons aged <U>&gt;</U>15 years) were age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. The age-adjusted mortality rates were mapped by county by using geographic information system software. Codes for usual occupation or industry were available for 1985--1999 from 
26 states<SUP>&#134;</SUP>. The proportionate mortality 
ratio (PMR<SUP>&#167;</SUP>) for silicosis was calculated by occupation and industry. For this 
analysis, PMR was adjusted by age, sex, and race, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by using Poisson regression analysis.
</P><P>During 1968--2002, of approximately 74 million death certificates, silicosis was recorded as the underlying or contributing cause of death on 16,305; a total of 15,944 (98%) deaths occurred in males. From 1968 to 2002, the number of silicosis deaths decreased from 1,157 (8.91 per million persons aged 

<U>&gt;</U>15 years) to 148 (0.66) (<a href = "mm5416a2.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>), corresponding to a 
93% </P><P>
</P><P>
decline in the overall mortality rate. The racial distribution of persons who died from silicosis was approximately 88% (14,310 decedents) white, 12% (1,925) black, and &lt;1% (70) other race. Since 1995, on average, 30 deaths per year have been recorded among persons aged 15--64 years. 
</P><P>During 1968--2002, the age-adjusted silicosis mortality rate was elevated in several counties in western states 
(Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington), eastern states (Georgia, Kentucky, New York, North Carolina, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania, 

Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia), and central 
states (Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Vermont, and Wisconsin). San Juan County, Colorado, had the highest age-adjusted mortality rate (524 per million persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>15 years) (<a href = "mm5416a2.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>).
</P><P>For usual industry and occupation codes, a total of 1,400 silicosis deaths were reported in the 26 states for one or more selected years during 1985--1999. Metal mining had the highest PMR (39.2; CI = 32.9--46.8) among industries (<a href = "mm5416a2.htm#tab">Table</a>). Among occupations, miscellaneous metal and 

plastic-processing machine operator had the highest PMR (90.1; CI = 
51.5--146.3).

Safety and Health, CDC.</I>
<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The greatest death toll from silicosis in the United States 
occurred with excavation of Hawk's Nest Tunnel, critical to the construction of a hydroelectric plant in West Virginia during 1930--1931. Approximately 5,000 workers bored through Gauley Mountain to create the tunnel; an estimated 2,500 worked 
inside. A subsequent study determined that silicosis claimed the lives of at least 764 workers at Hawk's Nest Tunnel 
(<I>4</I>). By the end of 1937, a total of 46 states had 

passed laws relevant to workers with silicosis.
</P><P>The findings in this report indicate a decline in silicosis mortality during 1968--2002. Two main factors are 
likely responsible for this trend. First, many of the deaths in the early part of the study period 
occurred among persons whose main exposure to crystalline silica dust probably occurred 
before introduction of national compliance standards for silica 
dust exposure (the Mine Safety and Health Administration [MSHA] and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration use permissible exposure limits [PELs] based on the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold 
limit value). These limits began to be applied in the early 1970s and included indirect control through regulation of mixed mine dust in underground coal mines by using the MSHA 

formula<SUP>&#182;</SUP> (<I>5</I>). These regulatory limits, coupled with 
other recommendations such as that by NIOSH in 1974 (i.e., recommended exposure limit [REL] to respirable crystalline 
silica shall not exceed 0.05 mg/m<SUP>3</SUP>) 
(<I>6</I>), likely has led to reduced silica dust exposures since the 1970s. Ancillary 
preventive measures (e.g., respiratory protection, posting 
warning signs, and recordkeeping or reporting occupational illnesses) might also 
have reduced personal exposures. The second major factor relates to declining employment in heavy industries (e.g., 
mining industry from 989,400 employees in 1980 to 512,200 in 2002), where silica exposures were 
prevalent. 
</P><P>Despite the reductions in mortality associated with silicosis, silica overexposure remains widespread, indicating a need for hazard surveillance and developing work place--specific interventions. An estimated 121,100 workers were exposed to equal 
to or greater than the NIOSH REL in 1993 (<I>7</I>). The industries with the largest number of workers exposed include research and testing services (46,200 workers), masonry (20,400), heavy construction (12,200 [excluding highway construction]), and 
iron and steel foundries (8,600). Industries with fewer workers include painting and paper hanging (5,100), structural 
clay products (2,100), metal services (1,300), and cut stone (700) 
(<I>7</I>). By industry, metal mining had the highest PMR for 
1985--1999. At least 12% of metal mining exposures exceeded the MSHA PEL during 1990--1999 

(<I>8</I>). Findings from the Sentinel Event Notification 
Systems for Occupational Risks indicated that 58% of reported cases of silicosis from Michigan, 
New Jersey, and Ohio occurred in workers in primary metal industries 
(<I>9</I>). Additional industries with elevated PMRs 
involved miscellaneous nonmetallic and stone products and pottery and 
related products. The pottery industry deals with 
silica-containing clay, which is the raw material for manufacturing crockery, 
pottery, and flint.
</P><P>The geographic patterns of silicosis offer some guidance for intervention. By county, the greatest age-adjusted mortality rates were clustered in western states, northeastern states, and north Atlantic states. The mortality rates in counties in these states were often associated with mining or construction 

industries. For example, the high age-adjusted death rate in Lawrence County, South Dakota (38.3 per million persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>15 years), might be associated with gold mining in that area. A 
study of 3,328 gold miners exposed to silica in South Dakota reported an increased risk for silicosis 
(<I>9</I>).
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. First, accuracy of the coding of usual industry and occupation on death certificates was not verifiable because individual work histories are not listed on death certificates. 
Second, codes for usual industry and occupation were available only for the period 1985--1999 for 26 states; thus, these data might not be nationally representative. Twenty-four states do not provide decedents' employment data to NCHS. Third, 
the state of residence at death is not always the state in which decedents' exposures occurred. Fourth, no exposure information is listed on death certificates. Therefore, no silica exposure-response relationship was evaluated. Finally, physicians might have misclassified or underreported silicosis deaths. 

</P><P>Despite these limitations, NORMS can provide useful information on silicosis by location, industry, and 
occupation, suggesting ways to target preventive intervention. The decreased silicosis mortality trends suggest that considerable progress has been made toward elimination of silicosis since 1968. However, silicosis deaths and new cases are still occurring, even in young workers in the United States. Because no effective treatment for silicosis is available, primary prevention 

(i.e., engineering or other control of exposure) should be maintained or improved to reduce worker morbidity and mortality.
