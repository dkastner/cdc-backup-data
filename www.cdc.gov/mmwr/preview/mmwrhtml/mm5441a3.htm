<H1>Influenza Vaccination Levels Among Persons Aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 Years and Among Persons Aged 18--64 Years with High-Risk Conditions --- United 
States, 2003</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Influenza vaccination is an effective tool for preventing hospitalization and death among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and among persons aged 18--64 years with medical conditions that increase the risk for influenza-related complications 
(<I>1</I>). Two national health objectives for 2010 are to increase influenza vaccination coverage to 90% among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and to 60% among persons aged 18--64 years who have one or more high-risk conditions (objectives 
14-29a and 14-29c, respectively)<SUP> 
</SUP>(<I>2</I>). To determine influenza vaccination coverage among persons in both targeted groups, CDC analyzed data from the 
2003 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined 
that influenza vaccination coverage among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and persons aged 18--64 years with high-risk conditions 
remains substantially below 2010 target levels. In addition, racial/ethnic disparities in coverage levels persist in both 
targeted populations. To improve overall influenza vaccination coverage and reduce racial/ethnic disparities, combinations of 
evidence-based effective interventions should be implemented 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5405a1.htm">3</a></I>), and the influenza vaccine supply should be stabilized 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5412a3.htm">4</a></I>). 
</P><P>NHIS is conducted using face-to-face interviews among the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. 
Questions regarding influenza vaccination are part of the sample adult core questionnaire, which collects information regarding 
the health of one randomly selected adult in each family. All 
respondents were asked, &quot;During the past 12 months, have you had 
a flu shot?&quot; In 1994, only half-year data were available. In 1990, 1992, and 1996, influenza vaccination questions were 
not included in the questionnaire. Therefore, midpoint values between the preceding and following years were used to 
estimate coverage in those years. Before 1997, vaccination coverage among persons by high-risk group could not be assessed 
for purpose of comparison because the questionnaire was redesigned in 1997 and information on health conditions was 
not collected in the same manner.
</P><P>NHIS data for 2003 were analyzed to estimate influenza vaccination coverage in the targeted populations by race/ethnicity 
and sociodemographic characteristics, including access to health care. Trends in annual estimates during 1989--2003 were 
evaluated. Final response rates for the adult core sample during 1997--2003 ranged from 69.6% to 80.4%; the response rate in 2003 
was 74.2%. Only non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics were included in the analysis for 2003, totaling 
5,538 adults aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years and 4,238 adults aged 18--64 years with high-risk conditions. Samples were weighted to produce 
national estimates. Univariate analysis was conducted using statistical software to account for the complex survey 
design. Associations between coverage levels and characteristics were measured using 95% confidence intervals. 
Persons with high-risk conditions had one or more of the following: ever being told by a physician they had diabetes, emphysema, coronary 
heart 

disease, angina, heart attack, or other heart condition; receiving a diagnosis of cancer during the preceding 12 months 
(excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) or ever being told by a physician they had lymphoma, leukemia, or blood cancer; 
being told by a physician during the preceding 12 months they had chronic bronchitis or weak or failing kidneys; or having an asthma episode 
or attack during the preceding 12 months.
</P><P>In 2003, influenza vaccination levels varied by age group, race/ethnicity, presence of high-risk medical conditions, and 
other characteristics. coverage among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years was 65.6%. Racial/ethnic--specific estimates of coverage were 
68.7% for non-Hispanic whites, 48.0% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 45.4% for Hispanics (<a href = "mm5441a3.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Combining the three 
racial/ethnic populations, the following characteristics were associated with lower coverage levels: age 65--74 years, less than a 
high school education, income below the poverty threshold, no supplemental health insurance, no high-risk conditions, and 
fewer doctor visits in the preceding 12 months. Among persons aged 18--64 years with high-risk conditions, influenza 
vaccination coverage was 34.1% (<a href = "mm5441a3.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). Racial/ethnic--specific estimates of coverage among persons aged 18--64 years with 
high-risk conditions were 35.8% for non-Hispanic whites, 30.4% for non-Hispanic blacks, and 27.0% for Hispanics. 
Characteristics associated with lower coverage levels in the combined racial/ethnic groups were age 18--49 years, less than high 
school education, income near (100%--199%) or below (&lt;100%) the poverty threshold, no health insurance, and fewer doctor 
visits during the preceding 12 months. Among Hispanics aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years, those who were interviewed in Spanish had a 
vaccination coverage level that was nearly two thirds the level for those interviewed in English. Among persons aged 50--64 
years, influenza vaccination coverage was 46.3% for persons with high-risk conditions and 32.7% for persons without 
high-risk conditions.
</P><P>Trends over time differed by race/ethnicity and age group. During 1989--1997, among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, influenza vaccination coverage among non-Hispanic whites 
increased from 32.1% in 1989 to 66.0% in 1997, then 
remained nearly stable through 2003 except for a limited 
decrease in 2001 (<a href = "mm5441a3.htm#fig">Figure</a>). At a lower level of coverage, a similar pattern 
existed among non-Hispanic blacks. Among Hispanics, however, vaccination coverage declined from 55.7% in 2000 to 45.4% 
in 2003, and the gap in vaccination rates between Hispanics and non-Hispanic whites increased from 10.9% to 23.3% 
during the same period. 
</P><P>among all persons aged 18--64 years (with and without high-risk conditions), influenza vaccination coverage increased 
from 5.0% in 1989 to 22.1% in 2003, except for a limited decrease in 2001. Among persons aged 18--64 years with 
high-risk conditions, a similar trend was observed during 1997--2003.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> The findings in this report indicate that 
influenza vaccination coverage since 2000 has increased only 
slightly among non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and among younger adults with high-risk 
conditions and decreased among Hispanics aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years. Given these trends, the national health targets for influenza 
vaccination coverage of 90% for persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and 60% for persons aged 18--64 years with one or more high-risk condition 
will not be met by 2010. In addition, racial/ethnic disparities in coverage levels were observed, with lower coverage among 
non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics than among non-Hispanic whites of both targeted populations. These disparities 
underscore the need to implement more widespread effective interventions (e.g., standing orders and provider and patient 
reminders), especially among certain racial/ethnic populations, to achieve national objectives for influenza vaccination coverage 
among persons aged <U>&gt;</U>65 years and persons aged 18--64 years with high-risk conditions.
</P><P>Multiple characteristics continue to be associated with lower influenza vaccination coverage and poor progress toward 
the national health objectives, including low household income, less than a high school education, less health insurance 
coverage, and fewer doctor visits. One study determined a stronger association between opposition to vaccination and 
lower influenza vaccination coverage among non-Hispanic blacks than other groups 
(<I>5</I>). low coverage might be related, in part, 
to how non-Hispanic blacks respond to prevention messages and guidelines 
(<I>6</I>). Among Hispanics, those who were 
interviewed in Spanish had lower vaccination coverage than those interviewed in English, indicating that a greater availability of 
Spanish-speaking health-care providers and communication materials in Spanish might help to achieve higher coverage in the 
Hispanic population. Among Hispanics aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years, reasons for the decline in coverage, beginning in 2001, are not known; 
however, 

the decline was observed primarily among Hispanics who were interviewed in Spanish (CDC, unpublished data, 
2005). Research is needed to gain insight into the causes of this pattern and reverse it.
</P><P>Although a leveling of influenza vaccination coverage has been observed since 1998, the instability of the vaccine 
supply during recent years might have contributed to impeding progress toward the 2010 influenza vaccination targets. The 
decrease in coverage in 2001 likely was caused by the delayed supply of influenza vaccine during the 2000--01 influenza season 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4927a4.htm">7</a></I>). A less severe delay occurred during the 2001--02 season but did not result in a decrease in coverage. Progress will continue to 
be slowed if vaccine supply shortages such as that during the 2004--05 influenza season cannot be avoided 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5412a3.htm">4</a></I>). The effect of the vaccine shortage during the 2004--05 season on future demand for influenza vaccine, potentially as a result of reduced 
risk perception among persons who deferred vaccination, has yet to be determined. Continued surveillance for 
vaccination coverage is needed to assess the effects of fluctuations in available vaccine doses.
</P><P>No national target for influenza vaccination coverage among persons aged 50--64 years exists; however, since 2000, 
the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended influenza vaccination for all persons in this 
age group (<I><a href="rr5408a1.htm">8</a></I>). Data from the 2003 NHIS indicate that coverage for persons with and without high-risk conditions in this 
age group remains below 50%. National health objectives for the group aged 50--64 years should be considered to help 
promote increased coverage. 
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, influenza vaccination status is self-reported 
and, therefore, subject to recall bias. However, a previous study has demonstrated that the sensitivity and specificity of 
self-reported influenza vaccination are high among adults 
(<I>9</I>). Second, a multivariable model was not used to adjust for 
potential confounding. Third, data for the 2003 NHIS are gathered from interviews conducted during the entire calendar year 
and primarily reflect the 2002--03 influenza season but also include vaccinations occurring in smaller portions of the 
preceding and subsequent seasons, reducing specificity of coverage estimates. Finally, total coverage for each age group might not 
be generalizable to the entire U.S. population for those age groups because only three racial/ethnic populations were included 
in the analysis. 
</P><P>To further improve vaccination coverage among adults, ACIP recommends standing orders for influenza vaccination 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4901a2.htm">10</a></I>). In addition, a recent systematic review by the Task Force on Community Preventive Services recommends 
combining interventions to increase vaccination rates, such as 1) increasing community demand for vaccinations, 2) enhancing access 
to vaccination services, and 3) implementing provider-based or system-based interventions 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5405a1.htm">3</a></I>). Other factors that might help improve influenza vaccination coverage levels among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>65 years and persons aged 18--64 years with 
high-risk conditions include stabilizing the vaccine supply for each influenza season and developing infrastructure to 
vaccinate uninsured persons aged 18--64 years with high-risk conditions.
