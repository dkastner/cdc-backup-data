<H1>Suspected Cutaneous Anthrax in a Laboratory Worker --- Texas, 2002</FONT></H1>
      <P>On March 6, 2002, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) received a request for a 
health hazard evaluation from the director of Laboratory A to assist in the evaluation of a worker who had been diagnosed 
with cutaneous anthrax. Laboratory A, a provisionally approved Laboratory Response Network level B laboratory, had 
been processing environmental samples for <I>Bacillus 
anthracis</I> in support of CDC investigations of the bioterrorist attacks in 
the United States during fall 2001. Since March 7, CDC has interviewed the ill laboratory worker and other workers at 
the laboratory and conducted environmental assessments of the workplace. This report summarizes the epidemiologic 
and environmental investigation of this case, which indicates that the likely source of exposure was the surface of vials 
containing <I>B. anthracis</I> isolates that the worker placed in a freezer on March 1. Laboratory workers handling specimens of 
<I>B. anthracis</I> should follow recommended procedures to minimize the risk of 
<I>B. anthracis</I> transmission and anthrax.
</P><P>The laboratory worker was one of three employees of Laboratory A who had primary responsibility for 
processing environmental <I>B. anthracis</I> specimens. Neither this worker nor any of the other approximately 40 employees of Laboratory 
A had received anthrax vaccine. The laboratory worker did not handle 
<I>B. anthracis</I>-containing samples or cultures 
during February 19--28. On February 28, he cut a small bump on his right jaw while shaving, which bled briefly and then 
became itchy and irritated. On March 1, he assisted a co-worker moving vials containing aliquots of confirmed 
<I>B. anthracis</I> isolates from the biological safety cabinet (BSC) in the main laboratory to the freezer in an adjacent room. The co-worker 
had transferred the isolates from blood agar plates to the vials by collecting the growth with a swab. 
The co-worker removed the vials from the BSC and handed them to the patient. Without 
gloves, the patient took the vials from the co-worker, placed 
the vials in the freezer, and then washed his hands with soap and water. During the next 2--3 days, the worker's facial 
wound increased in size and developed a scab. He also reported right cervical adenopathy, a low-grade fever, and swelling 
and erythema on his right cheek and neck. The patient's health-care provider obtained a swab of the area underneath the scab 
and of the area under a vesicle, without cleansing the skin first. The health-care provider made a presumptive diagnosis 
of cutaneous anthrax and the patient was administered a 2-week course of ciprofloxacin.
</P><P>The culture of this specimen was positive for 
<I>B. anthracis</I> on testing at Laboratory A and CDC. Because of culture 
results, the patient was admitted to the hospital on March 5 and treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin and doxycycline 
pending antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The lesion developed the characteristic eschar of cutaneous anthrax 
(<a href = "mm5113a4.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). A chest radiograph performed on admission demonstrated possible fullness of the mediastinum, but computed tomography of 
the chest was normal. The isolate was susceptible to ciprofloxacin and doxycycline, and the patient continued 
receiving ciprofloxacin. The patient's symptoms improved during hospitalization, and he was discharged on March 9. Serologic 
studies for antibodies to <I>B. anthracis</I> are planned.  
</P><P>On March 5, Laboratory A's certified industrial hygienist (CIH) performed environmental sampling of both Laboratory 
A and the patient's residence. Seven wipe samples were taken at the laboratory (i.e., the top of the vials the patient had 
handled, the key to the freezer where the vials were placed, the doorknob of the freezer room, the centrifuge where specimens 
are prepared, the two BSCs where specimens are handled, and surfaces in the patient's office in Laboratory A), seven were 
taken at the patient's residence. The CIH then cleaned surfaces and equipment throughout the laboratory and the 
patient's residence by using a disinfectant containing a phenolic and a quaternary ammonium compound, which are not 
sporicidal. The environmental samples were analyzed in Laboratory A. All samples were negative except the wipe sample collected 
from tops of the vials that the patient had handled, which was positive for 
<I>B. anthracis</I>. Confirmation of the vial top specimen 
at CDC is planned.
</P><P>Workers reported that specimen processing of environmental samples suspected of 
containing<I> B. anthracis</I> is done under Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) conditions 
(<I>1</I>). These samples, including swab, wipe, dust (collected onto filter media by 
a vacuum), and air samples, are opened in a Class II, Type A BSC in a room designated for acid-fast bacillus specimens 
(AFB room). Personal protective equipment (PPE) for procedures performed in this room includes disposable, 
fluid-resistant laboratory coats, gloves, and either a NIOSH-certified N95 or P100 disposable, filtering-facepiece respirator, which 
are disposed of into a biohazard container before exiting the room. Work with purified 
<I>B. anthracis</I> cultures is performed in a separate BSC located in the main laboratory room. PPE at this workstation consists of gloves and a laboratory coat. 
Aliquots of confirmed isolates of <I>B. 
anthracis</I> are placed in vials and stored in a locked freezer in a room located off the 
main laboratory. A 10% bleach solution is routinely used to decontaminate surfaces after processing specimens 
potentially containing <I>B. anthracis.</I> However, because bleach caused labels to become dislodged, storage vials had been sprayed with 
70% isopropyl alcohol instead of being wiped with bleach. By the time of the CDC site visit, Laboratory A personnel had 
obtained labels for storage vials that would not dislodge with bleach.   
</P><P>On March 7 and 8, CDC interviewed Laboratory A workers; none reported illness among other employees or their 
family members. CDC also conducted environmental sampling at Laboratory A on March 7, consisting of 40 surface wipe and 
36 air samples. Wipe samples obtained with sterile polyester/rayon pads, moistened with sterile water, were collected from 
various surfaces in the laboratory and in the adjacent office area, including desks, flooring, door knobs, BSCs, heating, 
ventilation, air-conditioning return air grills, and laboratory equipment (including the centrifuge and shaker used for 
processing environmental samples). Air samples were collected in three locations in the laboratory: the AFB room, the area adjacent 
to the BSC used for anthrax work, and the general microbiology area; two locations in the adjacent office area; and outdoors. 
All environmental samples were negative for <I>B. 
anthracis</I> at CDC.
</P><P>On March 8, CDC performed a building assessment, including a ventilation survey, airflow distribution mapping, and 
BSC characterization. The AFB room was not under negative pressure in relation to adjacent areas of the main laboratory; 
however, the laboratory was under negative pressure relative to the outside and to the adjacent office areas. The BSCs were 
functioning adequately.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
      <P> The findings of this investigation indicate that the worker at Laboratory A likely developed 
cutaneous anthrax because of skin exposure to a contaminated surface. The health hazard evaluation also identified 
additional steps Laboratory A should take to ensure 
worker safety.
</P><P>Because <I>B. anthracis </I>can cause lethal infections and can form infectious aerosols, CDC and the National Institutes 
of Health recommend that laboratories producing quantities or concentrations of 
<I>B. anthracis</I> (i.e., culturing the organism 
for diagnostic purposes) apply practices appropriate to BSL-3 conditions 
(<I>1</I>). BSL-3 practices emphasize primary and 
secondary barriers to protect personnel in contiguous areas from exposure to potentially infectious aerosols. A vigorous program 
of routine decontamination with a 10% bleach solution is needed to kill viable 
<I>B. anthracis</I> spores on laboratory surfaces 
and vials. Alcohol is not sufficient to eliminate viable 
<I>B. anthracis</I> spores from contaminated surfaces 
(<I>2</I>). Gloves should be used whenever handling material that contains or might contain 
<I>B. anthracis,</I> and skin defects should be covered with 
an impermeable occlusive bandage while working in the laboratory. Work should be organized so that all 
<I>B. anthracis</I> sample manipulations are performed in a single room with most procedures performed in a BSC. Access to such rooms should 
be limited to laboratorians directly working with the samples.
</P><P>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices developed guidelines for routine vaccination with anthrax vaccine 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4915a1.htm">3</a></I>). This suspected case of laboratory-acquired cutaneous anthrax highlights the need for anthrax vaccination, in addition 
to standard laboratory safety procedures, for laboratorians who work routinely with 
<I>B. anthracis</I> specimens. CDC will work with state and local health 
departments to identify and vaccinate these laboratory workers.
</P><P>This case is defined by CDC as a suspected case of cutaneous anthrax rather than a confirmed case 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5041a1.htm">4</a></I>) because processing of the swab of the lesion at the same laboratory where the suspected exposure occurred introduces the possibility 
of contamination of the patient's sample with <I>B. 
anthracis</I> from the laboratory. However, this patient's clinical syndrome 
and 

environmental exposure are consistent with cutaneous anthrax 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5041a1.htm">4</a></I>). CDC will update the surveillance status of this case as 
the results of other laboratory tests (e.g., serologic tests) become available.
</P><P>Any exposure leading to a suspected case of cutaneous anthrax requires a public health investigation to identify 
other exposures in the same setting that might have led to other cases of cutaneous or inhalational anthrax. Local public 
health authorities should be notified immediately and appropriate laboratory procedures followed when treating clinicians 
suspect anthrax. This investigation did not identify inhalation exposures, and CDC does not recommend prophylaxis for 
the prevention of cutaneous anthrax. Active surveillance for cutaneous and inhalational disease should be ongoing 
among laboratorians working with <I>B. anthracis.</I>
