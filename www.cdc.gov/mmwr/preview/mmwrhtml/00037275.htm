<p>Summary </p>
<p>Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is the most common
 opportunistic
infection in children who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
 (AIDS).
Despite the publication of guidelines for prophylaxis against PCP
 for
children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in 1991
 (1),
ongoing AIDS surveillance has detected no substantial decrease in
 PCP
incidence among HIV-infected infants. Studies indicate that this
 continued
incidence is associated with failure to identify HIV-infected
 children
before PCP occurs and with limitations in the ability of CD4+
 measurements
to identify children at risk for PCP. In March 1994, the National
 Pediatric
&amp; Family HIV Resource Center, * in collaboration with CDC, convened
 a
working group to review additional data about the occurrence of PCP
 among
HIV-infected children and to reevaluate the 1991 PCP prophylaxis
 guidelines
for children. This report summarizes these new data and presents
 revised
PCP prevention guidelines that recommend a) promptly identifying
 children
born to HIV-infected women and initiating regular diagnostic and
immunologic monitoring of such children; b) beginning PCP
 prophylaxis at
4-6 weeks of age for all children who have been perinatally exposed
 to HIV;
c) continuing prophylaxis through 12 months of age for HIV-infected

children; and d) making decisions regarding prophylaxis for
 HIV-infected
children greater than or equal to 12 months of age based on CD4+
measurements and whether PCP previously has occurred. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1991, guidelines for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis
 carinii
pneumonia (PCP) for children infected with human immunodeficiency
 virus
(HIV) were developed by a working group convened by the National
 Pediatric
&amp; Family HIV Resource Center (1). These guidelines addressed the
 need for
prompt identification of infants born to HIV-infected women (i.e.,
HIV-exposed infants), measurement of such infants' CD4+
 T-lymphocyte counts
(CD4+ counts) and percentage of total lymphocytes (CD4+ percentage)
 first
upon identification and then serially thereafter, and initiation of
 PCP
prophylaxis based on age-associated CD4+ measurement values. In
 addition,
the guidelines recommended that all children who had had a previous
 episode
of PCP be maintained on prophylaxis, regardless of their CD4+
 measurement
values. </p>
<p>Since publication of these guidelines, additional data have
 been
collected that address a) the specificity and sensitivity of CD4+
 count
thresholds for indicating risk for PCP, b) changes in CD4+ counts
 preceding
an episode of PCP, c) correlation of CD4+ counts with CD4+
 percentages, d)
medications used for prophylaxis, and e) factors underlying the
 continued
incidence of PCP among children. In March 1994, the National
 Pediatric &amp;
Family HIV Resource Center, in collaboration with CDC, convened a
 working
group to review this new information and to reevaluate the 1991 PCP

prophylaxis guidelines for children. This report summarizes that
information and presents the group's recommendations for PCP
 prophylaxis
for children less than 13 years of age. </p>
<p>BACKGROUND </p>
<p>Identification of Children at Risk for PCP </p>
<p>Among children with perinatally acquired HIV infection, PCP
 occurs
most often in infants 3-6 months of age (2). PCP in infants (i.e.,
 children
less than 12 months of age) is often acute in onset and results in
 a poor
prognosis. Effective prevention of PCP among HIV-infected infants
 requires
that exposure to HIV be identified either before or immediately
 following
birth so that prophylaxis can be initiated before 2 months of age
 (the age
at which the risk for PCP begins to increase dramatically) (2). The
 recent
demonstration of the efficacy of zidovudine in lowering the rate of

perinatal HIV transmission emphasizes the importance of identifying

pregnant women with HIV infection as early as possible (3). Thus,
 through
prenatal HIV counseling and voluntary testing, pregnant women who
 are
infected with HIV can be offered interventions to a) maintain or
 improve
their own health, b) reduce the risk for transmitting HIV infection
 to
their children, and c) prevent PCP in their children if they also
 become
infected. </p>
<p>At present, however, many HIV-exposed children are not
 identified
early enough to be offered prophylaxis before the period of highest
 risk
for PCP. Studies have indicated that only 35%-55% of HIV-exposed
 children
have been identified by their health-care providers (4-6). A study
 of
HIV-infected children diagnosed with PCP in the United States
 during
1991-1993 indicated that 59% of the children who had not received
prophylaxis had not been identified as being at risk for HIV
 infection soon
enough for prophylaxis to be initiated (7). Failure to identify and

evaluate pregnant women with HIV infection and HIV-exposed children
 by
early infancy substantially limits the effectiveness of any PCP
 prophylaxis
strategy in preventing PCP among HIV-infected children. </p>
<p>CD4+ Count and PCP Among HIV-Infected Children </p>
<p>Data available when the 1991 prophylaxis guidelines were
 published
indicated that approximately 10% of children diagnosed with PCP at
 less
than 12 months of age had CD4+ counts of greater than or equal to
 1,500
cells/uL, the threshold for prophylaxis in this age group as
 defined in the
1991 guidelines. Recently published data, however, suggest that
 this
percentage may be even higher among HIV-infected infants diagnosed
 with PCP
at less than or equal to 6 months of age, the age at which most
 cases of
PCP occur (7-9). Moreover, CD4+ counts can drop rapidly in infants
 during
the few months preceding PCP diagnosis. For example, in one study
 of
children with PCP, 26% of children less than 6 months of age had
 CD4+
counts of greater than or equal to 1,500 cells/uL at the time of
 PCP
diagnosis (<a href="00037275.htm#00001115.htm">Table_1</a>) (7). In the same study, among 129 infants
 less than
1 year of age who had CD4+ counts measured before or at the time of
 PCP
diagnosis, the estimated decline of CD4+ counts during the 3 months

preceding the PCP diagnosis was 967 cells/uL (95% confidence
 interval=
724-1,210 cells/uL) (7). Because HIV-infected infants less than 1
 year of
age are at risk for PCP even with CD4+ counts of greater than or
 equal to
1,500 cells/uL and because these infants might have counts that
 drop to
this level or lower between measurements, the usefulness of CD4+
 counts in
determining the need for prophylaxis among infants in this age
 group is
limited. </p>
<p>Few data are available regarding CD4+ counts at the time of
 PCP
diagnosis for children greater than 1 year of age. In three
 previously
published studies of children who had PCP, one (5%) of 18 children
 1-5
years of age had a CD4+ count of greater than or equal to 500
 cells/uL, and
two (22%) of nine children 6-12 years of age had counts of greater
 than or
equal to 200 cells/uL (10-12). In a recent study, three (16%) of 19

children 1-5 years of age had CD4+ counts of greater than or equal
 to 500
cells/uL at the time of PCP diagnosis; each of these three children
 had
CD4+ counts that declined rapidly at approximately the time of PCP
diagnosis (<a href="00037275.htm#00001115.htm">Table_1</a>) (7). Also, all seven of the children
 greater than
or equal to 6 years of age who developed PCP had CD4+ counts of
 less than
200 cells/uL (<a href="00037275.htm#00001115.htm">Table_1</a>). </p>
<p>Correlation of CD4+ Counts with CD4+ Percentages </p>
<p>Measurements of CD4+ percentages may be subject to less
 variation than
those of CD4+ counts (13); thus, some clinicians prefer using CD4+
percentage to monitor immunosuppression in HIV-infected children.
 In the
1991 guidelines (1), the prophylaxis threshold of less than 20%
 that had
been recommended previously for adolescents and adults (14) was
 also
recommended for children. However, the potentially low sensitivity
 of this
threshold for the risk for PCP among young children was recognized.

Recently revised recommendations for PCP prophylaxis among
 adolescents and
adults no longer include CD4+ percentage as a criterion for
 prophylaxis
(15). </p>
<p>Data correlating CD4+ counts and percentages among
 HIV-infected
children have been collected since 1991. These data have been used
 to
develop a revised classification system for HIV infection among
 children
that utilizes both CD4+ counts and percentages to categorize
 children by
their level of immunosuppression (16) (<a href="00037275.htm#00001116.htm">Table_2</a>). Correlation of
 these
measurements has also allowed for determination of a CD4+
 percentage level
that is more indicative of severe immunosuppression in children. </p>
<p>Diagnosis of HIV Infection Among Children </p>
<p>HIV infection can be diagnosed among children greater than or
 equal to
18 months of age by using standard HIV IgG antibody tests. However,
 because
maternal IgG can be present in children less than 18 months of age,

standard HIV-IgG serologic assays cannot be used to diagnose HIV
 infection
in this age group. Advances in the development of viral detection
 assays,
however, have made diagnosing HIV infection possible in nearly all
 infants
by 4-6 months of age (17). The sensitivity of HIV culture or
 polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) among infants is less than or equal to 50%
 during the
first week after birth, but increases to greater than 90% by age 3
 months
and to nearly 100% by 6 months of age (17-20). The use of these
 assays has
been recommended for HIV-exposed children who are greater than or
 equal to
1 month of age (21) because results of these assays can be used to
 diagnose
HIV infection among infants (16). </p>
<p>Both the standard p24 antigen-capture assay and the
 immune-complex-
dissociated, p24 antigen-capture assay are highly specific and can
 be used
to diagnose HIV infection among infants (16). The sensitivity of
 the
standard p24 antigen-capture assay, however, is low (i.e., less
 than 50%)
in all age groups and therefore cannot be used to exclude HIV
 infection.
Modification of the p24 antigen-detection assay by pretreating
 serum
samples to dissociate antigen-antibody complexes has increased the
sensitivity of this assay (21,22). However, because data concerning
 the
sensitivity of this assay in early infancy are limited, use of this
 assay
alone is not currently recommended to exclude HIV infection. </p>
<p>RECOMMENDATIONS </p>
<p>The revised guidelines for PCP prophylaxis for children who
 are
infected with or perinatally exposed to HIV are based on similar
considerations as the 1991 guidelines, including the age
 distribution of
PCP among children, the rapid onset of PCP (especially among
 infants), the
high mortality rate associated with PCP, and data regarding CD4+
 counts and
percentages among HIV-infected children. Based on these
 considerations and
more recent data, the following guidelines are recommended for PCP
prophylaxis among children less than 13 years of age. </p>
<p>Identifying Infants at Risk for HIV Infection </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Infants born to HIV-infected women should be identified
 promptly so
    that prophylaxis can be initiated before these infants are at
 risk for
    PCP. Diagnosing HIV infection among women before or during
 pregnancy
    is the most beneficial way to accomplish this goal. Early
 diagnosis
    not only allows for prompt evaluation of the need for PCP
 prophylaxis
    among the infants of HIV-infected women, but also gives such
 women the
    opportunity to access interventions that could a) maintain or
 improve
    their own health status and b) reduce the risk for
 transmitting HIV
    infection to their children (e.g., through antiretroviral
 therapy and
    avoidance of breastfeeding). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    If maternal HIV infection is not identified prenatally,
 pediatric
    health-care providers should identify infants born to
 HIV-infected
    women as soon as possible after birth so that PCP prophylaxis
 can
    begin promptly. Availability of and access to health care for
 both
    HIV-infected women and their newborns are essential to the
    implementation of an effective PCP prophylaxis strategy. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Diagnostic and Immunologic Monitoring of HIV-Exposed Infants </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    All infants born to HIV-infected women should be monitored to
    determine their HIV infection status; the use of HIV culture
 or PCR is
    the preferred method for diagnosing HIV infection among
 infants (21).
    These assays should be performed at least twice: once at less
 than or
    equal to 1 month of age and once at less than or equal to 4
 months of
    age. If the result of any test is positive, testing should be
 repeated
    to confirm diagnosis of HIV infection. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Although the use of CD4+ counts and percentages is no longer
    recommended for determining the need for PCP prophylaxis among

    HIV-exposed infants less than 1 year of age (see Initiating
 PCP
    Prophylaxis Among HIV-Exposed Infants), other clinical
 considerations
    for such infants rely on these measurements. These include the

    assessment of such infants' immune status, risk for disease
    progression, and need for continued PCP prophylaxis after 1
 year of
    age (see PCP Prophylaxis for HIV-Infected Children less than
 or equal
    to 12 Months of Age). Therefore, CD4+ counts and percentages
 should be
    measured in all HIV-exposed infants at 1 and 3 months of age
    (<a href="00037275.htm#00001117.htm">Table_3</a>). CD4+ monitoring is not necessary after HIV
 infection
    has been reasonably excluded (see PCP Prophylaxis for Infants
 4-12
    Months of Age). For infants who have been diagnosed as
 HIV-infected
    and for those whose infection status has not yet been
 determined, CD4+
    values should be monitored at 6, 9, and 12 months of age. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Initiating PCP Prophylaxis Among HIV-Exposed Infants </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    All infants born to HIV-infected women should be started on
 PCP
    prophylaxis at 4-6 weeks of age, regardless of their CD4+
 count
    (<a href="00037275.htm#00001117.htm">Table_3</a>). Infants who are first identified as being
 HIV-exposed
    after 6 weeks of age should be started on prophylaxis at the
 time of
    identification. These recommendations are based on the
 following
    considerations: a) most cases of PCP among HIV-infected
 children occur
    in the first year of life; b) the risk for PCP begins to
 increase
    dramatically at age 2 months (when HIV infection cannot yet be

    reasonably excluded) (see PCP Prophylaxis For Infants 4-12
 Months of
    Age); and c) the reliability of CD4+ counts in predicting
 which
    infants are at risk for PCP is relatively low during infancy
    particularly among infants less than or equal to 6 months of
 age, the
    age at which the peak incidence of PCP occurs. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>PCP prophylaxis should not be administered to infants less
 than 4
weeks of age because a) they are at low risk for PCP and b)
 the use of
sulfa drugs among infants at this age is not advised because
 of the
potential for adverse drug effects resulting from immature
 bilirubin
metabolism. Additionally, the concurrent use of sulfa drugs
 among
HIV-exposed infants who are receiving zidovudine during the
 first 6
weeks of life to prevent perinatal HIV transmission could
 potentially
exacerbate the anemia that some children receiving zidovudine
experience (3). Therefore, to avoid the potential for
 additional
toxicity in such children, prophylaxis should be started at 6
 weeks of
age, the age at which zidovudine is discontinued. </p>
<p>PCP Prophylaxis for Infants 4-12 Months of Age </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    All HIV-infected infants and infants whose infection status
 has not
    yet been determined should continue prophylaxis until 12
 months of
    age. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    PCP prophylaxis should be discontinued among infants in whom
 HIV
    infection has been reasonably excluded on the basis of two or
 more
    negative viral diagnostic tests (i.e., HIV culture or PCR),
 both of
    which are performed at greater than or equal to 1 month of age
 and one
    of which is performed at greater than or equal to 4 months of
 age. In
    some clinical centers, these viral diagnostic tests are not
 available.
    For children who do not have access to such testing,
 prophylaxis
    should be continued until 12 months of age unless HIV
 infection has
    been excluded on the basis of two or more negative HIV-
 antibody tests
    performed at greater than or equal to 6 months of age (16). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>PCP Prophylaxis for HIV-Infected Children greater than or equal to
 12
Months of Age </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    All HIV-infected children greater than or equal to 12 months
 of age
    should continue to have regular CD4+ monitoring to determine
 their
    need for PCP prophylaxis (<a href="00037275.htm#00001117.htm">Table_3</a>). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    HIV-infected children and children whose infection status has
 not been
    determined should be evaluated at 12 months of age to
 determine their
    need for continued PCP prophylaxis. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>PCP prophylaxis should be continued after 12 months of age for

HIV-infected children who have had any CD4+ measurement during
 the
first 12 months of life indicating severe immunosuppression
 (i.e., a
CD4+ count of less than 750 cells/uL or a CD4+ percentage of
 less than
15%). Prophylaxis should be discontinued at 12 months of age
 for
HIV-infected children whose CD4+ measurements have been
 adequately
monitored (<a href="00037275.htm#00001117.htm">Table_3</a>) and have remained higher than these
 levels.
PCP prophylaxis should also be discontinued for any child who
 is
diagnosed as not being infected with HIV (16). </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Children who have received PCP prophylaxis from 12 to 24
 months of age
    should be evaluated again at 24 months of age, and prophylaxis
 should
    be continued for those children who have had any CD4+
 measurement
    indicating severe immunosuppression (i.e., a CD4+ count of
 less than
    500 cells/uL or a CD4+ percentage of less than 15%).
 Prophylaxis
    should be discontinued at 24 months of age for HIV-infected
 children
    whose CD4+ measurements have been adequately monitored
 (<a href="00037275.htm#00001117.htm">Table_3</a>)
    and have remained higher than these levels. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    HIV-infected children greater than or equal to 12 months of
 age who
    are not receiving prophylaxis (e.g., those children whose
 infection
    was not identified previously or whose PCP prophylaxis was
    discontinued) should begin PCP prophylaxis if their CD4+
 measurement
    indicates severe immunosuppression (<a href="00037275.htm#00001116.htm">Table_2</a>). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Initiation or continuation of prophylaxis should also be
 considered on
    a case-by-case basis for HIV-infected children greater than or
 equal
    to 12 months of age who might otherwise be at risk for PCP,
 such as
    children with rapidly declining CD4+ counts or percentages or
 children
    with severely symptomatic HIV disease (i.e., Category C
 conditions
    {16}). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Prophylaxis Against PCP Recurrence </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    HIV-infected children who have had an episode of PCP should
 receive
    lifelong PCP prophylaxis to prevent recurrence -- regardless
 of CD4+
    measurement or clinical status. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Recommended Chemoprophylaxis Regimens </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    The recommended PCP chemoprophylaxis regimen for children is
    trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole(TMP-SMX) (Box 1 <a href="00037275.htm#00001118.htm">Table_B1</a>).
 When
    initiating TMP-SMX prophylaxis, a baseline complete blood
 count,
    differential count, and platelet count should be obtained.
 These
    measurements should be repeated monthly while the child is
 receiving
    prophylaxis. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If TMP-SMX is not tolerated, alternative regimens should be
 followed.
On the basis of recently compiled pharmacokinetics data, the
 revised
recommended dosage of dapsone as an alternative regimen is 2
mg/kg/day. These data indicate that peak serum concentrations
 for
children receiving chronic dosing of dapsone at 1 mg/kg/dose
 average
1.84 ug/mL, compared with average peak concentrations of 4.65
 ug/mL
for adults receiving the standard dose of 100 mg/day (23,24).
 The
increased dose of dapsone is recommended so that peak
 concentrations
will approach concentrations achieved at dosages recommended
 for
adults (15). </p>
<p>PCP prophylaxis is an approved labeling indication by the U.S.
 Food
and Drug Administration for oral TMP-SMX but not for the
 various other
alternative regimens for PCP prophylaxis. </p>
<p>TMP-SMX has been shown to substantially reduce the risk for
 PCP among
HIV-infected children (25). However, clinicians should be
 aware that
some children have developed PCP despite the use of
 recommended
prophylaxis (26). </p>
<p>Education and Counseling </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Providing HIV counseling and voluntary testing to all pregnant
 women
    and providing comprehensive pediatric care for infants born to

    HIV-infected women are likely to be the most effective steps
 toward
    preventing PCP in children. The U.S. Public Health Service is
    recommending voluntary HIV counseling and testing of all
 pregnant
    women because of the prevention opportunities these services
 provide
    for women and their infants (27). For uninfected women, such
    counseling is intended to initiate or reinforce HIV
 risk-reduction
    behavior. For infected women, knowledge of their HIV infection
 status
    allows for more informed reproductive decisions, opportunities
 to
    reduce the risk for perinatal HIV transmission, and early
 diagnosis
    and treatment for themselves and their HIV-exposed infants.
 Early
    identification of HIV-exposed infants also allows for
 education of
    parents or other caregivers regarding treatment
 considerations,
    including PCP prophylaxis. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    An optimal PCP prophylaxis strategy requires consistent
 adherence to
    the chemoprophylaxis regimen by the child's parent or other
 caregiver.
    Such adherence is likely to be enhanced if the caregiver is
    knowledgeable about PCP and its prevention. Therefore, parents
 and
    other caregivers of HIV-exposed children should be provided
    information that addresses </p>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li><p>
        how HIV infection is diagnosed among infants, including
 types and
        sensitivities of available tests; </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        the relatively high risk for PCP among young infants; </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        the frequently sudden onset and high mortality of PCP
 among
        infants; </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        drug regimens for PCP chemoprophylaxis, including
 efficacy and
        the frequency and nature of potential adverse effects; </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        the importance of starting prophylaxis in all HIV-exposed
 infants
        at 4-6 weeks of age, even when the diagnosis of HIV
 infection has
        not been established; and </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        the rationale for having different prophylaxis strategies
 for
        adults and children. </p>
        <p>Additionally, health-care providers should review the various
        acceptable alternative dosing schedules with the child's
 caregiver and
        make every effort to tailor the dosing regimen to fit the
 caregiver's
        schedule. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>FUTURE NEEDS </p>
</ul>
<p>These recommendations were developed on the basis of currently

available data. Other strategies for prophylaxis might need to be
considered in the future. Factors that might influence the need to
 modify
these guidelines include the extent to which a) the incidence of
 PCP
decreases following implementation of these recommendations and
 those for
HIV counseling and testing of pregnant women; b) improvements in
 the
sensitivity and availability of HIV diagnostic tests allow for
 diagnosis
and exclusion of HIV infection in most HIV-exposed infants before
 the age
of greatest risk for PCP; and c) reduction in mother-to-infant HIV
transmission through zidovudine therapy results in an increased
 number of
HIV-exposed but uninfected infants receiving PCP prophylaxis. </p>

                                       CD4+ count is &lt;500 cells/uL or
                                       CD4+ percentage is &lt;15% &amp;@

6-12 yrs, HIV infected               Prophylaxis if:                      Every 3-4 mos +
                                       CD4+ count is &lt;200 cells/uL or
                                       CD4+ percentage is &lt;15% @
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HIV infection can be reasonably excluded among children who have had two or more negative
  HIV diagnostic tests (i.e., HIV culture or PCR), both of which are performed at &gt;=1 month of age
  and one of which is performed at &gt;=4 months of age, or two or more negative HIV IgG antibody
  tests performed at &gt;6 months of age among children who have no clinical evidence of HIV
  disease.
+ More frequent monitoring (e.g., monthly) is recommended for children whose CD4+ counts
  or percentages are approaching the threshold at which prophylaxis is recommended.
&amp; Children 1-2 years of age who were receiving PCP prophylaxis and had a CD4+ count of
  &lt;750 cells/uL or percentage of &lt;15% at &lt;12 months of age should continue prophylaxis.
@ Prophylaxis should be considered on a case-by-case basis for children who might otherwise
  be at risk for PCP, such as children with rapidly declining CD4+ counts or percentages or
  children with Category C conditions (16). Children who have had PCP should receive lifelong
  PCP prophylaxis.

BOX 1. Drug regimens for PCP prophylaxis for children &gt;=4 weeks of age
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recommended regimen:
  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) 150 mg TMP/M(2)/day with 750 mg
  SMX/M(2)/day administered orally in divided doses twice a day (b.i.d.) 3 times
  per week on consecutive days (e.g., Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday).

  Acceptable alternative TMP-SMX dosage schedules:

  -- 150 mg TMP/M(2)/day with 750 mg SMX/M(2)/day administered orally as a
     single daily dose 3 times per week on consecutive days (e.g., Monday-
     Tuesday-Wednesday).

  -- 150 mg TMP/M(2)/day with 750 mg SMX/M(2)/day orally divided b.i.d. and
     administered 7 days per week.

  -- 150 mg TMP/M(2)/day with 750 mg SMX/M(2)/day administered orally di-
     vided b.i.d. and administered 3 times per week on alternate days (e.g.,
     Monday-Wednesday-Friday).

Alternative regimens if TMP-SMX is not tolerated:

-- Dapsone *

   2 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) administered orally once daily.

-- Aerosolized pentamidine* (children &gt;=5 years of age)

   300 mg administered via Respirgard II inhaler monthly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* If neither dapsone nor aerosolized pentamidine is tolerated, some clinicians use intravenous
  pentamidine (4 mg/kg) administered every 2 or 4 weeks.
