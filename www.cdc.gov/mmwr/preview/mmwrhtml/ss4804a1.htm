</i><b><p>Abstract</p>
</b>
<p>     <b>Problem/Condition: </b>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions, to monitor unintended pregnancy, and to assist efforts to identify and reduce preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with abortions.</p>
<p>     <b>Reporting Period Covered:</b> This report summarizes and reviews information reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the United States in 1996. This report also includes recently reported abortion-related deaths that occurred in 1992.</p>
<p>     <b>Description of System: </b>For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled abortion data received from 52 reporting areas in the United States: 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City.</p>
<p>     <b>Results:</b> In 1996, a total of 1,221,585 legal abortions were reported to CDC, representing a 0.9% increase from the number reported for 1995. The abortion ratio was 314 legal induced abortions per 1,000 live births, and as in 1995, the abortion rate was 20 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years. Women who were undergoing an abortion were more likely to be young (i.e. aged less than 25 years), white, and unmarried; most were obtaining an abortion for the first time. More than one half of all abortions (55%) were performed at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation, and approximately 88% were performed before 13 weeks. Approximately 16% of abortions were performed at the earliest weeks of gestation (less than or equal to 6 weeks), approximately 17% at 7 weeks of gestation, and approximately 21% at 8 weeks of gestation. Few abortions were provided after 15 weeks of gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were obtained at 16-20 weeks, and 1.5% were obtained at greater than or equal to 21 weeks. Younger women (i.e., women aged less than or equal to 24 years) were more likely to obtain abortions later in pregnancy than were older women.</p>
<p>     In 1992, 10 women died as a result of complications from legal induced abortion, and no deaths were reported associated with illegal abortion. In 1992, the case-fatality rate of legal induced abortion was 0.7 abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions.</p>
<p>     <b>Interpretation:</b> From 1990 through 1995, the number of abortions declined each year; in 1996, the number of abortions in the United States stabilized. As in previous years, deaths related to legal induced abortions occurred rarely (i.e., approximately one death per 100,000 legal induced abortions).</p>
<p>     <b>Actions Taken:</b> The number and characteristics of women who obtain abortions in the United States should continue to be monitored so that trends in induced abortion can be assessed, efforts to prevent unintended pregnancy can be evaluated, and the preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with abortions can be identified and reduced.</p>

<b><p>INTRODUCTION</p>
</b>
<p>     In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions, to monitor unintended pregnancy, and to assist efforts to identify and reduce preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with abortions. This report is based on abortion data for 1996 provided to CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP), Division of Reproductive Health.</p>

<b><p>METHODS</p>
</b>
<p>     For 1996, CDC compiled data from 52 reporting areas in the United States: 50 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City. Legal induced abortion was defined as a procedure, performed by a licensed physician or someone acting under the supervision of a licensed physician, that was intended to terminate a suspected or known intrauterine pregnancy and to produce a nonviable fetus at any gestational age (1,2). The total number of legal induced abortions was available from all reporting areas; however, not all of these areas collected information regarding the characteristics of women who obtained abortions.</p>
<p>     The availability of information about characteristics of women who obtained an abortion in 1996 varied by state. Most reporting areas (44 states and New York City) collected and reported adequate abortion data (i.e., data of sufficient quality to be used for analysis) by age of the woman, whereas only 22 states and New York City collected and reported adequate abortion data by Hispanic ethnicity. In the &quot;Results&quot; section of this report, all of the percentage data for each characteristic represent only women with known characteristics; unknowns have not been distributed for the calculation of these percentages (Tables 4, 6-13). Areas were excluded from the analysis if data regarding a given characteristic were unknown for greater than 15% of women (Tables 1, 4-18).</p>
<p>     For 48 reporting areas, data concerning the number and characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions were provided by the central health agency*; for the other four areas, data were provided by hospitals and other medical facilities (3). Because information concerning the residence of women who obtained abortions was not available from some states, the procedures were reported by the state in which they were performed. However, for two reporting areas (i.e., the District of Columbia and Wisconsin), characteristics of women who were nonresidents and who obtained abortions in 1996 were unavailable.</p>
<p>     For analysis by age, women who obtained legal induced abortions were grouped by 5-year age groups. Both ratios (i.e., the number of abortions per 1,000 live births per year) and rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women per year) are presented by age group in this report. Starting with 1996, ratios were calculated by using the number of live births to residents of each area reported to CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, and rates were calculated by using the number of women residents of each area reported in special unpublished tabulations provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Because almost all (94%) abortions among women aged less than 15 years in 1988 (4) occurred among those aged 13-14 years, the population of women aged 13-14 years was used as the denominator for calculating abortion rates for women aged less than 15 years. Rates for women aged greater than or equal to 40 years were based on the number of women aged 40-44 years, whereas rates for all women who obtained abortions were based on the population of women aged 15-44 years.</p>
<p>     Race was categorized by three groups (i.e., a] white, b] black, and c] all other races) or two groups (i.e., a] white and b] black and all other races). &quot;Other&quot; races included Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and women classified as &quot;other&quot; race. As in previous reports, Hispanic ethnicity and race were evaluated separately, and rates and ratios were presented by both race and Hispanic ethnicity.</p>
<p>     Marital status was reported as either married (which included women who were married or separated) or unmarried (which included those who were never married, divorced, or widowed, except where noted). Reporting of marital status differed somewhat by state, particularly for the data used as denominators to calculate abortion ratios by marital status; therefore, abortion ratios by marital status should be interpreted cautiously.</p>
<p>     Most areas (37 of 40) that reported adequate data on week of gestation at the time of abortion also reported abortions performed at less than or equal to 6, 7, and 8 weeks of gestation. Gestational age (in weeks) at the time of abortion was reported by approximately one half of the areas from estimates derived from the time elapsed since the woman's last menstrual period. In 1996, for 18 other states, gestational age was reported on the basis of the physician's estimate for each reported abortion or when information regarding the last menstrual period was missing or unreliable. Physician's estimates for gestational age also could have included information from the clinical examination as well as the time elapsed since the last menstrual period.</p>
<p>     CDC has periodically reported information on abortion-related deaths; 1972 was the first year for which such data were available (5). Sources for such information included national and state vital records, maternal mortality review committees, surveys, private citizens, the media, health-care providers, medical examiners' reports, and, more recently, computerized searches of several full-text newspaper databases. For each reported case, clinical records and autopsy reports were requested and reviewed by two medical epidemiologists to determine the cause of death and verify that the death was abortion-related.</p>
<p>     An abortion-related death was defined as a death resulting from a) a direct complication of an abortion, b) an indirect complication caused by the chain of events initiated by the abortion, or c) aggravation of a preexisting condition by the physiologic or psychologic effects of the abortion (2). Each abortion-related death was then categorized as legal induced, illegal induced, spontaneous, or unknown. Deaths that did not satisfy the criteria of the case definition were classified as not abortion-related.**</p>
<p>     This report includes reported abortion-related deaths that occurred in 1992. National case-fatality rates were calculated as the number of legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions. Trends in case-fatality rates for legal induced abortions during 1972-1992 are reported.</p>

<b><p>RESULTS</p>
</b>
<p>     In 1996, a total of 1,221,585 legal induced abortions were reported to CDC, representing a slight increase of 0.9% from the number reported for 1995 (6) (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). From 1970 through 1982, the reported number of legal abortions in the United States increased every year (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>); the largest percentage increase occurred from 1970 to 1971. From 1976 through 1982, the annual increase declined and reached a low of 0.2% during 1980-1981 and during 1981-1982. From 1983 through 1990, the number of abortions increased again, although moderately (less than or equal to 5% from year to year). However, despite the slight increase in the number of abortions in 1996 compared with 1995, during 1990-1995, the annual number of abortions decreased each year.</p>
<p>     The national legal induced abortion ratio (number of legal abortions per 1,000 live births) increased from 1970 through 1980, peaked at 364 per 1,000 live births in 1984, and began to decline steadily in 1987, from 356 per 1,000 to 311 per 1,000 in 1995 (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). From 1995 to 1996, the national abortion ratio increased slightly, from 311 to 314. The national legal induced abortion rate increased from five abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years in 1970 to 25 per 1,000 in 1980. From 1981 through 1992, the rate remained stable at 23-24 abortions per 1,000 women, then declined to 22 in 1993, to 21 in 1994, and to 20 in 1995. In 1996, the abortion rate remained stable at 20 abortions per 1,000 women.</p>
<p>     In 1996, as in previous years, most legal induced abortions were performed in California, New York City, Texas, and Florida; the fewest were performed in Wyoming, South Dakota, Idaho, and North Dakota (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>) (6). For women whose state of residence was known, approximately 92% had obtained the abortion within the state in which they resided. The percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents ranged from approximately 50% in the District of Columbia to less than 0.5% in Hawaii. For 1996, eight reporting areas could not provide data concerning abortions obtained by out-of-state residents.</p>
<p>     Women aged 20-24 years obtained approximately one third (32%) of all abortions; women aged less than 15 years obtained less than 1% of all abortions (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>). Abortion ratios were highest for the youngest women (i.e., 723 abortions per 1,000 live births for women aged less than 15 years and 415 per 1,000 for women aged 15-19 years) and for the oldest women (376 per 1,000 live births for women aged 40-44 years). The ratio was lowest for women aged 30-34 years (165 per 1,000 live births) (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>). Among adolescents, the abortion ratio was highest for those aged less than 15 years and lowest for those aged 19 years (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab5">Table 5</a>).</p>
<p>     In contrast to abortion ratios, abortion rates were highest for women aged 20-24 years (38 abortions per 1,000 women) and lowest for women at the extremes of reproductive-age (i.e., two abortions per 1,000 women aged less than 15 years [i.e., 13-14 years] and two per 1,000 women aged 40-44 years) (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>).</p>
<p>     For women in most age groups, the abortion ratio increased from 1974 through the early 1980s and declined thereafter, particularly for the youngest and oldest reproductive-aged women (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Abortion ratios for women aged less than 15 years have been and remain higher than those for the other age groups. Although abortion ratios increased slightly for women aged less than 15 and 15-19 years from 1995 to 1996, these ratios remained among the lowest ever recorded for these age groups. The abortion ratio for women aged 20-34 years (i.e., the group with the highest fertility rate) (7) has remained stable since the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>     In 1996, approximately 54% of reported legal induced abortions were obtained at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation, and approximately 87% at less than 13 weeks (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab6">Table 6</a>). Approximately 16% of abortions were performed during the earliest weeks of gestation (less than or equal to 6 weeks), approximately 17% at 7 weeks, and approximately 21% at 8 weeks (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab7">Table 7</a>). Few abortions were provided after 15 weeks of gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were obtained at 16-20 weeks, and 1.5% were obtained at greater than or equal to 21 weeks (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig4">Figure 4</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab6">Table 6</a>).</p>
<p>     Almost all (98%) abortions were performed by curettage and less than 0.5% by intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab8">Table 8</a>). Hysterectomy and hysterotomy were used in fewer than 0.01% of abortions.</p>
<p>     Approximately 57% of women who obtained legal induced abortions were white (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab9">Table 9</a>). The abortion ratio for black women was 555 per 1,000 live births; this was approximately 2.7 times the ratio for white women (202 per 1,000 live births). The abortion ratio for women of other races (360 per 1,000 live births) was approximately 1.8 times the ratio for white women. In addition, the abortion rate for black women (31 per 1,000 women) was approximately 2.6 times the rate for white women (12 per 1,000 women).</p>
<p>     Twenty-two states and New York City*** reported data concerning the Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained legal induced abortions (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab10">Table 10</a>). The percentage of abortions obtained by Hispanic women in these reporting areas ranged from less than 1% in several states to approximately 44% in New Mexico. For Hispanic women in these reporting areas, the abortion ratio was 276 per 1,000 live births -- slightly lower than the ratio for non-Hispanics in the same areas (282 per 1,000 live births). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women (20 per 1,000 women) was greater than the rate per 1,000 non-Hispanic women (15 per 1,000 women).</p>
<p>     Seventy-eight percent of women who obtained abortions were unmarried (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab11">Table 11</a>). The abortion ratio for unmarried women was approximately eight times the ratio for married women (655 versus 78 abortions per 1,000 live births).</p>
<p>     Approximately 43% of women who obtained legal induced abortions had had no previous live births, and approximately 87% had had two or fewer previous live births (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab12">Table 12</a>). The abortion ratio was highest for women who had had three previous live births and lowest for women who had had one previous live birth.</p>
<p>     In 1996, of women who obtained an abortion, 54% of women obtained an abortion for the first time. Approximately 18% of women had had at least two previous abortions (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab13">Table 13</a>).</p>
<p>     The age distribution of women who obtained a legal abortion differed slightly by race (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab14">Table 14</a>). However, for women of black or other races, the percentage who were aged less than 15 years, although small (1.0%), was almost twice the percentage for white women (0.6%). The percentage of women of black or other races who were unmarried (83%) also was slightly higher than the percentage of white women (77%). Few differences were found by age and Hispanic ethnicity (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab15">Table 15</a>). Of those women who had obtained an abortion, a slightly higher percentage of non-Hispanic women were unmarried (80%) in comparison with Hispanic women (77%).</p>
<p>     Most (approximately 88%) women who obtained an abortion had their procedure during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab16">Table 16</a> and <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab17">Table 17</a>). The percentage of women who obtained an abortion early in pregnancy (i.e., less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation) increased with age, and the percentage who obtained an abortion very late in pregnancy (at greater than or equal to 21 weeks of gestation) decreased with age for women up to 30-34 years of age and remained stable for women in older age groups (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig5">Figure 5</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab16">Table 16</a>). Black women were more likely to obtain an abortion later in pregnancy than were white women or women of other races (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab16">Table 16</a> and <a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab17">Table 17</a>). Of all women who obtained an abortion, Hispanic women were slightly more likely than non-Hispanic women to have had an abortion at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation and less likely to have had an abortion late in pregnancy (greater than or equal to 21 weeks). However, the overall differences between Hispanic and non-Hispanic women in the timing of abortions were minimal (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab16">Table 16</a>).</p>
<p>     More than 99% of abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks of gestation were performed by using curettage (primarily suction procedures) (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab18">Table 18</a>). After 12 weeks of gestation, the most frequently used procedure also was curettage, although it usually was performed as a dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Intrauterine instillations involved the use of saline or prostaglandin; these procedures were used primarily at greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation.</p>
<p>     CDC received reports of 43 possible abortion-related deaths for 1992 (the most recent year for which data are available). A review of these cases indicated that 27 of the 43 women died of abortion-related causes (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab19">Table 19</a>). Ten of the deaths were associated with legal induced abortion, and 17 deaths were associated with spontaneous abortions. No deaths were associated with illegal induced abortions. Possible abortion-related deaths that occurred during 1993-1996 are being investigated.</p>
<p>     The case-fatality rate for legal induced abortion in 1992 was 0.7 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions. During 1980-1992, annual case-fatality rates for legal induced abortion-related deaths were less than or equal to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab19">Table 19</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig6">Figure 6</a>).</p>

<b><p>DISCUSSION</p>
</b>
<p>     From 1990 (i.e., the year in which the number of abortions was highest) through 1995, the annual number of abortions in the United States decreased by 15% (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>) (6,8). From 1995 to 1996, the number of abortions differed only slightly (an increase of 0.9%). Therefore, in 1996, the number of abortions in this country appears to have stabilized. In addition, the number of live births in 1996 was also stable from that recorded for 1995, a decrease of 0.2% (7).</p>
<p>     The abortion ratio had increased steadily from 1970 through 1980, decreased slightly during 1980-1983, increased to its highest level in 1984, remained fairly stable until 1987, and then declined each subsequent year through 1995 (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>; <a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Despite a slight increase in the abortion ratio from 1995 to 1996 (from 311 to 314 abortions per 1,000 live births), the ratio for these 2 years were at the lowest recorded level since 1976 (6,9). The slight ratio increase in 1996 occurred because the numerator of this ratio (the number of abortions) increased slightly, and the denominator (the number of live births) decreased slightly for that year (7).</p>
<p>     In both 1995 and 1996, the national abortion rate was 20 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44, the lowest recorded rate since 1975 (10). This trend in the abortion rate might reflect multiple factors, including the decreasing number of unintended pregnancies; a shift in the age distribution of reproductive-aged women towards the older and less fertile ages; reduced access to abortion services; and changes in contraceptive practices, including an increased use of contraception, particularly an increased use of condoms among young women (6, 11-14). In this report, the induced abortion rate in the United States was higher than recent rates reported for Australia, Canada, and Western European countries and lower than rates reported for China, Cuba, most Eastern European countries, and several of the Newly Independent States of the former Soviet Union (15,16). Abortion and birth rates for teenagers are higher in the United States than in most Western European countries and some Eastern European countries (17).</p>
<p>     As in previous years, the abortion ratio in 1996 varied substantially by age (6). Although the ratio was highest for adolescents, the percentage of legal induced abortions obtained by women aged less than or equal to 19 years has decreased since the mid-1980s (i.e., from 26% in 1984 to 22% in 1990 and to 20% in 1992) and has remained at that level (8,18). From 1984 through 1995, the abortion ratio declined for women aged 15-19 years to the lowest abortion ratio ever recorded for that age group (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). In 1996, the ratio for this group rose slightly. Other studies have indicated a decrease in pregnancy rates for women aged 15-19 years from 1992 through 1995 and a decrease in teenage birth rates from 1995 to 1996 (7,19).</p>
<p>     Several factors might have influenced this decline over time in the abortion ratios among adolescents. First, teenage pregnancies decreased and the decline in abortions was even greater than for live births. Second, the age distribution of reproductive-aged women obtaining abortions shifted from younger women to older women (20). Third, access to abortion services changed (12,13), including the passage of abortion laws that affect adolescents (e.g., parental consent or notification laws and mandatory waiting periods) (21,22).</p>
<p>     In 1996, as in 1995, the abortion ratio for black women was more than two and one half times (2.8) the ratio for white women; this differential has increased since 1989 (23). In addition, the abortion rate for black women was approximately 2.7 times the rate for white women. Race-specific differences in legal induced abortion ratios and rates might reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status, contraceptive use, incidence of unintended pregnancies, and access to family-planning and contraceptive services.</p>
<p>     The abortion-to-live-birth ratio for Hispanic women during 1996 was slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic women. Another report, which describes characteristics of women who obtain abortions supports this finding (24). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women was higher than the rate for non-Hispanic women, which is consistent with several other studies (24,25). For women in all age groups, fertility was substantially higher for Hispanic than for non-Hispanic women (7).</p>
<p>     In 1996, a total of 38 areas, including the District of Columbia and New York City, reported Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained abortions. Because of concerns regarding the completeness of such information (greater than 15% unknown data) for Hispanic ethnicity in some states, data from only 22 states and New York City were evaluated to determine the number and percentage of abortions obtained by women of Hispanic ethnicity in 1996. These geographical areas represent approximately 34% of all reproductive-aged Hispanic women in the United States in 1996 (CDC, unpublished data). Thus, the number of Hispanic women who obtain abortions might be underestimated (24), and the number, ratio, and rate of abortions for Hispanic women in this report might not be representative of the overall Hispanic population in the United States (i.e., these data might reflect utilization of abortion services only in the areas included in this analysis).</p>
<p>     Since 1980, the percentage distribution of abortions by gestational age has been stable, with slight percentage increases toward the earliest and latest gestational ages. Since 1992, there have been slight percentage decreases for abortions performed at 8 and 9-10 weeks and increases in the percentage of abortions performed at the early weeks of gestation (i.e., less than or equal to 6 and 7 weeks). Recently, interest has increased in surveillance for abortions performed late in pregnancy (i.e., greater than or equal to 21 weeks) (26,27).</p>
<p>     Data are compiled and reported to assist in monitoring trends in legal abortions as new medical (nonsurgical) methods of terminating pregnancy are implemented because these new methods are used primarily to terminate pregnancies at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation (28-30). Since 1992, most reporting areas have reported abortions by gestational age, in weeks of gestation, for abortions performed at less than or equal to 6, 7, and 8 weeks. For 1997, most states are expected to collect and report data on abortions performed by medical (nonsurgical) procedures (31). During 1994-1995, approximately 2,000 women in the United States aged greater than 18 years participated in clinical trials testing mifepristone, a medication used for medical (nonsurgical) abortion (32). This medication has not yet been fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use and distribution in the United States (Population Council, Personal Communication, 1999). However, other medications (e.g., methotrexate and misoprostol) are currently being used to perform early medical (nonsurgical) abortions (30,33).</p>
<p>     In this and previous reports, age was inversely associated with timing of abortion (6). As in previous years, younger women were more likely to obtain an abortion later in gestation than were older women. In addition to the age of the woman, marital status, level of education, availability and accessibility of services, timing of confirmation of pregnancy, personal decision-making, level of fear and denial of pregnancy, and other considerations impact the timing of abortion (34,35).</p>
<p>     From 1972 through 1996, the percentage of abortions performed by curettage (which includes D&amp;E) increased from 89% to 99% (<a href="ss4804a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>), and the percentage of abortions performed by intrauterine instillation and hysterectomy and hysterotomy declined sharply (from 10% to 0.4% and from 0.6% to less than 0.01%, respectively [5]). From 1974 through 1996, the percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by D&amp;E (curettage) increased from 31% to 93%; the percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by intrauterine instillation decreased from 57% to 2% (36). The continued reliance on D&amp;E probably has resulted from the lower risk for complications associated with the procedure (37,38).</p>
<p>     From 1972 through 1992, the annual number of deaths associated with legal induced abortion has decreased by 58% (5). In 1972, 24 women died from causes associated with legal abortion, and 39 women died from illegal abortions (5). In 1992, 10 women died as a result of legal induced abortion, and none died as a result of illegal abortion. The case-fatality rate decreased by 82% between 1972 and 1992. These rates, consistent with previously published data for the 1970s and mid-1980s, indicate that the risk for death from legal induced abortion continues to be extremely low (39-42).</p>
<p>     In 1992, 17 reported deaths were associated with spontaneous abortion. This number was greater than in previous years; spontaneous abortion-related deaths have been relatively stable at less than 10 deaths per year since 1978. The reason for this increase in reported spontaneous abortion-related deaths is unclear at this time and is under investigation.</p>
<p>     The number, ratio, and rate of abortions from this analysis are conservative estimates because the numbers of legal abortions reported to CDC for 1996 were probably lower than the numbers actually performed. Totals provided by central health agencies might be lower than those obtained by direct surveys of abortion providers (3). For example, the total number of abortions reported to CDC for 1996 was approximately 12% lower than that reported for 1996 by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private organization that directly contacts abortion providers to obtain information concerning the total number of abortions performed (13). In addition, not all states collected and/or reported information (e.g., age, race, and gestational age) concerning women obtaining a legal induced abortion in 1996; therefore, the numbers, percentages, rates, and ratios derived from this analysis might not be representative of all women who obtained abortions in that year.</p>
<p>     Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national surveillance for legal induced abortion are useful for several purposes. First, public health agencies use data from abortion surveillance that characterize women who are at high risk for unintended pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance is used to monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of abortions in the United States. Third, statistics on the number of pregnancies ending in abortion are used in conjunction with birth and fetal death statistics to estimate pregnancy rates (e.g., pregnancy rates among teenagers) (4) and other outcome rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic pregnancies per 1,000 pregnancies). Fourth, abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of family-planning programs and programs for preventing unintended pregnancy. Fifth, ongoing surveillance provides data for assessing changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion (e.g., longitudinal changes in the types of procedures and trends in gestational age at the time of abortion). Finally, abortion data are used as the denominator in calculating abortion morbidity and mortality rates.</p>
<p>     Induced abortions usually are linked to unintended pregnancies, which often occur despite use of contraception (14,43,44). In 1995, data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) indicated that approximately 31% of live births were associated with unintended pregnancy (i.e., either mistimed or unwanted at conception) (11). Unintended pregnancy is not a problem just for adolescents, unmarried women, or for poor women; it is a pervasive public health problem for all women of reproductive age (11).</p>
<p>     In a study of abortion patients conducted during 1994 and 1995, 58% of patients reported that they &quot;currently used&quot; contraception during the month of their last menstrual period; however, their use of contraception might have been inconsistent or incorrect (25). In 1995, when the most recent NSFG was conducted, approximately 29% of sexually active U.S. women who used only oral contraceptives for birth control reported that they missed a birth-control pill one or more times during the 3 months before their NSFG interview. In addition, approximately 33% of U.S. women who were using only coitus-dependent contraceptive methods**** during the 3 months before the interview used these methods inconsistently (11). At present, not all health insurance plans provide full contraceptive benefits (45). Therefore, education regarding improved contraceptive use and practices as well as access to and education regarding safe, effective, and affordable contraception and family-planning services might help reduce the incidence of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, might reduce the use of legal induced abortion in the United States (46,47).</p>
<p>     Recently passed welfare-reform legislation -- the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996***** -- has increased the interest in accurate state-based surveillance for induced abortion. In addition, some states have instituted programs that emphasize the prevention of unintended pregnancy, particularly among adolescents. To help guide these efforts, an ongoing, accurate assessment of induced abortion is needed in all states to determine the number and characteristics of women who obtain these procedures.</p>
<p>     Additional statistical and epidemiologic information about legal induced abortions is available from CDC's automated Reproductive Health Information System. This system provides information by fax, voice recordings, or mail; telephone (888) 232-2306.

* Legal induced abortion-related deaths per 100,000 legal induced abortions.
+ In 1978, CDC defined &quot;spontaneous abortion-related deaths&quot; as those deaths that occurred at
  &lt;20 weeks of estimated gestational age. Deaths that occurred at an estimated gestational age
  of &gt;=20 weeks were classified as stillbirths. Before 1978, criteria for gestational age were
  unspecified.
