<H1>Progress in Hepatitis B Prevention Through Universal Infant Vaccination 
--- China, 1997--2006</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of illness and death in China. Approximately 60% of the 
population has a history of HBV infection, and 9.8% of persons in China are chronically infected with HBV and at risk for 
premature death from liver disease (<I>1</I>). Each year, an estimated 263,000 persons in China die from HBV-related liver cancer or 
cirrhosis, accounting for 37%--50% of HBV-related deaths worldwide 
(<I>2</I>). Because most HBV infections occur during infancy or 
early childhood, when HBV infection is most likely to become chronic, vaccination of infants beginning at birth is the key 
strategy for preventing chronic HBV infection. This report describes China's progress in increasing coverage among infants 
with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and timely administration of the HepB birth dose (i.e., within 24 hours of birth). 
Infant vaccination coverage with both the timely birth dose and the complete vaccine series was substantially higher among 
children born during 2003 than among those born during 1997; timely birth-dose coverage increased from 29.1% to 75.8%, 
and HepB series completion increased from 70.7% to 89.8%. Furthermore, in economically disadvantaged 
populations in western and middle provinces* targeted by the China-Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (China-GAVI) project, 
reported coverage with timely HepB birth dose increased from 64% in 2004 to 81% in 2006, and coverage with the complete 
HepB series increased from 52% in 2001 to 92% in 2006. China has established a goal to reduce chronic HBV infection 
among children aged &lt;5 years to &lt;1% by 2010 
(<I>3</I>). Achieving this goal will require continued commitment to increasing 
vaccination coverage in impoverished regions and ensuring that infants born at home are vaccinated within 24 hours of birth.
<H4>
<B>Hepatitis B Immunization Program</B>
</H4>
</P><P>HepB was first recommended for routine vaccination of infants in China in 1992, with the first dose to be 
administered within 24 hours of birth and subsequent doses at ages 1 and 6 months. However, because of high vaccine prices and user 
fees charged to parents by local health departments for vaccine purchase and administration, until 2002, infant 
vaccination occurred primarily in large cities of the wealthier eastern 
provinces.<SUP>&#134;</SUP> Beginning in 2002, infant hepatitis B vaccination 
was added to China's National Immunization Programme. Also in 2002, the China Ministry of Health 
began a project with the GAVI 
Alliance<SUP>&#167;</SUP> (formerly known as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation) to 
ensure HepB availability in China's poorest provinces and counties. The 5-year China-GAVI project provides free HepB, targeting approximately 
5.6 million children born each year in 12 western provinces and in government-designated 
poor<B> </B>counties in 10 middle provinces, covering approximately 36% of China's child population. In 2005, a new vaccination regulation abolished all charges and 
user fees for all nationally recommended vaccines, including hepatitis B; the vaccine is now free to all children in China. 
</P><P>To estimate national 3-dose HepB coverage and timely (i.e., within 24 hours of birth) HepB birth-dose coverage and 
to describe the effects of province and location of birth (e.g., home versus hospital) on vaccination coverage levels, data from 
two national vaccination coverage surveys conducted by the China Ministry of Health in 1999 and 2004 were 
reviewed. In both 1999 and 2004, parents were interviewed in house-to-house surveys regarding the vaccination status of eligible children 
born during the study periods. Sampling of households in each province was conducted using the probability proportional to 
size (PPS) method. In the 1999 survey, counties in each province were divided into four economic strata, and PPS sampling 
was conducted within each strata. In 2,173 counties in 31 provinces, parents of 25,878 children born during 1997 
were interviewed (<I>4</I>). In the 2004 survey, 273 counties were selected randomly from all counties throughout the country, 
including at least three counties in each province, and PPS sampling was conducted in each county; parents of 171,188 children 
born during 2001--2003 were interviewed (<I>5</I>). For both surveys, 3-dose HepB and timely HepB birth-dose coverage were 
measured by dividing the number of children receiving 3-dose HepB and timely HepB birth dose, respectively, by the number 
of children surveyed, taking into account the PPS sampling design.
</P><P>To examine in more detail the impact of the China-GAVI project, routine immunization-reporting--system data from 
2001 through 2006 for China-GAVI--funded provinces were reviewed. In this national reporting system, the numbers of 
children targeted for and receiving each dose of routinely recommended vaccines are compiled by each immunization clinic 
and reported monthly to provincial and national immunization programs. For this analysis, 3-dose HepB and timely HepB 
birth-dose coverage in China-GAVI--funded provinces were measured by comparing the ratio of the number of 
children receiving doses of HepB to the number of children targeted to receive doses of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (DTP) 
vaccine, because the latter represents the most accurate local estimate of the number of children requiring routine 
childhood vaccination. Timely HepB birth-dose coverage could only be analyzed from 2004 through 2006 since reporting of 
HepB birth-dose timing was not required by the China Ministry of Health until 2004. A mathematical model was used to 
calculate hepatitis B disease burden before inception of the vaccination program and to estimate the number of deaths 
prevented through vaccination (<I>1,2</I>). 
<H4>
<B>National Vaccination Coverage Survey</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Comparison of the two national vaccination coverage surveys indicated that estimated 3-dose HepB coverage 
increased substantially overall, from 70.7% among children born in 1997 to 89.8% among children born in 2003 (<a href = "mm5618a2.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). 
Timely HepB birth-dose coverage also increased, from 29.1% among children born in 1997 to 75.8% among children born in 
2003 (<a href = "mm5618a2.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). During 1997--2003, estimated national 3-dose DTP coverage remained level (93%). The difference between 
3-dose HepB coverage and 3-dose DTP coverage was reduced from 20% in 1997 to 3% in 2003. 
</P><P>In the 2004 survey, estimated coverage was substantially lower in western provinces (68.0% for 3 doses of HepB and 
49.5% for timely birth dose) than in middle provinces 
(91.8%<B> </B>for 3 doses of HepB and 72.7%<B> 
</B>for timely birth dose) or eastern provinces (94.1% for 3 doses of HepB and 81.9% for timely birth dose) (<a href = "mm5618a2.htm#fig2">Figure 2</a>). 
</P><P>Timely birth-dose coverage among infants born at home during 2001--2003 was less than half that of those born 
in hospitals. Among children born in 2004, timely birth-dose coverage for infants born in township hospitals was only two 
thirds that of those born in county, provincial, or national hospitals.
<H4>
<B>China-GAVI Project </B>
</H4>
</P><P>For the period 2003--2006, 3-dose HepB coverage and timely HepB birth-dose coverage increased in the 12 
western provinces and in the counties in 10 middle provinces 
supported by the China-GAVI project. In 2006, the ratios of 
3-dose HepB/3-dose DTP coverage and timely HepB birth dose/first-dose DTP coverage were 92% and 81%, respectively 
(<a href = "mm5618a2.htm#fig3">Figure 3</a>). During 2003--2006, approximately 15.4 million children in China-GAVI project counties received the 3-dose HepB 
series, preventing an estimated 1.47 million chronic HBV infections in children and 265,000 future deaths attributable to 
chronic HBV infection.

</I>
<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> China has made substantial progress in implementing universal, timely hepatitis B vaccination for infants 
and in reducing disparities in coverage between the poorest and wealthiest parts of the country. The support from the 
China-GAVI project has improved vaccination coverage and helped prevent chronic HBV infection in children. During 
2003--2006, approximately 15 million children in China-GAVI--funded provinces and approximately 42 million 
children nationwide received HepB. 
</P><P>Since 2002, implementation of universal infant hepatitis B vaccination in China has focused particularly on 
improving timely administration of the birth dose. Approaches used to increase timely birth-dose coverage have included 1) 
increasing the percentage of births that occur in hospitals; 2) improving vaccine availability in hospitals and township health facilities; 
3) building collaboration among delivery services (i.e., maternal and child health programs and obstetrics) and 
between vaccination services (i.e., immunization programs and pediatrics) in hospitals and township health centers; 4) increasing 
the awareness of the importance of timely birth-dose administration among providers and parents; 5) intensifying 
training, supervision, and monitoring of county, township, and village health workers; and 6) providing subsidies to village doctors 
to provide vaccines.
</P><P>Disparities in vaccination coverage continue to exist by 
region and by location of birth. Despite the China-GAVI 
activities, during 1997--2006, children from eastern provinces had substantially higher coverage than those from middle or 
western provinces, as did children born in hospitals versus those born at home. Income levels continue to be highest in China's 
eastern provinces and lowest in the western provinces; residents in eastern provinces generally have greater access to and ability to 
pay for health care, including hospital care for childbirth. Children born in hospitals generally have better access to 
immunization services and can be vaccinated more easily within 24 hours of birth. In western China, children are more likely to live 
in remote, mountainous areas and have less access to hospital delivery and immunization services. The China Ministry of 
Health is implementing programs to increase births in hospitals nationwide by expanding and 
improving obstetric care in health-care facilities throughout China and providing incentives to give birth in hospitals.
</P><P>Prevention of chronic HBV infection in China is integral to global initiatives to reduce the burden of HBV infection. 
In 1992, the World Health Assembly passed resolution 45.17, which called for all World Health Organization (WHO) 
member states to integrate cost-effective new vaccines, including HepB, into national immunization programs where feasible. The 
same year, WHO recommended that HepB be included in routine vaccination schedules for all children in all countries 
(<I>6</I>). During 2000--2006, the GAVI Alliance has provided support for HepB introduction to 51 less developed member states 
(i.e., countries with less than [U.S.] $1,000 per capita gross national income), and these countries have made substantial progress 
in introducing HepB into their vaccination schedules 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5236a5.htm">7</a></I>). As of 2005, a total of 154 (80%) of 192 WHO member 
states reported having integrated HepB into their routine infant vaccination schedules; global coverage with 3-dose HepB 
had increased from 32% in 2001 to 55% in 2005, with 2005 coverage varying by WHO region (South-East Asia: 27%; 
Africa: 39%; Eastern Mediterranean: 74%: Europe: 76%; Americas: 85%; Western Pacific: 87%) 
(<I>8</I>). The advances in hepatitis B vaccination have led countries and WHO regions to set goals for the elimination of HBV transmission. The WHO 
Western Pacific Region has committed to reducing chronic HBV infection in children aged &lt;5 years to &lt;2% by 2012.
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, the design of the national surveys conducted in 
1999 and 2004 differed in how counties were stratified before PPS sampling, which might limit comparability of the two 
surveys. Second, for the analyses using data from the routine immunization reporting system, the precise number of children 
requiring vaccination at local levels is not known 
because some children might not be registered; hence, the use of children targeted 
to receive DTP vaccine as a surrogate for total number of children might result in overestimation of 
reported vaccination coverage. 
</P><P>Despite China's progress in increasing hepatitis B vaccination coverage and timely administration of the birth 
dose, challenges remain to reaching the national goal of &lt;1% chronic HBV infection among children aged &lt;5 years by 
2010. Achieving this goal will require increasing 3-dose HepB coverage to the same level as 3-dose DTP coverage and 
increasing timely HepB birth-dose coverage to 90% in all provinces. The greatest challenge is to increase administration of the birth 
dose among children born at home. Three provinces (Guizhou, Tibet, and Yunnan) and 42% of China-GAVI project counties 
still have timely birth-dose coverage levels of &lt;75% and are most in need of targeted interventions. Although most hospitals 
now are achieving &gt;95% timely birth-dose coverage for infants born in hospitals, strategies are needed to ensure that 
false contraindications to vaccination, including low birth weight and unstable medical condition at birth 
(<I>9</I>), do not delay administration of the birth dose. Innovative measures also are needed to reach infants born at home, particularly 
through 

linking prenatal care and birthing-care providers with immunization program staff at township and village levels. With 
these improvements, China can reduce substantially the 
burden of hepatitis B.
