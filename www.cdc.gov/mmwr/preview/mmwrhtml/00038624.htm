<h1>Blood Lead Levels Among Children in a Managed-Care Organization --  California, October 1992-March 1993 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Despite substantial progress in reducing exposures to lead
among children, as recently as 1991, 9% of children in the United
States had blood lead levels (BLLs) of greater than or equal to 10
ug/dL (1) -- levels that can adversely affect intelligence and
behavior. In 1991, CDC recommended screening all children for lead
exposure except those residing in communities in which large
numbers or percentages previously had been screened and determined
not to have lead poisoning (2). Subsequently, the California
Department of Health Services (CDHS) issued a directive to all
California health-care providers participating in the Child Health
and Disability Prevention Program to routinely screen children for
lead poisoning in accordance with the 1991 CDC guidelines (3). This

report presents findings of BLL testing during 1992-1993 from a
managed-care organization that provides primary-care services to
Medicaid beneficiaries in several locations in California (i.e.,
Los Angeles County, Orange County, San Bernardino County, Riverside

County, Sacramento, and Placerville). </p>
<p>From October 1992 through March 1993, BLLs were measured for
2864 consecutive children aged 1-6 years who received Medicaid
benefits. Data were not collected about the number of children
whose families did not consent to testing nor about those from whom

blood could not be collected. Blood submitted by venipuncture was
analyzed by a laboratory certified by the CDHS as proficient in
blood lead analysis. Families completed a risk questionnaire (2)
about exposures to older housing, home renovation or remodeling,
adults with jobs or hobbies that involve lead, and industrial
sources of lead, and answered a question about whether the child's
playmates or siblings were known to have BLLs greater than or equal

to 10 ug/dL. Children were categorized as &quot;low risk&quot; if all five
questions were answered &quot;no&quot; or &quot;high risk&quot; if one or more
questions were answered &quot;yes.&quot; </p>
<p>Overall, 2808 (98.0%) children had BLLs less than 10 ug/dL; 46

(1.7%) had BLLs 10-14 ug/dL, and 10 (0.3%) had BLLs greater than or

equal to 15 ug/dL (<a href="00038624.htm#00001235.htm">Table_1</a> and <a href="00038624.htm#00001236.htm">Table_2</a>). The percentage of
children with BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL was similar
 across
age groups <a href="00038624.htm#00001235.htm">Table_1</a>. Although BLLs varied by clinic site
 <a href="00038624.htm#00001236.htm">Table_2</a>,
no site had a prevalence of elevated BLLs exceeding 4.6%. </p>
<p>The risk questionnaire had a sensitivity of 46%, specificity
of 74%, and predictive values positive and negative of 3.4% and
98.6%, respectively. The prevalence of increased BLLs was greater
among children identified as high risk (3.4%) than among other
children (1.4%, prevalence ratio: 2.4; 95% confidence
interval=1.4%-4.1%). </p>
<p>Based on the CDHS reimbursement rate of $22.45 per test, the
cost of screening tests per case identified was $1148 to identify
a child with a BLL greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL and $9185 to
identify a child with a BLL greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL. </p>
<p>Reported by: CD Molina, MD, JM Molina, MD, Molina Medical Centers,
Long Beach, California. Lead Poisoning Prevention Br, Div of
Environmental Health and Hazard Evaluation, National Center for
Environmental Health, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: From 1991 through 1993, the number of California
children identified with BLLs of at least 25 ug/dL increased from
approximately 40 per year to approximately 500 per year (3).
Universal screening also has substantially increased the number of
lead-exposed children requiring individual management identified in

some populations outside California (4). </p>
<p>The burden of lead exposure varies among different U.S.
communities and population subgroups. For example, prevalences of
elevated BLLs have ranged from 37% among black children who reside
in central cities to 5% among non-Hispanic white children who do
not live in central cities (1). The prevalences of elevated BLLs in

smaller jurisdictions or nonrepresentative clinic-based populations

also varies widely, with lead-exposure prevalences ranging from
less than 1% (5) to greater than 50% (6). Purposes of this study
were to estimate lead-exposure prevalence in the population served
by the managed-care organization, assess the performance of a
questionnaire in identifying higher risk children, and help assess
the usefulness of a universal screening policy in this population. </p>
<p>The finding that prevalences of elevated BLLs were low among
Medicaid recipients attending clinics at the managed-care
organization was unexpected because previous population-based
surveys in Compton and Sacramento had documented substantially
higher prevalences of lead exposure (7). However, because the
likelihood of lead exposure is greater in the summer and this
assessment encompassed winter months (8), seasonal patterns may
have accounted for some of the difference. The difference also may
have reflected variations in the study design between this
(clinic-based) and previous (population-based) assessments (9) and
previously documented wide variations in prevalences of elevated
BLLs among even apparently homogenous groups (10). Because
characteristics of children receiving care at the managed-care
organization probably differ from those of other groups of children

in California, the findings in this report cannot be generalized. </p>
<p>In this population, a standard risk questionnaire was of
limited use in identifying children at higher risk for lead
exposure: the prevalence of elevated BLLs was 3.4% in &quot;high risk&quot;
children compared with 1.4% in lower risk children. Although this
difference was statistically significant, the clinical utility of
this finding is limited as a means for targeting blood lead
testing. The usefulness of questionnaires to target BLL screening
might be increased by adding locally important risk factors to such

questionnaires (10). Questionnaires also may be useful in some
settings to target education about potentially remediable risk
factors for lead exposure regardless of children's current BLLs. </p>
<p>The primary strategy for preventing lead poisoning is to
reduce lead sources in the environment before children are exposed.

However, because large environmental reservoirs of lead persist,
especially in older housing, BLL screening and follow-up of
children with elevated BLLs continues to be an important method for

controlling lead exposure among children. </p>
<p>The role of universal screening in relatively low-prevalence
communities and practices has nonetheless been questioned (6). The
purpose of screening is to identify children who require individual

follow-up and medical or environmental management (i.e., children
whose BLLs are persistently at least 15 ug/dL). In populations such

as those served by the managed-care organization, in which small
numbers of children who require individual management are
identified by universal screening, alternative approaches to the
prevention of childhood lead poisoning may include a combination of

environmental controls, education, and more selective screening. </p>
