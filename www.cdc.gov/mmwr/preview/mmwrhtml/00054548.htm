<h1>Ciguatera Fish Poisoning -- Texas, 1997 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>On October 21, 1997, the Southeast Texas Poison Center was
contacted by a local physician requesting information about
treatment for crew members of a cargo ship docked in Freeport,
Texas, who were ill with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and muscle
weakness. This report summarizes an investigation of this outbreak
by the Texas Department of Health (TDH), which indicated that 17
crew members experienced ciguatera fish poisoning resulting from
eating a contaminated barracuda. </p>
<p>On October 12 and 13, gastrointestinal illness developed in
crew members aboard a Norwegian cargo ship. After the ship had
docked, on October 22 interviews were conducted with 23 (85%) of 27

crew members. A case was defined as ciguatera fish poisoning if
there was a combination of gastrointestinal symptoms (i.e., nausea,

vomiting, diarrhea, or abdominal cramps) and neurologic symptoms
(i.e., muscle pain, weakness, dizziness, numbness or itching of the

mouth, hands, or feet) in a crew member after eating fish on
October 12. Of the 23 interviewed, 17 (74%) crew members reported
the following symptoms: diarrhea (17 {100%}), abdominal cramps (14
{82%}), nausea (13 {76%}), and vomiting (13 {76%}). Symptoms
occurred within 2-16 hours (median: 4.5 hours) after eating fish at

approximately 7 p.m. on October 12. By October 14, all ill crew
members had experienced neurologic symptoms characteristic of
ciguatera poisoning: 15 (88%) reported muscle weakness and pain; 13

(76%), numbness or itching of the mouth; 11 (65%), pruritus of the
feet and/or hands; 11 (65%), temperature sensation reversal; 10
(59%), dizziness; and eight (47%), aching or loose-feeling teeth. </p>
<p>On October 21, all 17 ill crew members sought medical care at
a clinic. None of the crew members were hospitalized; treatment
consisted of supportive measures to reduce discomfort from
symptoms. All patients were men aged 23-46 years. </p>
<p>Based on food histories from the 23 crew members, TDH
suspected consumption of a barracuda caught by crew members while
fishing near the Cay Sal Bank of the Bahamas on October 11 as the
source of illness. Seventeen crew members ate the barracuda, and
all became ill. None of the eight crew members who did not eat
barracuda became ill. Although crew members also ate red snapper
and grouper at the same meal, neither of these fish were linked
epidemiologically with illness. </p>
<p>Results of cultures of stool samples from 16 crew members were

negative for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, and
Vibrio. Three samples of leftover raw barracuda and red snapper
that were caught simultaneously with the barracuda that was eaten
were recovered from cold storage and then tested for ciguatoxin
using an experimental membrane immunobead assay at the Department
of Pathology, University of Hawaii. The samples from both fish
tested positive for ciguatoxin. </p>

EIS officers, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: Ciguatera poisoning occurs throughout the Caribbean

and tropical Pacific regions, where outbreaks have been reported
among both residents and tourists. From 1983 through 1992 in the
United States, 129 outbreaks of ciguatera poisoning involving 508
persons were reported to CDC; no ciguatera-related deaths were
reported (1,2). Most outbreaks were reported from Hawaii (111) and
Florida (10), although outbreaks and sporadic cases in California
(two), Vermont (one), New York (one), and Illinois (one) also have
been associated with consumption of fish imported from tropical
waters (3,4). The outbreak described in this report was recognized
in an area not typically associated with ciguatera intoxication and

underscores that ciguatera poisoning can occur among travelers
returning from areas where ciguatera is endemic or among persons
consuming fish imported from those areas. </p>
<p>Ciguatera toxins are produced by dinoflagellates, which
herbivorous fish consume. These fish are then eaten by large,
predatory reef fish (e.g., barracuda, grouper, and amberjacks),
which appear to be unharmed by the toxin; because the toxins are
lipid-soluble, they accumulate through the food chain. The toxin
may be most concentrated in the head, viscera, and roe.
Ciguatoxin-containing fish may be highly localized; islands may
have some reefs where the fish are inedible because of the toxin
and other reefs where the fish are unaffected. No deep-sea fish
(e.g., tuna, dolphin, or wahoo) have been found to carry
ciguatoxin. </p>
<p>As in this outbreak, ciguatera fish poisoning is diagnosed by
the characteristic combination of acute gastrointestinal symptoms
(developing within 3-6 hours after ingestion of contaminated fish;
watery diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain occur and typically
lasting approximately 12 hours) and neurologic symptoms (circumoral

and extremity paresthesia, severe pruritus, and hot-cold
temperature reversal) in persons who eat large, predatory reef
fish. Neurologic symptoms may be worsened by alcohol consumption,
exercise, sexual intercourse, or changes in dietary behavior, such
as dieting or high-protein meals (5; R.W. Dickey, Ph.D., Center for

Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration,
personal communication, 1998). Occasionally, hypotension,
respiratory depression, and coma develop in patients. Mean duration

of acute illness is typically 8.5 days, although neurologic
symptoms may last for months (6). Because there is no approved
human assay for ciguatoxin, the diagnosis is based on clinical
findings and by the detection of toxin in samples of fish. No known

antidote for ciguatoxin poisoning has been proven, and treatment is

primarily for relief of symptoms. Intravenous mannitol may be
effective early in the course of illness, but the results of a
randomized, placebo-controlled trial of mannitol therapy have not
been reported (7-9). </p>
<p>Ciguatoxins are odorless, colorless, tasteless, and unaffected

by either cooking or freezing; therefore, persons living in or
traveling to areas where ciguatera toxin is endemic should follow
these general precautions: 1) avoid consuming large, predatory reef

fish, especially barracuda; 2) avoid eating the head, viscera, or
roe of any reef fish; and 3) avoid eating fish caught at sites with

known ciguatera toxins. Persons traveling to areas where ciguatera
is endemic should contact local health officials for more specific
recommendations pertaining to that area. Fishermen should avoid
known ciguatera-contaminated areas, and vendors should not sell
fish caught in those areas. </p>
<p>Ill persons with suspected ciguatera poisoning should promptly

seek medical care and save any uneaten portions of fish in a
freezer. Suspected cases should be reported to state or local
public health officials to assist with the investigation and
control of a possible outbreak. Additional information is available

about ciguatoxin testing of implicated fish from the Gulf Coast
Seafood Laboratory of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
Dauphin Island, Alabama, telephone (334) 694-4480, or the
University of Hawaii, Honolulu, telephone (808) 956-8682. For
general information about seafood safety, call FDA's Seafood
Hotline, telephone (800) 332-4010. </p>
