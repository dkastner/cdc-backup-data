<h1>Children with Elevated Blood Lead Levels
Attributed to Home Renovation and Remodeling Activities  --
New York, 1993-1994 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Renovation and remodeling activities that disturb lead-based
 paint can
create substantial amounts of lead dust in the home; such dust can
 then be
inhaled or ingested by children (1). In January 1995, the New York
 State
Department of Health (NYSDOH) assessed lead exposure among children

resulting from home renovation and remodeling during 1993-1994.
 This report
summarizes findings of the study, which identified 320 children in
 New York
state (excluding New York City) with blood lead levels (BLLs)
 greater than
or equal to 20 ug/dL that were considered to be attributable to
 residential
renovation and remodeling. </p>
<p>In December 1993, New York enacted a state law requiring that
 all
children undergo blood lead screening at ages 1 and 2 years;
 however, some
children are not screened. For children with confirmed elevated
 BLLs or
evidence of high-dose lead exposures, BLL testing is required
 through age 6
years. For some children aged &gt;6 years, BLLs are tested when there
 are
symptoms of lead poisoning or when there is another reason to
 suspect lead
exposure. All BLL results must be reported to NYSDOH by
 laboratories
performing these tests, which provides results for children aged
 less than
or equal to 14 years to respective local health departments. Local
 health
departments then are responsible for environmental investigation
 and
follow-up of children aged <6 years with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL. </p>
<p>During 1993-1994, a total of 4608 children with venous BLLs
 greater
than or equal to 20 ug/dL in New York were reported to local health

departments. In January 1995, environmental health and nursing
 staff of the
local health departments reviewed the case records of these
 children to
identify those who within the previous year had been exposed to
 residential
renovation or remodeling activities that involved disturbing
 lead-based
paint and for whom another likely source of lead exposure could not
 be
identified. Disturbed paint was presumed to have been lead-based if
 lead
was found in similar paint that remained in the home. For each
 case, data
abstracted included 1) child's birth date, 2) blood test date, 3)
 BLL, 4)
address of the dwelling, 5) method used to remove old paint, and 6)

identity of the person who performed the paint removal. Dwellings
 were
classified as being in rural, suburban, or urban areas based on the
 average
number of persons per square mile residing within the census block
 (rural:
0-2000 persons; suburban: 2001-15,000; and urban: greater than or
 equal to
15,001) (2). </p>
<p>Review of records for 1993-1994 identified 320 (6.9%) children
 in 258
households with elevated BLLs considered to be attributable to
 renovation
and remodeling. Age was known for 289 children; of these, 29 (10%)
 were
aged <1 year; 92 (32%), aged 1 year; 71 (25%), aged 2 years; 37 (13%), aged 3 years; 41 (14%), aged 4 years; 10 (3%), aged 5 years; and nine (3%), aged 6-10 years. BLLs were 20-24 ug/dL in 117 (37%) children, 25-29 ug/dL in 76 (24%), 30-39 ug/dL in 87 (27%), 40-59 ug/dL in 32 (10%), 60-79 in seven (2%), and greater than or equal to 80 ug/dL in one (<1%). Area of residence was known for 281 children; 120 (43%) resided in suburban areas, 101 (36%) in rural areas, and 60 (21%) in urban areas. </p>
<p>For 150 children, more than one type of paint removal activity
 was
reported. Removal activities included scraping (150 reports),
 sanding
(137), chemical stripping (62), using hand-held heat guns (28),
 using blow
torches (nine), and blasting with either water or an abrasive
 material
(six). There were 88 reports of complete removal of a painted
 component
(e.g., wall, window, or stair). Information about who performed
 paint
removal was known for 302 children; work was performed by a
 resident owner
or tenant (187 {62%} children), by a nonresident owner (66 {22%}
 children),
by a contractor (42 {14%} children), or by a nonprofessional
 employee
(seven {2%} children). </p>

 York

 Environmental
Hazards and Health Effects, National Center for Environmental
 Health, CDC. </p><h3>Editorial Note</h3>
<p>Editorial Note: Childhood lead exposure is a preventable
 environmental
health problem that usually occurs in residential settings (3). In
 the
United States, an estimated 1.7 million children aged <6 years have BLLs greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL and approximately 200,000 have BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL (4). BLLs at least as low as 10 ug/dL are associated with adverse effects on children's behavior and development (3). CDC has recommended 1) nutritional and educational interventions for children identified with BLLs 10-19 ug/dL, 2) environmental evaluation to identify lead hazards for children with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL or with BLLs that persist at greater than or equal to 15 ug/dL, and 3) medical evaluation and intervention for children with BLLs greater than or equal to 20 ug/dL (3). </p>
<p>The findings in this report suggest that home renovation and
 remodeling
was an important source of lead exposure among children in New York
 during
1993-1994. Although some of the 320 children may have been exposed
 to
sources of lead other than or in addition to renovation and
 remodeling,
this assessment probably underestimates the burden of lead exposure

associated with renovation and remodeling in New York for at least
 four
reasons. First, children with elevated BLLs <20 ug/dL were not included in this study. Second, many children who were exposed to lead during home renovation or remodeling may not have had BLL testing both because universal screening was not a legal requirement until December 1993 and because screening rates were low among children aged>2 years and
 among
those who did not live in urban areas. Third, some laboratories may
 have
incompletely reported children with BLLs greater than or equal to
 20 ug/dL.
Finally, information on renovation and remodeling was not routinely

collected during environmental investigations before this study; as
 a
result, some children with these exposures may not have been
 identified in
their case records. </p>
<p>In 1978, the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned
 manufacture and
use of paint containing &gt;0.06% lead by weight for interior and
 exterior
residential surfaces, toys, and furniture. Because the
 concentration of
lead in paint steadily declined before 1978 (5), older homes are
 more
likely to have paint with higher concentrations of lead. The risk
 for lead
exposure associated with this source is greatest in homes built
 before 1950
(6); in New York, both the number (3,401,416) and proportion (47%)
 of
housing units built before 1950 are greater than in any other state
 (7). </p>
<p>Children can be exposed to lead-based paint in housing if the
 paint is
in a form that can be inhaled or ingested (e.g., chipping, peeling,
 or
pulverized to dust). Renovation and remodeling may generate lead
 dust and
fumes. In this analysis, paint removal in most (86%) cases was
 performed by
persons who were not professional contractors and who may have been
 unaware
of lead hazards and protective measures for safely containing dust
 and
paint chips. Their work primarily involved sanding and scraping,
 methods
that are potentially hazardous but require no training and little
 financial
investment (1). </p>
<p>Persons who remove lead-based paint from dwellings should
 follow the
recommendations of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
 Development and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for minimizing lead
 exposure
(1,8). These include 1) relocating occupants during paint removal
 and
prohibiting children and pregnant women from entering the work
 area; 2)
isolating areas where work is being performed from other areas of
 the house
and avoiding practices that create lead dust or fumes; 3)
 performing a full
clean-up after work is completed; and 4) considering the monitoring
 of BLLs
in persons who live or work in the dwelling. </p>
<p>Although children residing in poverty and in urban areas are at
 the
highest risk for lead exposure (4), 79% of the children identified
 in this
study resided in suburban or rural settings. This finding
 underscores that
in all communities with older housing, appropriate actions include
 public
education about lead hazards, provider-based anticipatory guidance
 about
lead hazards, and BLL screening of children. </p>
<p>As a result of this investigation, local health departments in
 New York
now routinely collect information about renovation and remodeling
 when
investigating the home environments of children with elevated BLLs.

Information about this potential source of lead exposure will be
 reported
to NYSDOH, which will use these data to monitor trends in causes of

childhood lead poisoning and identify areas to be targeted for
 educational
outreach activities. </p>
