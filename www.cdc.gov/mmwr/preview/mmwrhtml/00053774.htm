 </p>
<p>Abstract </p>
<p>Condition: Since 1990 (i.e., the year in which the number of
 abortions was
highest), the annual number of abortions in the United States has
 decreased
by 15%. </p>
<p>Reporting Period Covered: This report summarizes and reviews
 information
reported to CDC regarding legal induced abortions obtained in the
 United
States during 1995. </p>
<p>Description of System: For each year since 1969, CDC has compiled
 abortion
data received from 52 reporting areas: 50 states, the District of
 Columbia,
and New York City. </p>
<p>Results: In 1995, a total of 1,210,883 legal abortions were
 reported to
CDC, representing a 4.5% decrease from the number reported for
 1994. The
abortion ratio was 311 legal induced abortions per 1,000 live
 births, and
the abortion rate was 20 per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years, the
 lowest ratio
and rate recorded since 1975. Women who were undergoing an abortion
 were
more likely to be young, white, and unmarried; most were obtaining
 an
abortion for the first time. Approximately half of all abortions
 (54%) were
performed at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation, and
 approximately
88% were performed before 13 weeks. Approximately 16% of abortions
 were
performed at the earliest weeks of gestation (less than or equal to
 6
weeks), approximately 17% at 7 weeks of gestation, and
 approximately 21% at
8 weeks of gestation. Few abortions were provided after 15 weeks of

gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were obtained at 16-20
 weeks,
and 1.4% were obtained at greater than or equal to 21 weeks.
 Younger women
(i.e., women aged less than or equal to 24 years) were more likely
 to
obtain abortions later in pregnancy than were older women. </p>
<p>Interpretation: Since 1990, the number of abortions has declined
 each year.
Since 1987, the abortion-to-live-birth ratio has declined; in 1995,
 it was
the lowest recorded since 1975. This decrease in the abortion ratio

reflects a trend that a lower proportion of pregnant women obtain
 induced
abortion. </p>
<p>Actions Taken: The number and characteristics of women who obtain
 abortions
in the United States should continue to be monitored so that trends
 in
induced abortion can be assessed, efforts to prevent unintended
 pregnancy
can be evaluated, and the preventable causes of morbidity and
 mortality
associated with abortions can be identified and reduced. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the
 number and
characteristics of women obtaining legal induced abortions, to
 monitor
unintended pregnancy, and to assist efforts to identify and reduce
preventable causes of morbidity and mortality associated with
 abortions.
This report is based on abortion data for 1995 provided to CDC's
 National
Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,
 Division of
Reproductive Health. </p>
<p>METHODS </p>
<p>For 1995, CDC compiled data from 52 reporting areas: 50
 states, the
District of Columbia, and New York City. The total number of legal
 induced
abortions was available from all reporting areas; however, not all
 of these
areas collected information regarding the characteristics of women
 who
obtained abortions. </p>
<p>The availability of information about characteristics of women
 who
obtained an abortion in 1995 varied by state. Most states (42
 states, the
District of Columbia, and New York City) collected and reported
 abortion
data by age of the woman, whereas only 21 states, the District of
 Columbia,
and New York City collected and reported adequate abortion data by
 Hispanic
ethnicity. In the &quot;Results&quot; section of this report, all of the
 percentage
data for each characteristic represent known characteristics
 without
redistribution of the unknowns. States were excluded from the
 analysis if
data regarding a given characteristic were unknown for greater than
 15% of
women (<a href="00053774.htm#00003243.htm">Table_3</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003244.htm">Table_4</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003245.htm">Table_5</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003246.htm">Table_6</a>,
 <a href="00053774.htm#00003247.htm">Table_7</a>,
<a href="00053774.htm#00003248.htm">Table_8</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003249.htm">Table_9</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003250.htm">Table_10</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003251.htm">Table_11</a>, <a href="00053774.htm#00003252.htm">Table_12</a>,

<a href="00053774.htm#00003253.htm">Table_13</a>). </p>
<p>For 48 reporting areas, data concerning the number and
 characteristics
of women obtaining legal induced abortions were provided by the
 central
health agency *; for the other four areas, data were provided from
hospitals and other medical facilities. Because information
 concerning the
residence of women who obtained abortions was not available from
 some
states, the procedures were reported by the state in which they
 were
performed. However, for two reporting areas (i.e., District of
 Columbia and
Wisconsin) occurrence data were unavailable. </p>
<p>For analysis by age, women who obtained legal induced
 abortions were
grouped by 5-year age groups. Both ratios (i.e., the number of
 abortions
per 1,000 live births per year) and rates (the number of abortions
 per
1,000 women per year) are presented by age group in this report.
 Ratios
were calculated by using the number of live births provided by each
 state's
central health agency (except where noted), and rates were
 calculated by
using the number of women reported in special unpublished
 tabulations
provided by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Because almost all (94%)

abortions among women aged less than 15 years in 1988 (the most
 recent year
for which exact age data were available) occurred among those aged
 13-14
years (1), the population of women aged 13-14 years was used as the

denominator for calculating abortion rates for women aged less than
 15
years. Rates for women aged greater than or equal to 40 years were
 based on
the number of women aged 40-44 years, whereas rates for all women
 who
obtained abortions were based on the population of women aged 15-44
 years. </p>
<p>Race was categorized by three groups (i.e., a} white, b}
 black, and c}
all other races) or two groups (i.e., a} white and b} black and all
 other
races). &quot;Other&quot; races included Asian/Pacific Islander, American
 Indian,
Alaska Native, and women classified as &quot;other&quot; race. </p>
<p>In 1990, data regarding Hispanic ethnicity were first
 available on
abortion reports submitted to CDC by central health agencies. As in

previous reports, Hispanic ethnicity and race were evaluated
 separately,
and rates and ratios are presented by Hispanic ethnicity and race. </p>
<p>Marital status was reported as either married (which included
 women
who were married or separated) or unmarried (which usually included
 those
who were never married, divorced, or widowed). Reporting of marital
 status
differed somewhat by state, particularly for the data used as
 denominators
to calculate abortion ratios by marital status; therefore, abortion
 ratios
by marital status should be interpreted cautiously. </p>
<p>Most areas (38 of 40) that reported adequate data on week of
 gestation
at the time of abortion also reported procedures obtained at less
 than or
equal to 6, 7, and 8 weeks of gestation. Gestational age (in weeks)
 at the
time of abortion was reported by most areas from estimates derived
 from the
time elapsed since the woman's last menstrual period. In 18 states
 in 1995,
gestational age was reported on the basis of the physician's
 estimate for
each reported abortion or when information regarding the last
 menstrual
period was missing or illogical. Physician's estimates for
 gestational age
also could have included information from the clinical examination,
 as well
as the time elapsed since the last menstrual period. </p>
<p>RESULTS </p>
<p>In 1995, a total of 1,210,883 legal induced abortions were
 reported to
CDC, representing a 4.5% decrease from the number reported for 1994
 (2)
(<a href="00053774.htm#00003241.htm">Table_1</a>). In contrast, from 1970 through 1982, the reported
 number of
legal abortions in the United States had increased every year
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003242.htm">Table_2</a>;
<a href="00053774.htm#00001730.gif">Figure_1</a>); the largest percentage increase occurred from 1970
 to 1971.
From 1976 through 1982, the annual increase declined and reached a
 low of
0.2% during 1980-1981 and during 1981-1982. From 1983 through 1990,
 the
number of abortions increased again, although moderately (less than
 or
equal to 5% from year to year). However, since 1990, the annual
 number of
abortions has decreased each year. </p>
<p>The national legal induced abortion ratio increased from 1970
 to 1980,
peaked at 364 per 1,000 live births in 1984, and began to decline
 steadily
in 1987, from 356 per 1,000 to 311 per 1,000 in 1995 (<a href="00053774.htm#00001730.gif">Figure_1</a>;

<a href="00053774.htm#00003242.htm">Table_2</a>). The national legal induced abortion rate increased
 from five
abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years in 1970 to 25 per 1,000
 in 1980.
From 1981 through 1992, the rate remained stable at 23-24 abortions
 per
1,000 women, then declined to 22 in 1993, to 21 in 1994, and to 20
 in 1995. </p>
<p>In 1995, as in previous years, most legal induced abortions
 were
performed in California, New York City, Texas, and Florida; the
 fewest were
performed in Wyoming, Idaho, South Dakota, and North Dakota
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003243.htm">Table_3</a>)
(2). For women whose state of residence was known, approximately
 92% had
obtained the abortion within the state in which they resided. The
percentage of abortions obtained by out-of-state residents ranged
 from
approximately 53% in the District of Columbia to less than 1% in
 Hawaii.
For 1995, nine reporting areas could not provide data concerning
 abortions
obtained by out-of-state residents. </p>
<p>Women aged 20-24 years obtained approximately one third (32%)
 of all
abortions; women aged less than 15 years obtained less than 1% of
 all
abortions (<a href="00053774.htm#00003244.htm">Table_4</a>). Abortion ratios were highest for the
 youngest
women (i.e., 667 abortions per 1,000 live births for women aged
 less than
15 years and 399 per 1,000 for women aged 15-19 years) and for the
 oldest
women (387 per 1,000 live births for women aged greater than or
 equal to 40
years). The ratio was lowest for women aged 30-34 years (165 per
 1,000 live
births) (<a href="00053774.htm#00001731.gif">Figure_2</a>; <a href="00053774.htm#00003244.htm">Table_4</a>). Among adolescents, the
 abortion ratio
was highest for those aged less than 15 years and lowest for those
 aged 19
years (<a href="00053774.htm#00003245.htm">Table_5</a>). </p>
<p>In contrast to abortion ratios, abortion rates were highest
 for women
aged 20-24 years (37 abortions per 1,000 women) and lowest for
 women at the
reproductive-age extremes (i.e., two per 1,000 women aged less than
 15
years and two per 1,000 women aged greater than or equal to 40
 years)
(<a href="00053774.htm#00003244.htm">Table_4</a>). </p>
<p>For women in most age groups, the abortion ratio increased
 from 1974
through the early 1980s and declined thereafter, particularly for
 the
youngest and oldest reproductive-aged women (<a href="00053774.htm#00001732.gif">Figure_3</a>).
 Abortion ratios
for women aged less than 15 years have been and remain higher than
 those
for the other age groups. From 1994 to 1995, the abortion ratio
 decreased
for women aged less than 15 and 15-19 years and was the lowest ever

recorded for these age groups. The abortion ratio for women aged
 20-34
years (i.e., the group with the highest fertility rate) (3) has
 remained
stable since the mid-1980s. </p>
<p>During 1995, approximately 53% of reported legal induced
 abortions
were obtained at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation, and
approximately 86% were obtained at less than 13 weeks
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003246.htm">Table_6</a>).
Approximately 15% of abortions were performed at the earliest weeks
 of
gestation (less than or equal to 6 weeks), approximately 17% at 7
 weeks,
and approximately 21% at 8 weeks (<a href="00053774.htm#00003247.htm">Table_7</a>). Few abortions were
 provided
after 15 weeks of gestation -- approximately 4% of abortions were
 obtained
at 16-20 weeks, and 1.4% were obtained at greater than or equal to
 21 weeks
(<a href="00053774.htm#00001733.gif">Figure_4</a>; <a href="00053774.htm#00003246.htm">Table_6</a>). </p>
<p>Almost all (98%) abortions were performed by curettage and
 less than
1% by intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003248.htm">Table_8</a>).
Hysterectomy and hysterotomy were used in only a few cases: less
 than 0.01%
of abortions were performed by using these methods. </p>
<p>Approximately 58% of women who obtained legal induced
 abortions were
white (<a href="00053774.htm#00003249.htm">Table_9</a>). The abortion ratio for black women was 534 per
 1,000
live births; this was approximately 2.5 times the ratio for white
 women
(204 per 1,000 live births). The abortion ratio (335 per 1,000 live
 births)
for women of other races was approximately 1.6 times the ratio for
 white
women. In addition, the abortion rate for black women (31 per
 1,000) was
approximately 2.5 times the rate for white women (12 per 1,000
 women). </p>
<p>Twenty-one states, the District of Columbia, and New York City
 **
reported data concerning the Hispanic ethnicity of women who
 obtained legal
induced abortions (<a href="00053774.htm#00003250.htm">Table_10</a>). The percentage of abortions
 obtained by
Hispanic women in these reporting areas ranged from less than 1% in
 several
states to approximately 44% in New Mexico. For Hispanic women in
 these
reporting areas, the abortion ratio was 265 per 1,000 live births
 --
slightly lower than the ratio for non-Hispanics in the same areas
 (280 per
1,000). However, the abortion rate per 1,000 Hispanic women (20 per
 1,000
women) was greater than the rate per 1,000 non-Hispanic women (15
 per
1,000). </p>
<p>Seventy-nine percent of women who obtained abortions were
 unmarried
(<a href="00053774.htm#00003251.htm">Table_11</a>). The abortion ratio for unmarried women was
 approximately
nine times the ratio for married women (650 versus 76 abortions per
 1,000
live births). </p>
<p>Approximately 45% of women who obtained legal induced
 abortions had
had no previous live births, and approximately 89% had had two or
 fewer
previous live births (<a href="00053774.htm#00003252.htm">Table_12</a>). The abortion ratio was highest
 for
women who had had three previous live births and lowest for women
 who had
had one previous live birth. </p>
<p>In 1995, of women who obtained an abortion, 54% of women
 obtained an
abortion for the first time. Approximately 17% of women had had at
 least
two previous abortions (<a href="00053774.htm#00003253.htm">Table_13</a>). </p>
<p>The age distribution of women who obtained a legal abortion
 differed
slightly by race (<a href="00053774.htm#00003254.htm">Table_14</a>). However, for women of black or
 other
races, the percentage who were aged less than 15 years, although
 small
(1.1%), was nearly twice the percentage for white women (0.6%). The

percentage of women of black or other races who were unmarried
 (83%) also
was slightly higher than the percentage of white women (78%). Few
differences were found by age and Hispanic ethnicity
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003255.htm">Table_15</a>). Of
those women who had obtained an abortion, a slightly higher
 percentage of
non-Hispanic women were unmarried in comparison with Hispanic
 women. </p>
<p>Most (approximately 86%) women who obtained an abortion had
 their
procedure during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy; however,
 adolescents
(i.e., women aged less than or equal to 19 years) were more likely
 than
older women to obtain abortions later in pregnancy (<a href="00053774.htm#00003256.htm">Table_16</a>
 and
<a href="00053774.htm#00003257.htm">Table_17</a>). The percentage of women who obtained an abortion
 early in
pregnancy (i.e., at less than or equal to 8 weeks of gestation)
 increased
with age, and the percentage who obtained an abortion late in
 pregnancy (at
greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation) decreased with age
 for
women up to 25-29 years of age and remained stable for women in
 older age
groups (<a href="00053774.htm#00001736.gif">Figure_5</a>; <a href="00053774.htm#00003256.htm">Table_16</a>). Black women were more likely
 to obtain
an abortion later in pregnancy than were white women or women of
 other
races (<a href="00053774.htm#00003256.htm">Table_16</a> and <a href="00053774.htm#00003257.htm">Table_17</a>). Of all women who obtained an

abortion, Hispanic women were slightly more likely than
 non-Hispanic women
to have had an abortion at less than or equal to 8 weeks of
 gestation and
less likely to have had an abortion late in pregnancy (greater than
 or
equal to 21 weeks), the overall differences between Hispanic and
non-Hispanic women in the timing of abortions were minimal
 (<a href="00053774.htm#00003256.htm">Table_16</a>). </p>
<p>More than 99% of abortions at less than or equal to 12 weeks
 of
gestation were performed by using curettage (primarily suction
 procedures)
(<a href="00053774.htm#00003258.htm">Table_18</a>). After 12 weeks of gestation, the most frequently
 used
procedure also was curettage, although it usually was reported as
dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Intrauterine instillations
 involved the
use of saline or prostaglandin; these procedures were used
 primarily at
greater than or equal to 16 weeks of gestation. </p>
<p>DISCUSSION </p>
<p>Since 1990 (i.e., the year in which the number of abortions
 was
highest), the annual number of abortions in the United States has
 decreased
by 15% (<a href="00053774.htm#00003242.htm">Table_2</a>) (2,4). In 1995, the national
 abortion-to-live-birth
ratio was the lowest recorded since 1975 (5). The abortion ratio
 had
increased steadily from 1970 through 1980, decreased slightly
 during
1981-1983, increased to its highest level in 1984, then remained
 fairly
stable until 1987, before beginning to decline each subsequent year

(<a href="00053774.htm#00003242.htm">Table_2</a>; <a href="00053774.htm#00001730.gif">Figure_1</a>). The decreasing abortion ratio resulted
 from a
lower proportion of pregnant women who had obtained an abortion in
 recent
years. Factors that may contribute to this effect include
 attitudinal
changes concerning abortion and/or carrying unplanned pregnancies
 to term
and the decreased number of unintended pregnancies in recent years
 (6). </p>
<p>In addition, in 1995, the national abortion rate was the
 lowest
recorded since 1975 (5). This decline in the abortion rate probably

reflects the decreasing rate of unintended pregnancies; reduced
 access to
abortion services; and changes in contraceptive practices,
 including an
increased use of contraception, particularly an increased use of
 condoms
among young women (6-9). In this report, the induced abortion rate
 in the
United States was higher than rates reported for Australia and
 Western
European countries and lower than rates reported for China, Cuba,
 Eastern
European countries, and the Newly Independent States of the former
 Soviet
Union (10). Also, a recent study from Canada for 1995 reported a
 legal
induced abortion rate that was approximately 26% lower than the
 rate in the
United States (15.5 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years
 versus 21
per 1,000, respectively) and an abortion-to-live-birth ratio
 approximately
12% lower than the ratio in the United States (282 per 1,000 live
 births
versus 321 per 1,000, respectively) (11). Abortion and birth rates
 for
teenagers are higher in the United States than in most Western
 European
countries and some Eastern European countries (12). </p>
<p>As in previous years, the abortion ratio in 1995 varied
 substantially
by age (2). Although the ratio was highest for adolescents, the
 percentage
of legal induced abortions obtained by women aged less than or
 equal to 19
years has decreased since the mid-1980s (i.e., from 26% in 1984 to
 22% in
1990 and to 20% in 1992) and has remained at that level (4,13).
 Since 1980,
the abortion ratio has declined for most age groups -- particularly
 for
those at the age extremes -- women aged less than or equal to 19
 years and
greater than or equal to 35 years. In 1995, the abortion ratio for
adolescents (i.e., aged less than 15 and 15-19 years) was the
 lowest ratio
CDC had ever recorded for these age groups. Other studies have
 indicated a
decrease in teenage pregnancies from 1992 to 1995 and a decrease in
 teenage
birth rates from 1994 to 1995 (3,14). </p>
<p>Several factors may have influenced this decline in the
 abortion
ratios among adolescents. First, teenage pregnancies decreased;
 therefore,
abortions decreased. Second, the age distribution of
 reproductive-aged
women obtaining abortions shifted from younger women to older, less
 fertile
women (15). Third, access to abortion services changed (7-8), and
 abortion
laws that affect adolescents (e.g., parental consent or
 notification laws
and mandatory waiting periods) have undergone continual change
 (16-18). </p>
<p>In 1995, as in previous years, the abortion ratio for black
 women was
approximately twice the ratio for white women; this differential
 has
increased since 1986. In addition, the abortion rate for black
 women was
approximately 2.5 times the rate for white women. Race-specific
 differences
in legal induced abortion ratios and rates may reflect differences
 in
factors such as socioeconomic status, contraceptive use, incidence
 of
unintended pregnancies, and access to family-planning and
 contraceptive
services. </p>
<p>The abortion-to-live-birth ratio for Hispanic women during
 1995 was
slightly lower than that for non-Hispanic women. Other published
 reports
indicate that pregnant Hispanic women are less likely than pregnant

non-Hispanic women to obtain an abortion (19). However, the
 abortion rate
per 1,000 Hispanic women was higher than the rate for non-Hispanic
 women,
which is consistent with several other studies (19-20). For women
 in all
age groups, fertility was higher for Hispanic than for non-Hispanic
 women
(3). </p>
<p>In 1995, a total of 36 states, including the District of
 Columbia and
New York City, reported Hispanic ethnicity of women who obtained
 abortions.
Because of concerns regarding the completeness of such information
 (greater
than 15% unknown data) regarding Hispanic ethnicity in some states,
 data
from only 21 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City
 were
evaluated to determine the number and percentage of abortions
 obtained by
women of Hispanic ethnicity in 1995. These geographical areas
 represent
approximately 38% of all reproductive-aged Hispanic women in the
 United
States in 1995 (CDC, unpublished data). One published report of a
 study
that used abortion data obtained from CDC also suggests that the
 number of
Hispanics obtaining abortions may be underestimated (20). Thus, the
 number,
ratio, and rate of abortions for Hispanic women in this report
 might not be
representative of the overall Hispanic population in the United
 States
(i.e., these data might reflect utilization of abortion services
 only in
the areas included in this analysis). </p>
<p>Since 1980, the percentage distribution of abortions by
 gestational
age has been stable, with slight percentage increases toward the
 earliest
and latest gestational ages and slight percentage decreases for
 abortions
performed at 8, 9-10, and 11-12 weeks. Since 1990, there has been
 an
increase in the percentage of abortions performed at the early
 weeks of
gestation (i.e., less than or equal to 6 and 7 weeks). Recently,
 there has
been an increased interest in surveillance for abortions performed
 late in
pregnancy (i.e., greater than or equal to 21 weeks) (21). </p>
<p>Since 1992, most reporting areas have reported abortions by
gestational age, in weeks of gestation, for abortions performed at
 less
than or equal to 6, 7, and 8 weeks (2). These data will assist in
monitoring trends in legal abortions as new medical (nonsurgical)
 methods
of terminating pregnancy are implemented because these new methods
 are used
primarily to terminate pregnancies at less than or equal to 8 weeks
 of
gestation (22-25). During 1994-1995, approximately 2,000 women in
 the
United States aged greater than 18 years participated in clinical
 trials
testing mifepristone, a medication used for medical (nonsurgical)
 abortion
(26). This medication has not yet been fully approved by the Food
 and Drug
Administration for use and distribution in the United States
 (Population
Council, personal communication, 1998). However, other medications
 (e.g.,
methotrexate and misoprostol) are currently being used to perform
 early
medical (nonsurgical) abortions (24-25). </p>
<p>In this and previous reports, age was inversely associated
 with timing
of abortion (2,27,28). As in previous years, younger women were
 more likely
to obtain an abortion later in gestation than were older women. </p>
<p>From 1972 to 1995, the percentage of abortions performed by
 curettage
(which includes D&amp;E) increased from 89% to 99% (<a href="00053774.htm#00003241.htm">Table_1</a>), and
 the
percentage of abortions performed by intrauterine instillation and
 by
hysterectomy and hysterotomy declined sharply (from 10% to 0.5% and
 from
0.6% to less than 0.01%, respectively). From 1974 through 1995, the

percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by D&amp;E increased
 from
31% to 94%; the percentage of second-trimester abortions performed
 by
intrauterine instillation decreased from 57% to 4% (29). The
 continued
reliance on D&amp;E probably has resulted from the lower risk for
 complications
associated with the procedure (30,31). </p>
<p>The numbers, ratios, and rates of abortion from this analysis
 are
conservative estimates because the numbers of legal abortions
 reported to
CDC for 1995 were probably lower than the numbers actually
 performed.
Totals provided by central health agencies may be lower than those
 obtained
by direct surveys of abortion providers (32). For example, the
 total number
of abortions reported to CDC for 1992 was approximately 11% lower
 than that
reported for 1992 *** by The Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private
organization that directly contacts abortion providers to obtain
information concerning the total number of abortions performed (8).
 In
addition, not all states collected and/or reported information
 (e.g., age,
race, and gestational age) concerning women obtaining a legal
 induced
abortion during 1995; therefore, the numbers, percentages, rates,
 and
ratios derived from this analysis may not be representative of all
 women
who obtained abortions in that year. </p>
<p>Despite these limitations, findings from ongoing national
 surveillance
for legal induced abortion are used for several purposes. First,
 data from
abortion surveillance are used to identify characteristics of women
 at high
risk for unintended pregnancy. Second, ongoing annual surveillance
 is
essential to monitor trends in the number, ratio, and rate of
 abortions in
the United States. Third, statistics on the number of pregnancies
 ending in
abortion are used in conjunction with birth and fetal death
 statistics to
estimate pregnancy rates (e.g., pregnancy rates among teenagers)
 (1) and
other outcome rates (e.g., the rate of ectopic pregnancies per
 1,000
pregnancies). Fourth, abortion and pregnancy rates can be used to
 evaluate
the effectiveness of family-planning programs and programs for
 preventing
unintended pregnancy. Fifth, ongoing surveillance provides data for

assessing changes in clinical practice patterns related to abortion
 (e.g.,
longitudinal changes in the types of procedures and trends in
 gestational
age at the time of abortion). Finally, abortion data are used as
 the
denominator in calculating abortion morbidity and mortality rates
 (2). </p>
<p>Induced abortions usually are linked to unintended
 pregnancies, which
often occur despite use of contraception (20,33,34). In 1995, data
 from the
National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) indicated that
 approximately 31% of
live births were associated with unintended pregnancy (i.e., either

mistimed or unwanted at conception) (6). Unintended pregnancy is
 not a
problem just for adolescents, unmarried women, or for poor women;
 it is a
pervasive public health problem that spans all groups of women (6).
 </p>
<p>In a study of abortion patients conducted during 1994 and
 1995,
researchers found that 58% of patients reported that they
 &quot;currently used&quot;
contraception during the month of their last menstrual period;
 however,
their use of contraception may have been inconsistent or incorrect
 (20).
Researchers conducting the most recent NSFG have estimated that in
 1995,
approximately 29% of U.S. women who used oral contraceptives as
 their only
contraception and who had intercourse during the 3 months before
 their NSFG
interview reported that they missed a birth control pill one or
 more times
during the 3 months. In addition, approximately 33% of U.S. women
 who were
using only coitus-dependent contraceptive methods **** during the 3
 months
before the interview used these methods inconsistently (6).
 Therefore,
education regarding improved contraceptive use and practices, as
 well as
access to and education regarding safe, effective, and low-cost
contraception and family-planning services, may help reduce the
 incidence
of unintended pregnancy and, therefore, may reduce the use of legal
 induced
abortion in the United States (35,36). </p>
<p>Recently passed welfare-reform legislation -- the Personal
Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
 ***** -- has
increased the interest in accurate state-based surveillance for
 induced
abortion. In addition, some states have recently instituted
 programs that
emphasize the prevention of unintended pregnancy, particularly
 among
adolescents. To help guide these efforts, an ongoing, accurate
 assessment
of induced abortion is needed in all states to determine the number
 and
characteristics of women who obtain these procedures. </p>
<p>Additional statistical and epidemiologic information about
 legal
induced abortions is available from CDC's automated Reproductive
 Health
Information System. This system provides information by fax, voice
recordings, or mail; telephone (888) 232-2306. Copies of MMWR
 reports
containing statistical and epidemiologic information about
 abortions also
can be obtained through the CDC World-Wide Web site at
