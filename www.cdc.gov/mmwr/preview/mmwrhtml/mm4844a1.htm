<p>During 1996-1998, CDC received reports from approximately 16 state health departments
of <i>Salmonella </i>infections in persons who had direct or indirect contact with
reptiles (i.e., lizards, snakes, or turtles). <i>Salmonella </i>infection can result in
invasive illness including sepsis and meningitis, particularly in infants. Despite
educational efforts, some reptile owners remain unaware that reptiles place them and their
children at risk for salmonellosis. This report summarizes clinical and epidemiologic
information in four cases and provides information about state regulations to prevent
transmission of <i>Salmonella </i>spp. from reptiles to humans.</p>
<b>

<p>Case Reports</p>

<p>Arizona. </b>During October 1996, a 3-week-old boy was admitted to a hospital emergency
department with fever (103.6 F [40 C]), vomiting, and bloody diarrhea of 15 days'
duration. Stool and blood cultures yielded <i>Salmonella </i>serotype IV 44:<sub>z4,z23-</sub>,
an extremely rare serotype. The infant was hospitalized for 10 days and treated with
intravenous fluids and amoxicillin. To determine the cause of the infant's illness, a
stool specimen was obtained from the family's pet iguana, which also yielded <i>Salmonella
</i>IV 44:<sub>z4,z23-</sub>. In an attempt to prevent reinfection, local health officials
informed the parents of the importance of the infant avoiding direct and indirect contact
with the reptile, and the iguana was moved to a relative's home. One month later, the
infant spent 2 days in the relative's home where the iguana was housed; 48 hours after
this visit, the infant was again treated at an emergency department for fever and
diarrhea. A stool culture again yielded <i>Salmonella</i> IV 44:<sub>z4,z23-</sub>.</p>
<b>

<p>Kansas.</b> During April 1997, a 6-year-old boy had bloody diarrhea of 10 days'
duration, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and fever (104.9 F [41 C]). Stool culture yielded <i>Salmonella
</i>serotype Typhimurium. The child was treated with ceftriaxone and
amoxicillin/clavulanate. Nine days after the boy started therapy, his 3-year-old brother
also developed diarrhea, and a stool sample yielded <i>S.</i> Typhimurium. No other family
members became ill. The two boys shared a room with two corn snakes that they handled
regularly. Stool cultures from the corn snakes yielded <i>S.</i> Typhimurium. The parents
reported to health department staff that they were unaware that snakes are a source of
salmonellosis.</p>
<b>

<p>Massachusetts. </b>During May 1997, an 8-year-old boy with a congenital immune
deficiency developed severe vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloody diarrhea, and headaches.
Stool samples yielded <i>Salmonella </i>serotype St. Paul. The boy was ill for 14 days and
received extensive supportive care at home. Three days before the boy became ill, the
family had purchased two iguanas from a local pet store. The family was not informed by
pet store personnel that reptiles are a source of salmonellosis; the child handled the
reptiles, including putting them on his head and face. Before diagnostic testing could be
performed, the reptiles were returned to the pet store. The parents informed the pet store
owner of the child's illness, and the pet store owner reportedly was unaware that reptiles
carry <i>Salmonella </i>spp.</p>
<b>

<p>Wisconsin. </b>In December 1998, a previously healthy 5-month-old boy suddenly died at
home. No significant macroscopic or histologic findings were revealed during autopsy;
however, culture of a heart blood sample yielded <i>Salmonella </i>serotype Marina. The
cause of death was attributed to S. Marina septicemia. The family had a pet iguana that
had not come into direct contact with the infant. Culture of a stool sample taken from the
iguana yielded <i>S.</i> Marina. Based on an interview, the parents were unaware that the
infant was at risk for salmonellosis from indirect or direct contact with the iguana.</p>
<b>

<p>State Regulations for Preventing Reptile-Associated Salmonellosis</p>
</b>

<p>During March 1999, CDC contacted all 50 state health departments to determine whether
state regulations existed for sale of reptiles and distribution of information about
salmonellosis. Of the 48 states that responded, three (California, Connecticut, and
Michigan) had regulations requiring pet stores to provide information about salmonellosis
to persons purchasing a turtle; two states (Kansas and Maryland) require salmonellosis
information to be provided to persons purchasing any reptile. Three states (Arizona,
Minnesota, and Wyoming) prohibit reptiles in day care centers and long-term-care
facilities.</p>

<h3>Editorial Note:</h3>

<p>In the United States, pet turtles were an important source of salmonellosis until
commercial distribution of pet turtles less than 4 inches long was banned in 1975 (1).
This ban led to a 77% reduction in the frequency of turtle-associated <i>Salmonella </i>serotypes
isolated from humans during 1970-1976 (1). The popularity of other reptiles as pets is
growing and has raised concerns about their impact on public health. This and other
reports (2) demonstrate that reptile-related salmonellosis continues to pose a substantial
threat to human health. Approximately 93,000 (7%) cases per year of <i>Salmonella </i>spp.
infections are attributable to pet reptile or amphibian contact (3). An estimated 3% of
households in the United States have a reptile (CDC, unpublished data, 1999). Many
reptiles are colonized with Salmonella spp. and intermittently shed the organism in their
feces (4). Persons become infected by ingesting <i>Salmonella </i>after handling a reptile
or objects contaminated by a reptile and then failing to wash their hands properly. Either
direct or indirect contact with infected reptiles and their environment can cause human
illness (5,6).</p>

<p>Rare <i>Salmonella </i>serotypes, such as Java, Marina, Stanley, Poona, and Chameleon
associated with reptiles, increasingly have been isolated from humans (7) (<a href="mm4844a1.htm#fig1">Figure
1</a>). For example, <i>S.</i> Marina isolates from humans increased from two in 1989 to
47 in 1998, and S. Poona increased from 199 in 1989 to 341 in 1998 (8). Isolation of rare
serotypes of <i>Salmonella </i>spp. can alert public health staff about trends in the
transmission of infection from reptiles to humans.</p>

<p>Most persons who contract reptile-associated salmonellosis are infants and young
children. In 1994, 413 (81%) of 513 <i>S.</i> Marina cases occurred in children aged less
than 1 year, whereas 4301 (14%) of 30,723 reported salmonellosis cases occurred in
children aged less than 1 year (6). During 1989-1998, 516 (24%) of 2150 <i>Salmonella </i>isolates
with reptile-associated serotypes were from children aged less than 4 years, whereas
50,755 (19%) of 267,131 other serotypes were from this age group (CDC, unpublished data,
1999). Because infants and immunocompromised persons are more susceptible to illness, many
reptile-associated <i>Salmonella </i>infections involve serious complications, including
septicemia and meningitis (9).</p>

<p>The risks for transmission of <i>Salmonella </i>spp. from reptiles to humans can be
reduced by thoroughly washing hands with soap and water after handling reptiles or objects
that have been in contact with reptiles and by preventing reptile contact with
food-preparation areas. Children aged less than 5 years and immunocompromised persons
should avoid direct and indirect contact with reptiles. Reptiles also should not be kept
in homes of persons with children aged less than 1 year and in child care facilities (see
box). All pet store personnel and reptile owners should be aware that reptiles can carry
and transmit <i>Salmonella </i>spp. Pet stores are in a unique position to educate
consumers because reptile owners obtain most of their information about their pet from pet
store personnel. CDC and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council (PIJAC) have developed
educational posters and brochures for use by veterinarians and pet stores on safe pet
reptile handling.*</p>

<p>The effectiveness of educating the public about reptile-associated salmonellosis needs
to be evaluated. To enhance efforts to educate the public in a systematic, consistent, and
timely manner, the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians and the
Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists jointly recommend &quot;that the
appropriate state and local agencies enact legislation prohibiting the sale or gift of
reptiles unless there is written point-of-sale education provided to consumers on the
risks for and prevention of reptile-associated salmonellosis&quot; (10). CDC will provide
assistance to states interested in developing point-of-sale educational material; however,
if these educational efforts should prove unsuccessful, states may wish to adopt
restrictions for the sale of reptiles similar to those for turtles.</p>

<p>Recommendations for Preventing Transmission of Salmonella from Reptiles to Humans

<ul>
  </b>
  <li>Pet store owners, veterinarians, and pediatricians should provide information to owners
    and potential purchasers of reptiles about the risk for acquiring salmonellosis from
    reptiles.</li>
  <li>Persons should always wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water after handling
    reptiles or reptile cages.</li>
  <li>Persons at increased risk for infection or serious complications of salmonellosis (e.g.,
    children aged less than 5 years and immunocompromised persons) should avoid contact with
    reptiles.</li>
  <li>Pet reptiles should be kept out of households where children aged less than 1 year and
    immunocompromised persons live. Families expecting a new child should remove the pet
    reptile from the home before the infant arrives.</li>
  <li>Pet reptiles should not be kept in child care centers.</li>
  <li>Pet reptiles should not be allowed to roam freely throughout the home or living area.</li>
  <li>Pet reptiles should be kept out of kitchens and other food-preparation areas to prevent
    contamination. Kitchen sinks should not be used to bathe reptiles or to wash their dishes,
    cages, or aquariums. If bathtubs are used for these purposes, they should be cleaned
    thoroughly and disinfected with bleach.</li>
</ul>
