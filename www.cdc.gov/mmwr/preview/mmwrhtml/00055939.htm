<h1>Lead Poisoning Associated with Imported Candy and Powdered Food
Coloring -- California and Michigan </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Although the most common source of pediatric lead poisoning is

dust within the home that contains deteriorated lead-based paint
from walls and windowsills, other less common sources (1-3) can
result in excess exposure among children (i.e., blood lead levels
{BLLs} greater than or equal to 10 ug/dL). This report describes
two cases of pediatric lead poisoning associated with eating
imported candy and food stuffs and underscores the importance of
thorough history-taking to identify unusual sources of lead
exposure.
Case 1 </p>
<p>In 1993, a 6-year-old boy in California was identified by
routine screening during a well-child examination as having a BLL
of 59 ug/dL. During 1993-1997, he underwent chelation therapy seven

times to reduce his BLL. His five siblings, ranging in age from 11
to 17 years, also were tested within 9 months of their brother and
had BLLs of 35-46 ug/dL; the mother had a BLL of 26 ug/dL. In 1995,

two cousins, aged 3 and 7 years, were identified with BLLs of 50
ug/dL and 57 ug/dL, respectively. In addition, a ninth child (a
niece of the index case patient) was born in 1996 and had a BLL of
26 ug/dL at age 1 year. </p>
<p>No potential source of exposure was identified for the
children and mother. However, on review of serial BLLs, elevations
coincided with the return of the maternal aunt from visits to
Mexico. </p>
<p>In 1997, repeated questioning of family members revealed that
the aunt had transported in her personal baggage tamarindo candy
jam products, produced in Mexico and restricted from importation
into the United States since 1993, and had given it to the
children. Although the family had been cautioned about the
ingestion of ethnic remedies, they were unaware of the potential
dangers of ingesting candy packaged in ceramic jars from Mexico. </p>
<p>No product was available from the family for analysis. The
California Department of Health Services issued a health alert on
April 3, 1998, warning consumers to avoid eating these products. In

addition, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated
administrative actions to prevent future importation of these
products into the United States (4).
Case 2 </p>
<p>In May 1997, a 3-year-old boy in Michigan had a BLL of 27
ug/dL. His 2-year-old brother had a BLL of 36 ug/dL. Subsequently,
their home was cleaned professionally with a trisodium phosphate
solution and a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter
vacuum; interior dust samples were found negative for lead. Despite

extensive history-taking and several environmental investigations
of both the home and the father's workplace, no source of lead was
determined. </p>
<p>By January 1998, the two brothers and both parents had BLLs of

50 ug/dL to 60 ug/dL. The brothers' BLLs increased after chelation
therapy. In April 1998, samples of household spices were analyzed;
no significant lead levels were found in any spice except lozeena,
a bright orange powder used by Iraqis to color rice and meat, which

contained 7.8%-8.9% lead. </p>
<p>Nine of 18 extended family members subsequently tested had
elevated BLLs ranging from 25 ug/dL to 84 ug/dL. Elevated BLLs were

found only among maternal relatives who had eaten food prepared
with a single supply of lozeena. The lozeena had been purchased in
Iraq and brought into the United States by the maternal
grandmother. The contaminated lozeena was removed from the affected

households, and the family was encouraged to destroy any frozen
foods made with this supply of lozeena. </p>
<p>Customs officials were notified about the possibility of
travelers bringing contaminated lozeena into the United States from

Iraq. Educational materials were translated into Arabic, and health

alerts were sent to local physicians. The Oakland County Health
Department screened 212 persons in the community for lead, and no
other elevated BLLs were identified. </p>

<p>Editorial Note: Because lead poisoning in children can result from
multiple sources, successful case management requires a systematic
review of all potential sources of lead exposure. This review
includes thorough history-taking and home inspection to prevent
further lead exposure or clinical lead poisoning and to avoid
increased lead absorption should chelation therapy be required. </p>
<p>When a child's BLLs are persistently elevated and
case-management efforts fail to identify a source, screening other
members of the index household for blood lead should be considered.

Detecting excess lead exposure in more than one family member of
the same household can be important to directing the investigation
toward a shared source of exposure. Blood from other household
contacts, extended family, or visitors that may regularly share
this exposure source also should be screened for lead. </p>
<p>Several commercial retail lots of the tamarindo jellied fruit
candy were embargoed by California in 1993 because of high lead
levels in the product. The tamarindo products still are being sold
in California through ethnic markets, swap meets, and itinerant
vendors. Persons frequently bring these products into the United
States in small quantities while traveling from Mexico. These
products can be found under the brand names Margarita-brand
Tamarindo Pulpa (with and without chili), Licona-imported
Tamarindo, Picarindo-brand jellied tamarindo candy, and Jarrita
Chonita-brand jellied tejocote candy with chili. All four
fruit-derived products are packaged in stoneware or terra cotta
ceramic jars. The lead-based glazing applied to the jars appears to

be the major source of lead in these products. Improperly fired
lead-glazed pottery is a well-known source of food adulteration
(1,3,5). Candied jam in green jars had the highest lead levels.
Both tamarindo and tejocote fruits are acidic, which increases lead

leaching. However, some jams from plastic-lined jars contain
substantial amounts of lead and may have been contaminated with
lead from another source. Chili, an ingredient in some of these
products, can be contaminated by lead through the practice of
air-drying or fuel-assisted drying in Mexico, where leaded gasoline

is used as fuel (R. Jacobs, PhD, FDA, San Francisco District
Office, personal communication, 1998). </p>
<p>FDA recommends a 6-ug per day tolerable limit for dietary
intake of lead for children aged less than 6 years to prevent the
more subtle adverse neurologic and behavioral effects of lead
exposure (6). A typical serving of 60 g of the tejocote product
could expose a child to 6.7-1956.0 ug of lead; the same serving of
the tamarindo products would provide 11.4-36.0 ug of lead. </p>
<p>Spices occasionally have been implicated as lead sources in
other countries (T. Venkatesh, St. Johns Medical College,
Bangalore, India, personal communication, 1998). Lead is sometimes
added to certain ethnic foods or food supplements to impart a
yellow or orange color or a sweet taste or to increase weight (7). </p>
