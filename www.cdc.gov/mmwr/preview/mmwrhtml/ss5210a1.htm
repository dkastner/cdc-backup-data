      <P></P>
      <P><B>Problem/Condition:</B> Lead is neurotoxic and particularly harmful 
      to the developing nervous systems of fetuses and young children. Extremely 
      high blood lead levels (BLLs) (i.e., <U>&gt;</U>70 µg/dL) can cause severe 
      neurologic problems (e.g., seizure, coma, and death). However, no 
      threshold has been determined regarding lead's harmful effects on 
      children's learning and behavior. In 1990, the U.S. Department of Health 
      and Human Services established a national goal to eliminate BLLs &gt;25 
      µg/dL by 2000; a new goal targets elimination of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL 
      in children aged &lt;6 years by 2010. </P>
      <P><B>Reporting Period:</B> Information regarding children's BLLs comes 
      from 1) National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 
      conducted during 1976--1980, 1988--1991, 1991--1994, and 1999--2000; and 
      2) state child blood lead surveillance data for test results collected 
      during 1997--2001. </P>
      <P>Description of System: CDC tracks children's BLLs in the United States 
      by using both NHANES and state and local surveillance data. NHANES reports 
      data regarding children aged 1--5 years; state and local surveillance 
      systems report data regarding children aged &lt;72 months. Because lead 
      exposure in children varies among populations and communities, both 
      surveys are needed to determine the burden of elevated BLLs among young 
      children throughout the United States. NHANES uses highly standardized 
      data-collection procedures and probability samples to gather information 
      regarding the health and nutritional status of the civilian, 
      noninstitutionalized U.S. population. State and local childhood lead 
      surveillance systems are based on reports of blood lead tests from 
      laboratories. State and local programs submit data to CDC annually. In 
      this report, confirmed elevated BLLs are defined as one venous blood 
      specimen <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL or two capillary blood specimens 
      <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL drawn within 12 weeks of each other. </P>
      <P><B>Results:</B> The NHANES 1999--2000 survey estimated that 434,000 
      children (95% confidence interval = 189,000--846,000) or 2.2% of children 
      aged 1--5 years had BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL. For 2001, a total of 44 
      states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City (NYC) submitted 
      child blood lead surveillance data to CDC. These jurisdictions represent 
      95% of the U.S. population of children aged &lt;72 months and 97% of the 
      nation's pre-1950 housing. The number of children tested and reported to 
      CDC increased from 1,703,356 in 1997 (37 states, DC, and NYC reporting), 
      to 2,422,298 in 2001 (44 states, DC, and NYC reporting). During that time, 
      the number of children reported with confirmed elevated BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 
      µg/dL steadily decreased from 130,512 in 1997 to 74,887 in 2001. In 2000, 
      the year targeted for national elimination of BLLs &gt;25 µg/dL, a total 
      of 8,723 children had BLLs <U>&gt;</U>25 µg/dL. </P>
      <P><B>Interpretation:</B> Both national surveys and state surveillance 
      data indicate children's BLLs continue to decline throughout the United 
      States. However, thousands of children continue to be identified with 
      elevated BLLs. The 2000 goal of eliminating BLLs &gt;25 µg/dL was not met. 
      Attaining the 2010 goal of eliminating BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL will 
      require intensified efforts to target areas at highest risk, evaluate 
      preventive measures, and improve the quality of surveillance data. </P>
      <P><B>Public Health Actions:</B> States will continue to use surveillance 
      data to 1) promote legislation supporting lead poisoning prevention 
      activities, 2) obtain funding, 3) identify risk groups, 4) target and 
      evaluate prevention activities, and 5) monitor and describe progress 
      toward elimination of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL. CDC will work with state 
      and local programs to improve tracking systems and the collection, 
      timeliness, and quality of surveillance data. 
      <H3 align=center><B><FONT color=#0b3d91>Introduction</FONT></B> </H3>
      <P></P>
      <P>Exposure to lead can damage the nervous, hematopoietic, and renal 
      systems (<I>1,2</I>) and is particularly harmful to the developing nervous 
      systems of fetuses and children aged &lt;72 months. Extremely elevated 
      blood lead levels (BLLs) <U>&gt;</U>70 µg/dL can cause severe neurologic 
      problems (e.g., seizure, coma, and death) (<I>3</I>). Although severe 
      cases are rare today (<I>4</I>), the threshold for harmful effects of lead 
      remains unknown. Since 1975, as new data became available, CDC has revised 
      its recommendations regarding the threshold of BLLs that should raise 
      concern and trigger interventions (<I>5--7</I>). By 1991, CDC had lowered 
      the BLL threshold 66.6% to 10 µg/dL, from 30 µg/dL in 1975 (<I>5,7</I>), 
      in response to studies in the late 1980s that linked BLLs as low as 10 
      µg/dL with decreased intelligence and other adverse neurodevelopmental 
      effects (<I>8--11</I>). Ongoing research conducted since 1991 provides 
      evidence of adverse effects at even lower levels, &lt;10 µg/dL, among 
      children aged &lt;72 months (<I>12--16</I>). </P>
      <P>The principal sources of lead exposure for children in the United 
      States are house dust contaminated by leaded paint and soil contaminated 
      by both leaded paint and decades of industrial and motor vehicle emissions 
      (<I>1</I>). Lead was widely used in paint through the 1940s. Although lead 
      use declined during the 1950s and 1960s (<I>17</I>), and lead was banned 
      from residential use in 1978*, lead remains a hazard in homes built before 
      the ban, especially in pre-1950 housing. During 1991--1994, CDC's National 
      Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) determined the prevalence 
      of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL was highest among children living in pre-1946 
      homes (8.6%), compared with children living in homes built during 
      1946--1973 (4.6%), and after 1973 (1.6%). Among children living in 
      pre-1946 housing, prevalence of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL differed 
      substantially by family income. Prevalence among children from low-income 
      families was 16.4%, compared with 4.1% and 0.9% among children from 
      middle- and high-income families (<I>18</I>). 
      <H4><B>National Elimination Goals</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) established a 
      national goal to eliminate BLLs &gt;25 µg/dL in children aged 6 months--5 
      years by 2000. This goal was announced in September 1990 in <I>Healthy 
      People 2000</I> (<I>19</I>). The next year, the U.S. Public Health Service 
      released its Strategic Plan for the Elimination of Childhood Lead 
      Poisoning (<I>20</I>). The plan called for a societywide effort to 
      eliminate lead poisoning as a public health problem by 2011. Lead 
      poisoning was defined as BLLs <U>&gt;</U>25 µg/dL, but the plan noted CDC 
      was considering lowering that level. The plan called for 1) more childhood 
      lead poisoning prevention programs and activities; 2) effective abatement 
      of leaded paint and leaded paint-contaminated dust in housing; 3) 
      continued reduction of children's exposure to lead in the environment; and 
      4) establishment of nationwide surveillance for children with elevated 
      BLLs. </P>
      <P>By the end of the 1990s, a new <I>Healthy People 2010</I> target had 
      been established to eliminate BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL among children aged 
      1--5 years by 2010 (<I>21</I>). The baseline data used to monitor progress 
      toward this target are provided by NHANES, which provides nationally 
      representative and comparable estimates for monitoring trends but cannot 
      determine local variations in the risk for elevated BLLs (<I><a href="mm4950a3.htm">22</a>,23</I>). 
      Therefore, state and local data are necessary to develop effective 
      prevention measures and monitor their progress toward elimination of 
      elevated BLLs. 
      <H4><B>Prevention Programs Established</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>CDC funds state and local programs to develop childhood lead poisoning 
      prevention programs and surveillance activities. The objectives of these 
      childhood lead poisoning prevention programs (CLPPPs) are to 1) screen 
      infants and children for elevated BLLs; 2) ensure that lead-poisoned 
      infants and children are referred for medical and environmental 
      intervention; 3) educate the public and health-care providers regarding 
      childhood lead poisoning; and 4) implement prevention measures to reduce 
      children's exposure to lead. </P>
      <P>Before child lead screening programs, neurologic findings associated 
      with acute encephalopathy were often the first signs of lead poisoning, 
      and children with these symptoms required immediate hospitalization and 
      treatment (<I>24</I>). Because symptoms are rare at BLLs &lt;70 µg/dL, 
      blood lead screening is necessary to identify asymptomatic children with 
      elevated BLLs. Therefore, in 1991, CDC recommended universal screening of 
      children aged 12--72 months. However, a 1994 national survey reported that 
      only one fourth of young children had been screened, including fewer than 
      one third of those at increased risk (e.g., because of poverty or 
      residence in older housing) (<I>25</I>). In addition, certain populations 
      of children were determined to be heavily exposed, whereas others were 
      only minimally exposed (<I>26</I>), depending on risk factors such as 
      poverty level and housing. Consequently, in 1997, CDC recommended that 
      states use data to develop plans to increase screening and follow-up care 
      for children who most need these services. In the absence of a statewide 
      plan or other formal guidance from health officials, universal screening 
      for all young children was still recommended (<I>27</I>). </P>
      <P>This report describes national trends in children's BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 
      µg/dL obtained by using data from NHANES surveys (i.e., 1976--1980, 
      1988--1991, 1991--1994 and 1999--2000) and state data collected by the 
      state Child Blood Lead Surveillance (CBLS) system during 1997--2001. Also 
      described is the distribution of pre-1950 housing existing in the United 
      States in 2000. 
      <H3 align=center><B><FONT color=#0b3d91>Methods</FONT></B> </H3>
      <H4><B>National Surveys</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>Since the 1970s, the extent of human lead exposure has been assessed in 
      the United States by using NHANES, a series of cross-sectional, nationally 
      representative examination surveys conducted by CDC's National Center for 
      Health Statistics. NHANES data indicate distribution of BLLs among the 
      national population, not at state or local levels. Each survey is a 
      stratified, multistage, cluster sample of households with a target 
      population of civilian, noninstitutionalized residents of the United 
      States (<I>28</I>). The surveys include a household interview and a 
      standardized physical examination conducted in a mobile examination 
      center. This report includes results from the first two years (1999--2000) 
      of the current NHANES, as well as previous results from NHANES II 
      (1976--1980), NHANES III, Phase 1 (1988--1991) and NHANES III, Phase 2 
      (1991--1994). </P>
      <P>As part of the NHANES physical examination, a 1 mL sample of 
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-anticoagulated whole blood was obtained by 
      venipuncture from children aged 1--5 years. Blood specimens were frozen 
      and shipped for analysis from the survey sites to the NHANES Laboratory, 
      Division of Environmental Health Laboratory Sciences, National Center for 
      Environmental Health, CDC, Alanta, Georgia. All analyses of BLLs were 
      performed at CDC's NHANES Laboratory. The laboratory methods, including 
      quality control and assurance procedures, have been described previously 
      (<I>29,30</I>). Comparability has also been established for the method 
      used in NHANES II (i.e., modified Delves cup) and that used in NHANES III 
      and the current NHANES (i.e., graphite furnace atomic absorption 
      spectrophotometry). In all surveys, blood lead measurements were 
      calibrated by using standards obtained from the National Institute of 
      Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland. 
      <H4><B>State and Local Surveillance</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>State and local childhood blood lead surveillance systems are based on 
      the results of blood lead tests of children aged &lt;72 months reported to 
      state health departments by private and state and local government 
      laboratories. Reporting criteria, such as the level that should be 
      reported and who should report, are set by each state and vary across 
      jurisdictions. In addition to funding multiple state programs, CDC also 
      funds certain city and county programs that forward surveillance data to 
      state health departments. Test results, which are compiled and analyzed by 
      state health departments and submitted annually to CDC, comprise the CBLS 
      database. </P>
      <P>In conjunction with staff from participating states, CDC staff 
      developed core data variables to be collected for every child tested. 
      These variables include identification and demographic information (e.g., 
      date of birth, race, or ethnicity), laboratory information (e.g., venous 
      or capillary blood specimen), date of specimen collection, and test 
      result. Individual identifiers are stripped from the records, but each 
      child is assigned a unique identifier that is sent to CDC along with the 
      data. To assist CLPPPs with tracking the care of children with elevated 
      BLLs, CDC developed a computer software program, Systematic Tracking of 
      Elevated Lead Levels and Remediation (STELLAR). Certain states use 
      STELLAR; others have developed their own programs. </P>
      <P>CDC checks each state-submitted record for correct formatting and 
      coding and inconsistent values. Records not meeting CDC criteria are 
      summarized in error reports that are sent to states for correction. 
      Certain errors, if not corrected, prevent the record from being entered in 
      CDC's CBLS database. A common error is an illogical sequence of dates on a 
      laboratory record (i.e., date of test analysis is earlier than date blood 
      was drawn). 
      <H4><B>Analysis</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>In this report, state surveillance data are presented for children aged 
      &lt;72 months who were tested for lead at least once during 1997--2001. 
      The following surveillance definitions are used for all states: </P>
      <P><B>Test:</B> Any BLL sample (i.e., capillary, venous, or unknown type) 
      that produces a quantifiable result and is analyzed by a Clinical 
      Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified facility or an approved 
      portable device. Blood for a lead test can be collected for screening, 
      confirmation, or follow-up. </P>
      <P><B>Screening test:</B> A blood lead test for a child aged &lt;72 months 
      who has not had a previously confirmed elevated BLL. A child screened in 
      multiple years or even multiple times within a given year is counted only 
      once for each year. </P>
      <P><B>Confirmed elevated BLL:</B> A child with one venous blood specimen 
      <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL or two capillary blood specimens <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL 
      drawn within 12 weeks of each other (<I>31,32</I>). </P>
      <P>CLPPPs check for duplicate laboratory reports for children and assign a 
      unique identifier for each child before sending the data to CDC. Children 
      with confirmed elevated BLLs who subsequently have another elevated test 
      result, regardless of test type, are included in the tables only once for 
      each year they had an elevated BLL test result. In subsequent years, 
      children with previously confirmed elevated BLLs but no follow-up tests, 
      or only follow-up tests with BLLs &lt;10 µg/dL, are not counted for those 
      subsequent years. </P>
      <P>We assign children with confirmed elevated BLLs into six BLL groups 
      with program relevance (i.e., <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL to &lt;15, <U>&gt;</U>15 
      to &lt;20, <U>&gt;</U>20 to &lt;25, <U>&gt;</U>25 to &lt;45, <U>&gt;</U>45 
      to &lt;70, and <U>&gt;</U>70). The majority of states initiate follow-up 
      testing at BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL and environmental investigations at 
      either <U>&gt;</U>20 µg/dL or persistent BLLs 15--19 µg/dL; chelation is 
      recommended for children with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>45 µg/dL; and BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>70 µg/dL represent a medical emergency. These analyses are also 
      categorized by state, race or ethnicity, sex, and age group. </P>
      <P>To assess the extent of testing among children using Medicaid services, 
      a low-income group at high risk for elevated BLLs (<I>33</I>), state and 
      local health departments collaborate with their Medicaid agencies to link 
      blood lead surveillance data with Medicaid data. This report presents data 
      regarding which state and local CLPPPs link surveillance and Medicaid 
      data. </P>
      <P>Population data in this report were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of 
      the Census. For each year, population data are only included for states 
      with reported surveillance data. Population data used include intercensal 
      population estimates for 1997--1999, the 2000 census, and postcensal 
      estimates for 2001. </P>
      <P>Statistical analyses for NHANES were performed with SAS software 
      (<I>34</I>) and SUDAAN<SUP>®</SUP> (<I>35</I>), a software package that 
      incorporates sample weights and adjusts analyses for the complex sample 
      design of the survey. Survey sample weights were used in all analyses to 
      produce estimates representative of the noninstitutionalized, civilian 
      U.S. population. Analyses of the state surveillance data used SAS.

      <H4><B>National Surveys</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>The prevalence of BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL in children aged 1--5 years 
      living in the United States has continued to decline from an estimated 
      88.2% during the 1976--1980 NHANES II survey (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig1">Figure 
      1</A>). In 1999--2000, the prevalence estimate was 2.2% (95% confidence 
      interval [CI] = 1.0%--4.3%) (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab1">Table 
      1</A>). By applying that prevalence to the U.S. population of children in 
      this age group, we estimated that 434,000 (95% CI = 189,000--846,000) 
      children aged 1--5 years had elevated BLLs. However, because of low 
      prevalence of elevated BLLs and a limited sample size, the NHANES 
      1999--2000 estimates are highly variable. 
      <H4><B>State and Local Surveillance </B></H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>By 2001, 44 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and New York City 
      (NYC) were submitting child blood lead surveillance data to CDC. These 
      sites represent 95% of the U.S. population of children aged &lt;72 months 
      and 97% of pre-1950 housing. By the end of 2001, all states with 
      CDC-associated CLPPPs were requiring laboratories to report results of 
      blood lead tests; however, states varied regarding the BLL level at which 
      results had to be reported (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab2">Table 
      2</A>). In 2001, 29 (64.4%) of the participating jurisdictions required 
      all BLLs to be reported; 12 (26.7%) required reporting only for BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL; one (2.2%) required reporting only for BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>15 µg/dL; one (2.2%) required reporting only for BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>20 µg/dL; and two (4.4%) required reporting only for BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>25 µg/dL. 
      <H4><B>Children Tested</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>The number of BLL-tested children reported to CDC increased from 
      1,703,356 in 1997 (37 states, DC, and NYC) to 2,422,298 in 2001 (44 
      states, DC, and NYC). For all years, the largest group of children tested 
      were aged 12--23 months, followed by those aged 24--35 months (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab3">Table 
      3</A>). Race or ethnicity information was not collected (i.e., was 
      unknown) for approximately half of the children tested. For all years, 
      among the tested children for whom race or ethnicity was reported (range: 
      57% in 1997 to 40.2% in 2001), approximately 43% were non-Hispanic whites, 
      35% were non-Hispanic blacks, 15% were Hispanic, and 7% were of other 
      races or ethnicities (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab4">Table 
      4</A>). For all years, slightly more boys than girls were tested (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab5">Table 
      5</A>). More than half of all tests were conducted by six states and NYC 
      (NYC 11.3%, Massachusetts 10.1%, Illinois 7.7%, Texas 7.1%, New York 6.6%, 
      New Jersey 6%, and North Carolina 5%) (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab6">Table 
      6</A>). </P>
      <P>During 1997--2001, 28 states reported matching surveillance and 
      Medicaid data to assess the percentage of children eligible for or 
      receiving Medicaid services who had received a blood lead test (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig2">Figure 
      2</A>). However, these states used different methods to assess lead 
      testing among Medicaid-eligible or Medicaid-enrolled children, making 
      findings difficult to compare. For example, certain states that link 
      surveillance and Medicaid data might also link these with birth records. 
      Also, states used different definitions for Medicaid-eligible and 
      Medicaid-enrolled and different age cutoffs for analysis. Eight states 
      that matched Medicaid data with surveillance data reported that 
      17.2%--52.9% of Medicaid enrollees aged <U>&lt;</U>72 months had been 
      tested for lead. 
      <H4><B>Confirmed Elevated BLLs</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>The number of children reported with confirmed elevated BLLs steadily 
      decreased from 130,512 in 1997 to 74,887 in 2001. Among children with 
      elevated BLLs and known race or ethnicity (range: 74.3% in 1997 to 63.6% 
      in 2001), approximately 17% were non-Hispanic whites, 60% were 
      non-Hispanic blacks, 16% were Hispanic, and 7% were of other races or 
      ethnicities (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab4">Table 
      4</A>). In each racial or ethnic group, the number of children with 
      elevated BLLs declined steadily from 1997 to 2001. Each year, more boys 
      than girls had elevated BLLs (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab5">Table 
      5</A>). Five states and NYC reported 54% of the confirmed elevated BLLs in 
      2001 (Illinois, 20.5%; Ohio, 8.7%; Michigan, 6.8%; NYC, 6.6%; New York, 
      6.4%; and Pennsylvania, 5.7%) (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab6">Table 
      6</A>). </P>
      <P>In 2001, 59.7% of children with elevated BLLs had levels of 10--14 
      µg/dL; 21.3% had levels of 15--19 µg/dL; 9.2% had levels of 20--24 µg/dL; 
      8.6% had levels of 25--44 µg/dL; 1% had levels of 45--69 µg/dL; and 0.2% 
      had levels <U>&gt;</U>70 µg/dL (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig3">Figure 
      3</A>). In 2000, a total of 8,723 children (0.4% of those tested) were 
      reported with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>25 µg/dL, the target for elimination by 
      2000. In 2001, the number of children reported with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>25 
      µg/dL decreased to 7,342 (0.3% of those tested). Among those with 
      confirmed elevated BLLs and reported race or ethnicity, the majority were 
      non-Hispanic blacks (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig4">Figure 
      4</A>). Also, the largest numbers of children with confirmed elevated BLLs 
      were located in northeastern and Midwestern states (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig5">Figure 
      5</A>). 
      <H4><B>Pre-1950 Housing</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>The number of existing U.S. housing units built before 1950, when paint 
      had high lead content, decreased from 27.5 million in 1990 to 25.8 million 
      in 2000; however, pre-1950 housing units are located in all states (range: 
      12,472 in Alaska to 3,309,770 in New York). In 2000, approximately 80% of 
      the 25.8 million pre-1950 housing units in the United States were located 
      in 21 states, and approximately 50% were located in seven states 
      (California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Ohio, and 
      Pennsylvania) (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#fig6">Figure 
      6</A>). 
      <H3 align=center><B><FONT color=#0b3d91>Discussion</FONT></B> </H3>
      <P></P>
      <P>National surveys and state and local surveillance data both indicate 
      children's BLLs continue to decline throughout the United States. This 
      decline reflects changes in national policies and laws implemented since 
      the 1970s that have limited the use of lead, including removal of lead 
      from 1) gasoline, 2) food and soft-drink cans, 3) paint for residential 
      use, and 4) solder in household plumbing (<I>36</I>). The greatest 
      reduction in children's BLLs was observed between NHANES II (1976--1980) 
      and NHANES III, Phase I (1988--1991), suggesting that past policies to 
      reduce children's exposure to lead have succeeded. However, the <I>Healthy 
      People 2000</I> national goal to eliminate BLLs &gt;25 µg/dL among young 
      children by 2000 was not achieved, and tens of thousands of children 
      remain exposed to lead. </P>
      <P>State and local surveillance data and previous NHANES analyses indicate 
      children who are non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanic are more likely to have 
      elevated BLLs than those who are non-Hispanic whites (<I><a href="00048339.htm">37</a></I>). Although 
      race or ethnicity classification is missing for approximately half of 
      those children with elevated BLLs identified and reported in the state and 
      local surveillance data, these data suggest the number of children with 
      elevated BLLs has steadily declined in each of these groups, which 
      represent the three largest racial or ethnic populations. </P>
      <P>Another group previously determined to be at risk for elevated BLLs is 
      children from low-income families (<I>4,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00032080.htm">38</a></I>). In a previous finding, 
      Medicaid-eligible children represented 60% of children with BLLs 
      <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL and 83% of those with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>20 µg/dL 
      (<I>39</I>). However, despite their high risk for elevated BLLs, only 19% 
      of Medicaid-eligible children aged 1--5 years had been tested for lead 
      (<I><a href="rr4914a1.htm">40</a></I>). CDC recommends that health-care providers and health plans 
      provide blood lead screening and diagnostic and treatment services for 
      children enrolled in Medicaid (<I><a href="rr4914a1.htm">40</a></I>), which routinely reimburses for 
      such services. State and local surveillance systems do not routinely 
      include Medicaid information because health-care providers rarely note 
      Medicaid status on test records. To better determine how many 
      Medicaid-eligible or Medicaid-enrolled children have been tested for lead, 
      states need to link their laboratory surveillance data with Medicaid data. 
      The majority of CLPPPs have already made this link; however, different 
      methodologies limit comparisons among states. CDC will work with these 
      programs to standardize linking and analysis and improve comparability 
      among states. 
      <H4><B>Limitations</B> </H4>
      <P></P>
      <P>Findings from NHANES and state surveillance systems should be viewed as 
      complementary but not directly comparable; substantial differences in 
      methodology exist. Because NHANES is based on a nationally representative 
      sample, estimates are only generalizable to the U.S. population. The 
      sample is not designed to provide estimates for smaller geographic areas 
      or specific populations where the risk of elevated BLLs is high. 
      Conversely, the CLPPPs provide data at state and local levels that can be 
      used to target screening and other interventions to children at highest 
      risk. However, not all children at risk are tested. NHANES and CLPPPs also 
      differ in methods used to collect blood samples. For NHANES, all blood 
      lead tests are collected by venous sampling, a more accurate method. In 
      contrast, certain blood lead tests reported to state health departments 
      are collected by capillary sampling, which can be contaminated if correct 
      blood collection procedures are not followed. Because of the risk for 
      contamination (<I>41</I>), elevated capillary tests should be confirmed by 
      a venous test or a second capillary test within 12 weeks. However, because 
      confirmatory testing does not always occur within 12 weeks, state data 
      might underestimate children with elevated BLLs, especially at levels of 
      10--14 µg/dL, among states that do not recommend confirmatory testing at 
      that BLL (<I>42</I>). Also, for NHANES surveys, all samples are analyzed 
      by the CDC laboratory, which reports all test results. In contrast, 
      multiple laboratories analyze and report blood lead test results to 
      CLPPPs. </P>
      <P>State-to-state comparisons of the numbers of children tested and 
      confirmed with elevated BLLs should be made cautiously, with special 
      attention given to varying state practices (<A 
      href="ss5210a1.htm#tab2">Table 
      2</A>). State practices and policies that can affect assessment of the 
      lead problem include BLLs reported and the time recommended for follow-up 
      testing to confirm elevated BLLs. Certain states are changing policies to 
      improve their ability to develop and assess prevention strategies; since 
      2001, two more states have made all BLLs reportable for children. Because 
      the majority of children with elevated BLLs are asymptomatic, all children 
      at high risk should be tested; however, state testing practices vary. 
      Children in certain racial or ethnic groups (i.e., non-Hispanic blacks and 
      Hispanics) are at increased risk for elevated BLLs (<I>18,33,<a href="00048339.htm">37</a></I>). CDC 
      encourages collecting racial and ethnic data; however, a high proportion 
      of missing racial data precludes the majority of states from knowing 
      whether they are adequately testing children at increased risk. 
      <H3 align=center><B><FONT color=#0b3d91>Conclusion</FONT></B> </H3>
      <P></P>
      <P>Successful surveillance requires states to track the test results of 
      substantial numbers of children. This has strained old computer systems 
      and created barriers to successful submission of complete data to CDC. 
      Also, BLL tracking systems need to integrate data across programs. To 
      improve integration of data, increase states' abilities to submit complete 
      data, and facilitate exchange of information for case management (e.g., 
      environmental inspection), CDC is developing a tracking module that will 
      become part of CDC's Internet-based tracking and reporting system, the 
      National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) (<I>43</I>). </P>
      <P>Reports published by states can differ from this report in the numbers 
      of children tested and identified with elevated BLLs. CDC's criteria for 
      consistent dates and other data can preclude certain records from being 
      entered into the CDC database. Also, certain states might publish data for 
      older children (i.e., aged <U>&gt;</U>72 months) or use different 
      definitions in their analyses. Better comparability among states requires 
      increased use of a uniform national surveillance case definition 
      (<I>44</I>) by public health officials and researchers. Comparability is 
      critical to accurately assess the number of children with elevated BLLs 
      and to monitor trends, including progress toward the <I>Healthy People 
      2010</I> goal of eliminating BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 µg/dL among young 
      children. </P>
      <P>Reducing BLLs can be a difficult and protracted process for children 
      with long-term exposure because lead accumulates in bones and is released 
      slowly over time. Chelation, the only available medical therapy, has side 
      effects and risks, might not reverse harmful effects, and does not 
      effectively reduce BLLs in children with moderate exposure (<I>45</I>). 
      CDC and others recommend screening the environment for lead to prevent 
      exposure to children (<I>46--50</I>). Identifying sources of lead exposure 
      can be challenging, especially for children who move or spend time in 
      multiple locations. Effective identification of pre-1950 housing where 
      young children live or are likely to live requires assessment of data from 
      multiple sources (e.g., tax assessor, census, Medicaid, and child blood 
      lead surveillance) and improved partnerships with other programs (e.g., 
      prenatal care; home visits for newborns; the Women, Infants, and Children 
      nutritional program; immunizations; and housing subsidies). </P>
      <P>Elevated BLLs among young children can be eliminated by state and local 
      prevention activities. Beginning in 2003, state and local health 
      departments funded by CDC for childhood lead poisoning prevention programs 
      are required to develop formal elimination plans. Certain jurisdictions 
      (i.e., Minnesota, Boston, Chicago, and Cleveland) already have convened 
      lead elimination workgroups involving key representatives from health, 
      housing, banking, and other areas involved in children's health and 
      welfare. A critical factor in any elimination plan is use of local data to 
      define and address local problems. Key elements for effective targeting 
      strategies include 1) enacting state laws requiring reporting of all BLLs, 
      2) linking state-level environmental and Medicaid enrollment data, 3) 
      improving overall data quality, and 4) streamlining reporting through 
      NEDSS. </P>
      <P>CDC will continue to urge CLPPPs to direct interventions at areas with 
      the greatest demonstrated problems, and at populations with the highest 
      risks. State and local data, in combination with NHANES, will enable us to 
      continue monitoring progress toward elimination of elevated BLLs among all 
      young children.
