<H1>Unintentional Topical Lindane Ingestions --- United States, 1998--2003</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Lindane* is an organochlorine pesticide found in certain prescription-only shampoos and topical lotions used to treat 
pediculosis (i.e., lice infestation) and scabies; lindane has been associated with human neurologic toxicity 
(<I>1,2</I>). In 2004, CDC was alerted to cases of illness caused by unintentional ingestion of lindane by persons mistaking the product for a liquid oral medication (e.g., cough syrup). To assess the extent of illness from ingestion of lindane, CDC, with assistance from the U.S. Environmental 

Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and state health departments, collected case reports and analyzed data from the Sentinel Event Notification System for Occupational Risks-Pesticides (SENSOR-Pesticides) program and the Toxic 
Exposure Surveillance System (TESS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which identified 870 cases of unintentional 

lindane ingestion during 1998--2003, and describes two examples of lindane ingestions. To reduce the risk of 
lindane ingestion, public health authorities should alert clinicians to the hazards of lindane and the importance of following FDA usage guidelines, which include dispensing lindane in manufacturer-produced, 1- or 2-ounce single-use containers. 
<H4>
<B>Case Reports </B>
</H4>
</P><P><b>Case 1.</b> In November 2004, the Washington State Department of Health reported that a boy aged 3 years 
ingested approximately 1 teaspoon of 1% lindane shampoo from a previously used 2-ounce bottle. Subsequently, the mother 
induced vomiting in the boy twice; 1 hour later the boy collapsed and experienced a tonic-clonic seizure lasting 4--5 minutes. After 
3 hours, the child was discharged from the emergency department in stable condition. 
</P><P><b>Case 2.</b> In December 2003, a man aged 47 years in Texas mistakenly ingested 1 ounce of lindane (percentage 
concentration unknown) from a bottle he believed to be cough syrup. The man vomited; he contacted the poison control center 
the following morning. He did not seek clinical evaluation.
<H4>
<B>Surveillance Data</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Data were analyzed from pesticide poisoning surveillance systems participating in the SENSOR-Pesticides 
program<SUP>&#134;</SUP> to identify symptomatic cases involving unintentional topical lindane ingestions during 1998--2003. Cases were classified as definite, probable, possible, or suspicious based on the clinical interpretation of signs or symptoms reported by a physician 

or patient, and evidence of lindane ingestion (<I>3,4</I>). Cases were also obtained from TESS<SUP>&#167;</SUP>, which is maintained by the American Association of Poison Control Centers; poison 
information specialists determined which cases had signs and 
symptoms consistent with lindane exposure. Illness severity was categorized for all cases. Excluded were cases involving ingestion of veterinary and agricultural pesticide products that contained lindane. 
</P><P>During 1998--2003, TESS reported 857 symptomatic cases of unintentional lindane ingestion (<a href = "mm5421a2.htm#fig">Figure</a>); none of the 
cases were reported as resulting in death. Severity was low in 778 cases (91%), moderate in 71 cases (8%), and high in eight 
cases (1%) (<I>4</I>). Among 823 patients with known ages, 

median age was 13 years (range: &lt;1--86 years); 53% were 
female. Signs and symptoms included vomiting (59%), nausea (18%), oral irritation (19%), abdominal cramping (4%), cough (4%), 
and seizure (3%).
</P><P>During 1998--2003, SENSOR-Pesticides identified a total of 13 symptomatic cases of unintentional lindane ingestion. 
Four cases (31%) were classified as definite, two (15%) as probable, six (46%) as possible, and one (8%) as suspicious. Severity 
was low in eight cases (62%), moderate in three cases (23%), and high in two cases (15%) 
(<I>3</I>). Median age was 7 years (range: &lt;1--58 years), and 69% were male. Signs and symptoms included vomiting (69%), nausea (46%), headache (23%), seizure (23%), abdominal cramping (8%), and confusion (8%). Six (46%) cases in children and four (31%) cases in adults were the result 

of mistaking lindane for cough syrup; two (15%) cases were in unsupervised children who drank lindane, and one (8%) case was the result of pharmacy error (i.e., lindane was recovered from a bottle labeled albuterol).
</P><P>In addition to lindane, FDA-approved treatments for 

pediculosis include two over-the-counter medications 
(pyrethrin/piperonyl butoxide and permethrin) and malathion, a prescription-only therapy. During 1998--2003, TESS identified 523 symptomatic cases of unintentional ingestion of these alternative medications (<a href = "mm5421a2.htm#fig">Figure</a>). Median age was 9 years (range: &lt;1--67 years). Among TESS reports, unintentional lindane ingestions were more likely to produce illness (857 illnesses of 1,463 

ingestions [58%]) than unintentional ingestions of each of three other medications, and more likely to produce illness than all three of those medications combined (523 illnesses of 1,691 ingestions [31%]; odds ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 2.72--3.67).

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> Pediculosis and scabies are common human parasitic infestations. This report indicates that when lindane, 
a treatment for pediculosis and scabies, is unintentionally 

ingested, illness can occur, including vomiting and seizures. In 
1995, lindane was changed to a second-line therapy for pediculosis because safer alternatives existed (<I>5</I>). Lindane also had the slowest pediculicidal and least effective ovicidal 

activity<SUP> </SUP>compared with three other approved pediculicides (i.e., 1% permethrin, 
0.3% pyrethrin, and 0.5% malathion) (<I>6</I>). In 2003, in light of continued postmarketing surveillance 
reports of toxicity, FDA revised product labeling guidelines to limit the amount of lindane dispensed to 1- or 2-ounce single-use containers and to require providing patients with a Medication Guide warning of risks from inappropriate use. In addition, FDA issued a Public 
Health Advisory with these changes (<I>7</I>). The new advisory, along with a substantial 

increase in retail price for lindane, appear to 
have resulted in a declining number of cases of lindane ingestion (<a href = "mm5421a2.htm#fig">Figure</a>). This decline is similar to the 67% decrease in lindane prescriptions from 1998 to 2003 (<I>8</I>).
</P><P>Before the advisory, bottles of bulk lindane were sometimes repackaged by pharmacies into smaller bottles resembling 
those used for liquid oral medications (e.g., cough syrup). This 
resemblance likely contributed to many unintentional 
ingestions. Subsequent to the advisory, bottles of bulk lindane still in use were not recalled from pharmacies. Therefore, some repackaging might still occur. In addition, consumers might have repackaged lindane in their homes. 
</P><P>In September 2004, the North American Task Force on Lindane drafted an action plan for future use. On January 1, 
2005, Canada withdrew registration of lindane for agricultural pest control; Mexico is working on a plan to phase out all uses of lindane. However, with the exception of California, which banned lindane for medicinal use on January 1, 2002, 

U.S. representatives to the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation announced that the United States 
will continue to allow use of lindane as both a pesticide and pharmaceutical 
(<I>9</I>).
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, because of the passive surveillance methodology of TESS and SENSOR, the number of reported cases is likely fewer than the number of actual cases. Second, certain 
eligible cases might have been inadvertently excluded because of erroneous information that suggested exposure to lindane in 

a veterinary or agricultural product. Finally, although all cases were symptomatic, the possibility of false positives cannot be excluded. Because clinical findings of lindane poisoning are nonspecific and no standard diagnostic test exists, certain illnesses related temporally to lindane exposure might not have been caused by the exposure. 
</P><P>Lindane use in shampoos and lotions for treatment of 

pediculosis and scabies is declining. However, because of the 
toxicity of lindane and the potential for illness from unintentional ingestion, health-care providers should be 
educated regarding appropriate use and packaging. Lindane is a second-line therapy for both scabies and lice and should not be tried unless other treatments have failed or are intolerable; use of lindane also should be avoided for persons weighing less than 110 pounds (50 kg). Because of the risk for toxicity, treatment should not be repeated, even if itching persists; itching can occur, even after successful treatment (especially for scabies) and can be treated symptomatically. In addition, pharmacists should not transfer lindane to other containers and should only dispense lindane in manufacturer-provided 1- or 2-ounce 
containers. Finally, periodic educational outreach programs can help increase awareness among health-care providers of the new lindane use guidelines.
