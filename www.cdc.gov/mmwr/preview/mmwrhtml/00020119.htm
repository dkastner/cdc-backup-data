<h1>Green Tobacco Sickness in Tobacco Harvesters -- Kentucky, 1992 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Green tobacco sickness (GTS) is an illness resulting from
 dermal
exposure to dissolved nicotine from wet tobacco leaves; it is
characterized by nausea, vomiting, weakness, and dizziness and
sometimes fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate (1-3). On
September 14, 1992, the Occupational Health Nurses in Agricultural
Communities (OHNAC) project of Kentucky * received reports of 27
 cases
of GTS. The cases occurred among tobacco harvesters who had sought
treatment in several hospital emergency departments in
 south-central
Kentucky during the preceding 2 weeks. This report summarizes the
findings of the investigation of these cases. </p>
<p>On September 15, OHNAC staff initiated a review of inpatient
 and
emergency department medical records from May 1 through October 2
 at
five hospitals in the Bowling Green and Elizabethtown areas. The
review identified 55 persons in whom GTS, nicotine poisoning, or
other illnesses compatible with GTS symptomatology had been
diagnosed. On September 25, industrial hygienists from CDC's
 National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) observed the
tobacco-harvesting process. Worker's hands, forearms, thighs, and
backs received the most dermal exposure to wet tobacco. Dew from
tobacco leaves often saturated workers' clothing within minutes of
beginning field work. </p>
<p>To evaluate possible risk factors associated with GTS, NIOSH
investigators and occupational health nurses from the OHNAC project

conducted a case-control study. A case was defined as an emergency
department diagnosis of GTS or nicotine poisoning in a person whose

recorded work history included tobacco harvesting at the time of
illness. Forty-nine persons met the case definition, with episodes
occurring from July 25 through September 19, 1992; two cases were
subsequently excluded from analysis because illness onset coincided

with exposure to pesticides (which can induce similar symptoms).
Median age of the 47 case-patients was 29 years (range: 14-54
 years);
41 (87%) were male. Controls were 83 asymptomatic tobacco
 harvesters
referred by case-patients or local agricultural extension agents.
Their median age was 39 years (range: 16-70 years); 72 (87%) were
male. </p>
<p>Twelve (26%) case-patients were hospitalized for 1-2 days; of
these, two (4%) required intensive-care treatment for hypotension
 and
bradycardia. All case-patients were initially treated in emergency
departments with antiemetic drugs, and 35 (74%) received
 intravenous
fluids. </p>
<p>Forty of 47 case-patients and 83 controls were administered a
questionnaire by telephone. Respondents were asked about the types
of jobs performed during the tobacco growing season, use of
protective clothing, exposure to wet tobacco leaves, work in wet
clothing, work duration, and personal tobacco use. </p>
<p>Among the 40 case-patients who completed interviews, the
 median
time from starting work to onset of illness was 10 hours (range:
 3-17
hours); most frequently reported symptoms included weakness (100%),

nausea (98%), vomiting (91%), dizziness (91%), abdominal cramps
(70%), headache (60%), and difficulty breathing (60%). The mean
duration of illness was 2.4 days. Thirty-six (90%) had previous
 work
experience with tobacco. Of these, 14 (39%) had previously sought
medical care for symptoms suggestive of GTS. Seventeen (85%) of 20
case-patients aged greater than or equal to 30 years attributed
 their
illness to working in wet tobacco, compared with 12 (60%)
case-patients aged less than 30 years. </p>
<p>Age less than 30 years was a risk factor for illness (odds
 ratio
{OR}=3.1; 95% confidence interval {CI}=1.4-7.0). All case-patients
and 69 (83%) controls had worked in fields of wet tobacco where
 their
clothes became wet (OR=infinite; lower confidence limit=1.8).
 Current
use of personal tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes, snuff, chewing
tobacco, pipe, or cigars) appeared to be weakly protective, but the

estimate was not statistically significant (OR=0.7; 95%
 CI=0.3-1.5).
Sex and work duration (i.e., number of hours per day or number of
days per week) were not associated with illness. The reported use
 of
protective clothing was similar for case-patients and controls; for

case-patients and controls combined, reported use of protective
 items
worn at least once during the growing season was 5% for waterproof
clothing and 32% for gloves. </p>
<p>Representative hospital costs were calculated for three levels

of care received by 31 case-patients treated at two participating
hospitals. Fees averaged $250 for outpatient treatment, $566 for
hospital admission, and $2041 for intensive-care treatment. </p>

<p>Editorial Note: Before 1992, no cases of GTS had been reported to
Kentucky public health agencies. Increased surveillance of adverse
health events in persons working in agriculture and increased
awareness of the condition may explain the reports in Kentucky
 during
this harvest season (i.e., late summer). Before the NIOSH
investigation was initiated, OHNAC occupational health nurses had
supplied emergency department physicians with literature about GTS.

In addition, rainfall during the 1992 season was
 uncharacteristically
heavy, potentially increasing exposure to wet tobacco and incidence

of GTS. </p>
<p>The lower risk for GTS among older workers may result from
 work
practices developed over time that reduce contact with wet tobacco.

In addition, workers likely to develop symptoms of GTS may leave
 this
work force at a young age. One potential limitation to these
 findings
is that the age distribution of controls may not reflect the local
population of tobacco workers. </p>
<p>Personal use of tobacco products may be weakly protective,
probably because of development of tolerance to the effects of
nicotine among regular tobacco users. Tolerance may not be
 protective
if dermal absorption substantially exceeds the user's customary
nicotine intake (4), which may have occurred in this outbreak
 because
of heavier than usual rains. </p>
<p>Approximately 60,000 persons harvest tobacco annually in
Kentucky at least part-time (5). The estimated crude 2-month
incidence rate of hospital-treated GTS among tobacco workers in the

five-county study area was 10 per 1000 workers.** Statewide
extrapolation of this incidence rate suggests as many as 600
 persons
in Kentucky could have sought emergency department care for the
condition. However, this figure may underestimate the true
 incidence
of GTS because many affected persons may not seek hospital
 treatment
(2). </p>
<p>Use of protective clothing (e.g., water-resistant clothing and

rubber gloves) reduces the amount of nicotine absorbed by workers
 in
contact with green tobacco (6,7). Tobacco farm owners should inform

their employees of the hazards associated with harvesting wet
 tobacco
and the importance of safe work practices in preventing GTS;
 discuss
routes of exposure and symptoms associated with the disease; advise

workers to change into clean, dry clothing and boots during the
 work
day if these become wet; and allow flexible work hours to avoid
 work
during or immediately after a rainfall. Health-care providers in
areas where tobacco is harvested should consider GTS in workers who

present with symptoms similar to those reported here. </p>
<p>To determine whether GTS regularly occurs or whether this
outbreak was due to an unusually wet growing season, the OHNAC
project of Kentucky will continue active surveillance for GTS in
local hospitals and clinics during tobacco growing seasons. The
Kentucky Department for Health Services will disseminate
 information
on GTS to health-care professionals and institutions statewide.
Workers will be informed about the condition and preventive
 measures
through the Cooperative Extension Service and through press
 releases
to community newspapers. </p>

    OHNAC is a national surveillance program conducted by CDC's
 National

 placed
    public health nurses in rural communities and hospitals in 10
 states
    (California, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, New York,
    North Carolina, North Dakota, and Ohio) to conduct surveillance of
    agriculture-related illnesses and injuries that occur among farmers

    and their family members. These surveillance data are used to
 reduce
    the risk for occupational illness and injury in agricultural
    populations.
    ** The denominator for this rate is based on an estimate of 78.8
    person-hours worked per acre during tobacco harvest, the number of
    acres planted with tobacco, and an estimate of 256 harvest-hours
    worked annually per worker (the median value reported in the
 Kentucky
    GTS case-control study). These figures generated an estimate of
 4730
    tobacco-harvest workers in the five affected counties, of whom 47
    sought medical treatment at local hospitals. </p>
