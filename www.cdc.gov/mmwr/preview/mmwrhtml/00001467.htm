Summary </p>
<p>Since 1983, the number of legal abortions reported to CDC
 increased by
5% to 1,333,521 in 1984; in 1985, that number decreased by less
 than 1%
to 1,328,570. The national abortion rate was the same for both
years--24 per 1,000 females ages 15-44 years. The abortion ratio
 for
1984 was 364 legally induced abortions per 1,000 live births; the
 ratio
for 1985 was 354 per 1,000. Abortion ratios were higher among women
 of
black and other minority races and among women younger than 15
 years of
age. Women undergoing legally induced abortions tended 1) to be
 young,
white, and unmarried, 2) to have had no previous live births, and
 3) to
be having the procedure for the first time. Curettage was the
 procedure
used in 96% of the reported cases. Eleven deaths were associated
 with
legally induced abortions in 1984, and six in 1985. The
 case-fatality
rate in 1985 was 0.5 deaths per 100,000 legally induced abortions,
 down
from the 0.8 per 100,000 reported in 1983 and 1984. Overall, since
1980, the numbers and rates of abortion have had only slight
year-to-year fluctuations. The steady increase in the percentage of

repeat abortions since 1972 reflects the ongoing availability of
 legal
abortions. Since the beginning of CDC's abortion mortality
surveillance, the number of deaths related to legal abortions has
decreased 75%, from 24 deaths in 1972 to six deaths in 1985.
INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>In 1969, CDC began abortion surveillance to document the number
 and
characteristics of women obtaining abortions and to assist in
 efforts
to eliminate preventable morbidity and mortality associated with
abortions. This report presents abortion data reported to CDC for
 1984
and 1985.
MATERIALS AND METHODS </p>
<p>For 1984 and 1985, CDC received statistics from 52 reporting
 areas: 50
states, New York City, and the District of Columbia. Central health

agencies reported data for 44 areas, and hospitals and other
 medical
facilities reported data for the other eight. Total numbers of
abortions were available from all reporting areas, most of which
 also
provided information on the characteristics of women obtaining
abortions (Tables 1 and 2). After unknown values were excluded,
percentage distributions were calculated for these characteristics.

Data are reported by state of occurrence unless otherwise noted.
&#12; Abortion-related deaths reported to CDC are investigated by
 medical
epidemiologists to determine the type of abortion, the cause of
 death,
and possible contributing factors that may have been preventable.
Deaths are first classified as abortion related or not abortion
related. Abortion-related deaths are further classified into
 induced
(legally or illegally) or spontaneous abortions. Classification of
 all
deaths is based on information obtained from death certificates,
medical records, and autopsy reports. Since CDC began abortion
mortality surveillance in 1972, approximately two-thirds of
abortion-related deaths have been reported by state health
 agencies.
The remainder have been identified through other sources--CDC's
National Center for Health Statistics, state and local maternal
mortality committees, the Commission on Professional and Hospital
Activities, case histories published in professional journals, and
other private sources.
RESULTS </p>
<p>In 1984, 1,333,521 legal abortions were reported--5% more than the

number reported for the previous year (1). In 1985, the number
decreased to 1,328,570, a reduction of less than 1% from the 1984
figure. The national abortion rate increased from 23 abortions per
1,000 women ages 15-44 in 1983 to 24 per 1,000 in both 1984 and
 1985.
The abortion ratio increased from 349 abortions per 1,000 live
 births
in 1983 to 364 per 1,000 in 1984, and then fell to 354 per 1,000 in

1985 (Table 1, Figures 1-3). </p>
<p>In 1984 and 1985, as in previous years, California reported the
highest number of abortions, followed by New York City and Texas
 (2).
Wyoming had the lowest number of abortions in those years--498 in
 1984
and 436 in 1985. The abortion rates in those years ranged from four

abortions per 1,000 women ages 15-44 in Kentucky and Wyoming to
 more
than 100 per 1,000 in the District of Columbia. The abortion ratios

were highest in the District of Columbia and New York City (the
 only
reporting areas that are not states) and lowest in Kentucky and
Wyoming. </p>
<p>Approximately 92% of women obtaining abortions had the procedure
 done
within their state of residence. The percentage of abortions
 obtained
by out-of-state residents ranged from approximately 50% in the
 District
of Columbia during 1984 and 1985 to approximately 1% in Hawaii,
Illinois, and Wyoming in 1984 and Hawaii and Wyoming in 1985
 (Tables 3
and 4). Data on the percentage of abortions obtained by
 out-of-state
residents are not available for eight reporting areas. </p>
<p>In 1984, 36 states, the District of Columbia, and New York City
reported legal abortions by age; in 1985, 37 states, the District
 of
Columbia, and New York City reported those figures. In both years,
women 15-29 years of age had approximately 80% of all abortions,
whereas women younger than 15 years of age had approximately 1%
 (Tables
5 and 6). The abortion ratio was highest for women under 15 years
 of
age and second highest for women 15-19 years of age. The abortion
 ratio
for women under 15 years of age was 1,439 abortions per 1,000 live
births in 1984 and 1,376 per 1,000 in 1985; the ratio for women
 15-19
years of age was 697 per 1,000 live births in 1984 and 688 per
 1,000 in
1985 (Figure 4). Although teenagers' abortion ratios were the
&#12;highest during 1984-1985, the proportion of legal abortions they
obtained continued to decrease. In 1984 and 1985, teenagers had 26%
 of
all legal abortions. Among that age group, the abortion ratio was
lowest among 19-year-olds and highest among those younger than 15
 years
old (Tables 7 and 8). </p>
<p>In 1984 and 1985, approximately 48% of reported legal abortions
 were
performed before 8 weeks of gestation, and 87% were done at or
 before
12 weeks of gestation (Tables 9 and 10). Less than 4% of the
 abortions
for those 2 years were performed at 16-20 weeks of gestation, and
 less
than 1% at 21 or more weeks of gestation. </p>
<p>In both years, approximately 96% of legal abortions were performed
 by
curettage (Tables 11 and 12). In less than 2%, the method used was
intrauterine saline or prostaglandin instillation. </p>
<p>In 1984 and 1985, approximately two-thirds of women obtaining
 legal
abortions were white (Table 13); this finding continued a
 previously
noted trend (2). The abortion ratio, however, was higher for black
women and women of other minority races than for white women: 475
versus 288 abortions per 1,000 live births in 1984 and 472 versus
 277
abortions per 1,000 in 1985. </p>
<p>The percentage of women undergoing legal abortions who were
 unmarried
rose from 73% in 1983 to 78% in 1984, and then to almost 80% in
 1985.
The abortion ratio was 14 times higher for unmarried women than for

married women: 1,267 versus 93 abortions per 1,000 live births in
 1984
and 1,174 versus 80 per 1,000 in 1985 (Table 14). </p>
<p>In both years, more than 55% of the women obtaining legal
 abortions
had had no previous live births, and about 91% had had two or fewer

live births (Table 15). In both 1984 and 1985, the abortion ratio
 was
highest for women who had had no live births and lowest for women
 who
had had one live birth. </p>
<p>Approximately 58% of women obtaining abortions in 1984 and 1985
 had
the procedure for the first time, but more than 13% had had at
 least
two previous abortions (Table 16). </p>
<p>When the proportions of women undergoing abortions were analyzed
 by
age group and marital status, few differences were reported between

white women and women of black and other minority races (Tables 17
 and
18). However, the proportion of black and other minority women less

than 15 having abortions was more than twice that of white women in

this age group. </p>
<p>When analyzed by gestational age, more than 99% of abortions at 12

weeks of gestation or less were performed by curettage (Tables 19
 and
20). After 12 weeks of gestation, the most common procedure was
dilatation and evacuation (D&amp;E). Most intrauterine instillations
involved the use of saline and were performed at 16 weeks of
 gestation
or later. </p>
<p>In 1984, according to information reported to CDC, 18 women died
 as a
result of abortion (Table 21). Of the 18 deaths, 11 were associated

with a legally induced abortion, and six with a spontaneous
 abortion.
In 1985, 14 women died as a result of abortion. Of these, six were
associated with a legally induced abortion, six with a spontaneous
abortion, one with an illegally induced abortion, and one
&#12;could not be classified. The updated total for 1983 showed 18
 deaths as
a result of abortion. Included in this total were two additional
reported deaths associated with legal abortion, raising the
 preliminary
case-fatality rate for legal abortion from 0.7 deaths per 100,000
abortions to 0.8 deaths per 100,000 for that year. In 1984, the
case-fatality rate remained at 0.8 deaths per 100,000 legally
 induced
abortions, but then fell to 0.5 per 100,000 in 1985.
DISCUSSION </p>
<p>From 1969 to 1982, the reported number of legal abortions in the
United States increased every year (Figure 1); the largest
 percentage
increase occurred in the period 1969-1973. From 1976 to 1982, this
annual increase declined continuously, reaching a low of 0.2% for
1981-1982. Although in 1983 the reported number of legal abortions
declined for the first time since abortion surveillance began,
 since
1980 the numbers, as well as the rates and ratios of abortion, have
 had
only small year-to-year fluctuations (1). </p>
<p>From 1969 to 1980, the abortion ratio increased each year, but
 from
1980 to 1983 it declined each year (Figure 2). Although this ratio
increased in 1984 to 364 abortions per 1,000 live births, it fell
 to
354 per 1,000 in 1985. The abortion rate also increased each year
through 1980, when it reached 25 abortions per 1,000 females ages
15-44; it declined to 24 per 1,000 in 1981. Since that time, the
 rate
has remained stable at approximately 24 per 1,000 (Figure 3). </p>
<p>The numbers of legal abortions reported to CDC in 1984 and 1985
 were
probably lower than the numbers actually performed. These numbers
 are
based primarily on information provided by central health agencies,

whose totals have been consistently lower than those obtained by
 direct
surveys. For instance, in both 1984 and 1985, the total number of
abortions reported by CDC was approximately 16% lower than that
reported by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a private organization
 that
obtains information by direct survey of abortion providers (3).
 Because
of the consistency of CDC's data collection method, however, the
characteristics reported here are believed to reflect the overall
characteristics of women obtaining abortions in the United States. </p>
<p>In each year from 1975 to 1985, at least 89% of abortions were
performed in the woman's state of residence. In addition, the
 number of
women obtaining an abortion in their state of residence increased
 from
89% in 1975 to 93% in 1983, but then fell to approximately 92% for
 both
1984 and 1985. </p>
<p>In 1972, the women obtaining abortions were almost evenly
 distributed
among three age groups: 19 years of age or less, 20-24 years of
 age,
and 25 or more years of age. Between 1972 and 1985, the number of
teenagers obtaining abortions decreased steadily from 33% to 26%.
Upward shifts in the age of women in the population may account for
 the
continuing greater proportion, in 1984 and 1985, of abortions
 obtained
by women 20 years of age and older. In 1975, approximately 78% of
 women
ages 15-44 were over age 20. In 1980, that figure increased to 80%,
 and
by 1985 the proportion of women over 20 had increased to
 approximately
84% (4,5).
&#12; Of the women who obtained abortions between 1972 and 1985, the
proportion who were unmarried women increased steadily, from 70% to

81%. The percentages who were black or of other minority races
increased from 23% to 33%, and the percentage who had had one or no

previous live births increased from 67% to 77%. When abortions are
studied by gestational age, the percentage distribution has been
 stable
since 1977. </p>
<p>In 1984 and 1985, the trend continued for fewer women to obtain
abortions for the first time; these women had accounted for 87% of
 all
abortions in 1974 but accounted for only 57% in 1985. During this
11-year period, the percentage of women who previously had had one
induced abortion increased from 11.3% to 25.0%; those who had had
 two
induced abortions increased from 1.5% to 9.6%; and those who had
 had
three or more induced abortions increased from 0.4% to 4.7%. These
increases reflect both the ongoing availability of abortions and
 the
fact that women who have had an abortion are more likely to have
another (6-8). </p>
<p>Between 1972 and 1985, the percentage of abortions performed by
curettage increased from 88.6% to 97.5%. Surveillance during the
 same
period showed declines in the percentages of abortions performed by

intrauterine instillation (from 10.4% to 1.7%) and by hysterectomy
 and
hysterotomy (from 0.6% to 0.1%). </p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1985, the percentage of second-trimester
 abortions
performed by D&amp;E increased from 33% to 77%. During the same period,
 the
percentage of second-trimester abortions performed by intrauterine
instillation decreased from 57% to 16%. These changes most likely
reflect improved technology and physicians' awareness that a lower
 risk
of complications is associated with D&amp;Es than with instillation
procedures (9). </p>
<p>Since CDC's surveillance of abortion mortality began in 1972, 93%
fewer deaths have occurred. In 1972, 90 women died as a result of
abortion. Of those, 24 (27%) were related to a legally induced
 abortion
and 39 (43%) to an illegal abortion. In 1985, seven women died as a

result of induced abortion; of those, six resulted from a legal
abortion and one from an illegal abortion. In addition to the 75%

abortions. </p>
