<h1>Case Definitions for Infectious Conditions Under Public Health
Surveillance
</h1></a>

<p>Summary </p>
<p>State and local public health officials rely on health-care
providers, laboratories, and other public health personnel to
report the occurrence of notifiable diseases to state and local
health departments. Without such data, trends cannot be accurately
monitored, unusual occurrences of diseases might not be detected,
and the effectiveness of intervention activities cannot be easily
evaluated. </p>
<p>In the United States, requirements for reporting diseases are
mandated by state laws or regulations, and the list of reportable
diseases in each state differs. In October 1990, in collaboration
with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, CDC
published Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance (MMWR
1990;39{No. RR-13}), which, for the first time, provided uniform
criteria for reporting cases. </p>
<p>This report provides updated uniform criteria * for state
health department personnel to use when reporting the nationally
notifiable infectious diseases listed in Part 1 of this report. A
revision date is listed for each case definition that has been
revised. Newly generated case definitions that have not been
published previously are designated as &quot;adopted&quot; on the specified
date. Case definitions for some infectious conditions not
designated as nationally notifiable are included in Part 2 of this
report. Some of these conditions may have been nationally
notifiable or may become so; definitions are included here to
facilitate interpretation of data for these diseases. These
conditions may be reportable in some states. </p>
<p>INTRODUCTION </p>
<p>State and local public health officials rely on health-care
providers, laboratories, and other public health personnel to
report the occurrence of notifiable diseases to state and local
health departments. Without such data, trends cannot be accurately
monitored, unusual occurrences of diseases might not be detected,
and the effectiveness of intervention activities cannot be easily
evaluated. </p>
<p>In the United States, requirements for reporting diseases are
mandated by state laws or regulations, and the list of reportable
diseases in each state differs. CDC and the Council of State and
Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) have established a policy that
requires state health departments to report cases of selected
diseases (<a href="00047449.htm#00002413.htm">Table_1</a>) to CDC's National Notifiable Diseases
Surveillance System (NNDSS) (1,2). However, before 1990, the
usefulness of such data was limited by the lack of uniform case
definitions for public health surveillance. Without explicit
criteria for identifying cases for public health surveillance
purposes, state health departments and individual practitioners
often applied different criteria for reporting similar cases (3). </p>
<p>In October 1990, in collaboration with CSTE, CDC published
Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance (4), which, for
the first time, provided uniform criteria for reporting cases to
increase the specificity of reporting and improve the
comparability of diseases reported from different geographic
areas. This report supersedes the 1990 report, which included
infectious diseases and one noninfectious condition (i.e., spinal
cord injury). The CDC Surveillance Coordination Group has
established a steering committee that is charged with the
development of a broad range of case definitions for noninfectious
conditions (e.g., environmental or occupational conditions,
chronic diseases, adverse reproductive health events, and
injuries). This report provides updated uniform criteria for
public health professionals to use when reporting the nationally
notifiable infectious diseases listed in Part 1. A revision date
is included for each case definition that has been revised. Newly
generated case definitions that have not been previously published
are designated as &quot;adopted&quot; on the specified date. </p>
<p>Data for nationally notifiable diseases reported by the 50
states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S.
territories are collated and published weekly in the Morbidity and
Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health
departments to the NNDSS for weekly publication are provisional
because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting;
thus, these numbers may change. Updated final reports are
published annually in CDC's Summary of Notifiable Diseases, United
States (1). </p>
<p>The CDC/CSTE surveillance case definitions included in this
report differ in their use of clinical, laboratory, and
epidemiologic criteria to define cases. Some clinical syndromes do
not have confirmatory laboratory tests; however, laboratory
evidence may be one component of a clinical definition (e.g.,
toxic-shock syndrome). Most case definitions include a brief
clinical description; however, unless this description is
explicitly cited in the case classification section, it is
included only as background information. </p>
<p>Some diseases require laboratory confirmation for diagnosis
regardless of clinical symptoms, whereas others are diagnosed
based on epidemiologic data. Many case definitions for the
childhood vaccine-preventable diseases and foodborne diseases
include epidemiologic criteria (e.g., exposure to probable or
confirmed cases of disease or to a point source of infection
{i.e., a single source of infection, such as an event resulting in
a foodborne-disease outbreak, to which all confirmed case-patients
were exposed}). In some instances, the anatomic site of infection
may be important; for example, respiratory diphtheria is
notifiable, whereas cutaneous diphtheria is not. </p>
<p>Substantial amounts of information, including results of
laboratory tests, must be collected for many diseases before a
final case classification is possible. State health departments
should continue prompt reporting of provisional cases to CDC, and
records should be updated with the appropriate classification
status when additional surveillance information becomes available.
Cases should be categorized as laboratory-confirmed (a subset of
all confirmed cases) only if they meet the laboratory criteria
specified. For additional information about procedures for
reporting diseases to CDC, see the Manual of Procedures for the
Reporting of Nationally Notifiable Diseases to CDC (5). </p>
<p>Case definitions for some infectious conditions not
considered nationally notifiable also are included in this report.
Some of these conditions may have been nationally reportable or
may become so; definitions are included here to facilitate
interpretation of data for these diseases (<a href="00047449.htm#00002414.htm">Table_2</a>). State
 health
departments also provide CDC with information regarding certain
conditions of public health interest, whether nationally
reportable, through supplementary surveillance systems that
collect more detailed, condition-specific information (5). </p>
<p>The usefulness of public health surveillance data depends on
its uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness. The case definitions
contained in this report establish uniform criteria for disease
reporting and should not be used as the sole criteria for
establishing clinical diagnoses, determining the standard of care
necessary for a particular patient, setting guidelines for quality
assurance, or providing standards for reimbursement. Use of
additional clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data may enable
a physician to diagnose a disease even though the formal
surveillance case definition may not be met. </p>
<p>The list of nationally reportable infectious diseases changes
periodically. Diseases may be added to the list as new pathogens
emerge or deleted as their incidence declines. Public health
officials at state health departments and CDC collaborate in
determining which diseases should be nationally notifiable; CSTE,
in conjunction with CDC, makes recommendations annually for
additions and deletions to the list of nationally notifiable
diseases (1,2). As knowledge increases and diagnostic technology
improves, some definitions will change to reflect those trends.
Thus, future revisions can be expected. This report also is
available in AdobeTM AcrobatTM portable document format (.pdf)
through the World-Wide Web at
http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/other/case_def/about.html. Future
changes to the case definitions for nationally notifiable
infectious diseases will be announced in the MMWR and made
available in the electronic version. </p>
<p>How to Use Information in This Report </p>
<p>Terms that are used in case classifications for both Parts 1
and 2 are defined (see Definition of Terms Used in Case
 Classification).
Because each case definition in Parts 1 and 2 is intended to
stand alone, abbreviations are defined the first time they appear
in each case definition section and abbreviated throughout the
rest of that section. A publications list is included only for the
section on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); this list
provides further sources regarding AIDS. </p>
<p>These case definitions are to be used for identifying and
classifying cases, both of which are often done retrospectively,
for national reporting purposes. They should not be used as
criteria for public health action. For many conditions of public
health importance, action to contain disease should be initiated
as soon as a problem is identified; in many circumstances,
appropriate public health action should be undertaken even though
insufficient information is available to determine whether cases
meet the case definition. </p>
<br>
<p>Definition of Terms Used in Case Classification </p>
<p>Clinically compatible case: a clinical syndrome generally
compatible with the disease, as described in the clinical
description. </p>
<p>Confirmed case: a case that is classified as confirmed for
reporting purposes. </p>
<p>Epidemiologically linked case: a case in which a) the patient has
had contact with one or more persons who either have/had the
disease or have been exposed to a point source of infection (i.e.,
a single source of infection, such as an event leading to a
foodborne-disease outbreak, to which all confirmed case-patients
were exposed) and b) transmission of the agent by the usual modes
of transmission is plausible. A case may be considered
epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case if at
least one case in the chain of transmission is laboratory
confirmed. </p>
<p>Laboratory-confirmed case: a case that is confirmed by one or more
of the laboratory methods listed in the case definition under
Laboratory Criteria for Diagnosis. Although other laboratory
methods can be used in clinical diagnosis, only those listed are
accepted as laboratory confirmation for national reporting
purposes. </p>
<p>Probable case: a case that is classified as probable for reporting
purposes. </p>
<p>Supportive or presumptive laboratory results: specified laboratory
results that are consistent with the diagnosis, yet do not meet
the criteria for laboratory confirmation. </p>
<p>Suspected case: a case that is classified as suspected for
reporting purposes. </p>
<p>PART 1. CASE DEFINITIONS FOR NATIONALLY NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS
DISEASES
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) (Effective 1/1/93) </p>
<p>Case definition </p>
<p>CDC has expanded the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS) surveillance case definition to include all human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected adolescents and adults aged
greater than or equal to 13 years who have either a) less than 200
CD4+ T-lymphocytes/uL; b) a CD4+ T-lymphocyte percentage of total
lymphocytes of less than 14%; or c) any of the following three
clinical conditions: pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent pneumonia,
or invasive cervical cancer. The expanded definition retains the
23 clinical conditions in the AIDS surveillance case definition
published in 1987. (See publication {1} in Publications List in
this section for complete information referring to this case
definition.) </p>
<p>The AIDS surveillance case definition for children aged less
than 13 years has not changed and retains the clinical conditions
listed in the AIDS surveillance case definition published in 1987.
However, definitions for HIV encephalopathy, HIV wasting syndrome,
and HIV infection in children have been revised and the 1987
definition has been updated. (See Publication {2} in Publications
List for complete information pertaining to this case definition.) </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<p>See Publication (1) in Publications List. </p>
<p>Case classification </p>
<p>CDC has revised the classification system for HIV infection
to emphasize the clinical importance of the CD4+ T-lymphocyte
count in the categorization of HIV-related clinical conditions.
This classification system replaces the system published by CDC in
1986. (See Publication {1} in Publications List for complete
information pertaining to this case definition.) </p>

    </li>
    <li><p>
    Lepromatous: a number of erythematous papules and nodules or an
    infiltration of the face, hands, and feet with lesions in a
    bilateral and symmetrical distribution that progress to
 thickening
    of the skin </p>
    </li>

<p>Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), commonly referred to as
hantavirus disease, is a febrile illness characterized by
bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory
compromise usually requiring supplemental oxygen and clinically
resembling acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). The typical
prodrome consists of fever, chills, myalgia, headache, and
gastrointestinal symptoms. Typical clinical laboratory findings
include hemoconcentration, left shift in the white blood cell
count, neutrophilic leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and
circulating immunoblasts. </p>
<p>Clinical case definition </p>
<p>An illness characterized by one or more of the following
clinical features: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A febrile illness (i.e., temperature greater than 101.0 F
    {greater than 38.3 C}) characterized by bilateral diffuse
    interstitial edema that may radiographically resemble ARDS, with

    respiratory compromise requiring supplemental oxygen, developing

    within 72 hours of hospitalization, and occurring in a
 previously
    healthy person </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    An unexplained respiratory illness resulting in death, with an
    autopsy examination demonstrating noncardiogenic pulmonary edema

    without an identifiable cause </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Detection of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin M or rising
    titers of hantavirus-specific immunoglobulin G, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Detection of hantavirus-specific ribonucleic acid sequence by
    polymerase chain reaction in clinical specimens, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Detection of hantavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Laboratory testing should be performed or confirmed at a
reference laboratory. Because the clinical illness is nonspecific
and ARDS is common, a screening case definition can be used to
determine which patients to test. In general, a predisposing
medical condition (e.g., chronic pulmonary disease, malignancy,
trauma, burn, and surgery) is a more likely cause of ARDS than
HPS, and patients who have these underlying conditions and ARDS
need not be tested for hantavirus. </p>
<p>Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome, Postdiarrheal (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by the acute
onset of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, renal injury, and low
platelet count. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) also is
characterized by these features but can include central nervous
system (CNS) involvement and fever and may have a more gradual
onset. Most cases of HUS (but few cases of TTP) occur after an
acute gastrointestinal illness (usually diarrheal). </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<p>The following are both present at some time during the
illness: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Anemia (acute onset) with microangiopathic changes (i.e.,
    schistocytes, burr cells, or helmet cells) on peripheral blood
    smear and </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Renal injury (acute onset) evidenced by either hematuria,
    proteinuria, or elevated creatinine level (i.e., greater than or

    equal to 1.0 mg/dL in a child aged less than 13 years or greater

    than or equal to 1.5 mg/dL in a person aged greater than or
 equal
    to 13 years, or greater than or equal to 50% increase over
    baseline) </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A low platelet count can usually, but not always, be
detected early in the illness, but it may then become normal or
even high. If a platelet count obtained within 7 days after onset
of the acute gastrointestinal illness is not less than
150,000/mm3, other diagnoses should be considered. </p>
<p>Case classification
Probable: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    An acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP that meets the
    laboratory criteria in a patient who does not have a clear
 history
    of acute or bloody diarrhea in preceding 3 weeks or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    An acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP, that a) has onset
    within 3 weeks after onset of an acute or bloody diarrhea and b)

    meets the laboratory criteria except that microangiopathic
 changes
    are not confirmed </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmed: an acute illness diagnosed as HUS or TTP that both
meets the laboratory criteria and began within 3 weeks after onset
of an episode of acute or bloody diarrhea </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Some investigators consider HUS and TTP to be part of a
continuum of disease. Therefore, criteria for diagnosing TTP on
the basis of CNS involvement and fever are not provided because
cases diagnosed clinically as postdiarrheal TTP also should meet
the criteria for HUS. These cases are reported as postdiarrheal
HUS. </p>

<p>Comment </p>
<ol type="1">
    <li><p>
    Persons who have chronic hepatitis or persons identified as

    having acute viral hepatitis unless they have evidence of an
 acute
    illness compatible with viral hepatitis (with the exception of
    perinatal hepatitis B infection). (See Hepatitis, Viral,
 Perinatal
    Hepatitis B Virus Infection Acquired in the United States or
 U.S.
    Territories.) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Up to 20% of acute hepatitis C cases will be anti-HCV negative
    when reported and will be classified as non-A, non-B hepatitis
    because some (5%-10%) have not yet seroconverted and others
    (5%-10%) remain negative even with prolonged follow-up (6). </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Available serologic tests for anti-HCV do not distinguish

<p>Legionellosis (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Legionellosis is associated with two clinically and
epidemiologically distinct illnesses: Legionnaires disease, which
is characterized by fever, myalgia, cough, pneumonia, and Pontiac
fever, a milder illness without pneumonia. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Legionella from respiratory secretions, lung
    tissue, pleural fluid, or other normally sterile fluids, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of a fourfold or greater rise in the reciprocal
    immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) titer to greater than or equal

    to 128 against Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 between paired

    acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Detection of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 in respiratory
    secretions, lung tissue, or pleural fluid by direct fluorescent
    antibody testing, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of L. pneumophila serogroup 1 antigens in urine by

    radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>The previously used category of &quot;probable case,&quot; which was
based on a single IFA titer, lacks specificity for surveillance
and is no longer used. </p>
<p>Lyme Disease (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>A systemic, tickborne disease with protean manifestations,
including dermatologic, rheumatologic, neurologic, and cardiac
abnormalities. The best clinical marker for the disease is the
initial skin lesion (i.e., erythema migrans {EM}) that occurs in
60%-80% of patients. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Borrelia burgdorferi from a clinical specimen or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of diagnostic immunoglobulin M or immunoglobulin
    G antibodies to B. burgdorferi in serum or cerebrospinal fluid
    (CSF). A two-test approach using a sensitive enzyme immunoassay
 or
    immunofluorescence antibody followed by Western blot is
    recommended (7). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification </p>
<p>Confirmed: a) a case with EM or b) a case with at least one
late manifestation (as defined below) that is laboratory
confirmed. </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>This surveillance case definition was developed for national
reporting of Lyme disease; it is not intended to be used in
clinical diagnosis. </p>
<p>Definition of terms used in the clinical description and case
definition: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Erythema migrans. For purposes of surveillance, EM is defined as

    a skin lesion that typically begins as a red macule or papule
 and
    expands over a period of days to weeks to form a large round
    lesion, often with partial central clearing. A single primary
    lesion must reach greater than or equal to 5 cm in size.
 Secondary
    lesions also may occur. Annular erythematous lesions occurring
    within several hours of a tick bite represent hypersensitivity
    reactions and do not qualify as EM. For most patients, the
    expanding EM lesion is accompanied by other acute symptoms,
    particularly fatigue, fever, headache, mildly stiff neck,
    arthralgia, or myalgia. These symptoms are typically
 intermittent.
    The diagnosis of EM must be made by a physician. Laboratory
    confirmation is recommended for persons with no known exposure. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Late manifestations. Late manifestations include any of the
    following when an alternate explanation is not found: </p>
    </li>
    <ol type="1">
        <li><p>
        Musculoskeletal system. Recurrent, brief attacks (weeks
        or months) of objective joint swelling in one or a few
 joints,
        sometimes followed by chronic arthritis in one or a few
 joints.
        Manifestations not considered as criteria for diagnosis
 include
        chronic progressive arthritis not preceded by brief
 attacks and
        chronic symmetrical polyarthritis. Additionally,
 arthralgia,
        myalgia, or fibromyalgia syndromes alone are not criteria
 for
        musculoskeletal involvement. </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        Nervous system. Any of the following, alone or in
        combination: lymphocytic meningitis; cranial neuritis,
        particularly facial palsy (may be bilateral);
 radiculoneuropathy;
        or, rarely, encephalomyelitis. Encephalomyelitis must be
 confirmed
        by demonstration of antibody production against B.
 burgdorferi in
        the CSF, evidenced by a higher titer of antibody in CSF
 than in
        serum. Headache, fatigue, paresthesia, or mildly stiff
 neck alone
        are not criteria for neurologic involvement. </p>
        </li>
        <li><p>
        Cardiovascular system. Acute onset of high-grade
 (2nd-degree or
        3rd-degree) atrioventricular conduction defects that
        resolve in days to weeks and are sometimes associated with

        myocarditis. Palpitations, bradycardia, bundle branch
 block, or
        myocarditis alone are not criteria for cardiovascular
 involvement. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <li><p>
    Exposure. Exposure is defined as having been (less than or equal

    to 30 days before onset of EM) in wooded, brushy, or grassy
 areas
    (i.e., potential tick habitats) in a county in which Lyme
 disease
    is endemic. A history of tick bite is not required. </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Disease endemic to county. A county in which Lyme disease is
    endemic is one in which at least two confirmed cases have been
    previously acquired or in which established populations of a
 known
    tick vector are infected with B. burgdorferi. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Malaria (Revised 3/95)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms are variable; however, most patients
experience fever. In addition to fever, common associated symptoms
include headache, back pain, chills, sweats, myalgia, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea, and cough. Untreated Plasmodium falciparum
infection can lead to coma, renal failure, pulmonary edema, and
death. The diagnosis of malaria should be considered for any
person who has these symptoms and who has traveled to an area in
which malaria is endemic. Asymptomatic parasitemia can occur among
persons who have been long-term residents of areas in which
malaria is endemic. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of malaria parasites in blood films </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: an episode of microscopically confirmed malaria
parasitemia in any person (symptomatic or asymptomatic) diagnosed
in the United States, regardless of whether the person experienced
previous episodes of malaria while outside the country </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>A subsequent attack experienced by the same person but caused
by a different Plasmodium species is counted as an additional
case. A subsequent attack experienced by the same person and
caused by the same species in the United States may indicate a
relapsing infection or treatment failure caused by drug
resistance. </p>
<p>Blood smears from questionable cases should be referred to
the National Malaria Repository, CDC, for confirmation of the
diagnosis. </p>
<p>Cases also are classified according to the following World
Health Organization categories: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Autochthonous: </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Indigenous: malaria acquired by mosquito transmission in an </p>
<p>area where malaria is a regular occurrence
Introduced: malaria acquired by mosquito transmission from </p>
<p>an imported case in an area where malaria is not a regular
occurrence </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Imported: malaria acquired outside a specific area (e.g., the
    United States and its territories) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Induced: malaria acquired through artificial means (e.g., blood
    transfusion, common syringes, or malariotherapy) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Relapsing: renewed manifestation (i.e., of clinical symptoms
    and/or parasitemia) of malarial infection that is separated from

    previous manifestations of the same infection by an interval
    greater than any interval resulting from the normal periodicity
 of
    the paroxysms </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Cryptic: an isolated case of malaria that cannot be
    epidemiologically linked to additional cases </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Measles (Revised 9/96)
Clinical case definition </p>
<p>An illness characterized by all the following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    a generalized rash lasting greater than or equal to 3 days </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    a temperature greater than or equal to 101.0 F (greater than or
    equal to 38.3 C) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Positive serologic test for measles immunoglobulin M antibody,
    or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Significant rise in measles antibody level by any standard
    serologic assay, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of measles virus from a clinical specimen </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Suspected: any febrile illness accompanied by rash </p>
<p>Probable: a case that meets the clinical case definition, has
noncontributory or no serologic or virologic testing, and is not
epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case </p>
<p>Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the
clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a
confirmed case. A laboratory-confirmed case does not need to meet
the clinical case definition. </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Confirmed cases should be reported to NNDSS. An imported case
has its source outside the country or state. Rash onset occurs
within 18 days after entering the jurisdiction, and illness cannot
be linked to local transmission. Imported cases should be
classified as: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    International. A case that is imported from another country </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Out-of-State. A case that is imported from another state in the
    United States. The possibility that a patient was exposed within

    his or her state of residence should be excluded; therefore, the

    patient either must have been out of state continuously for the
    entire period of possible exposure (at least 7-18 days before
    onset of rash) or have had one of the following types of
 exposure
    while out of state: a) face-to-face contact with a person who
 had
    either a probable or confirmed case or b) attendance in the same

    institution as a person who had a case of measles (e.g., in a
    school, classroom, or day care center). </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>An indigenous case is defined as a case of measles that is
not imported. Cases that are linked to imported cases should be
classified as indigenous if the exposure to the imported case
occurred in the reporting state. Any case that cannot be proved to
be imported should be classified as indigenous. </p>
<p>Meningococcal Disease
Clinical description </p>
<p>Meningococcal disease manifests most commonly as meningitis
and/or meningococcemia that may progress rapidly to purpura
fulminans, shock, and death. However, other manifestations might
be observed. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Neisseria meningitidis from a normally sterile site

    (e.g., blood or cerebrospinal fluid {CSF} or, less commonly,
    joint, pleural, or pericardial fluid) </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a case with a positive antigen test in CSF or clinical
purpura fulminans in the absence of a positive blood culture </p>
<p>Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Positive antigen test results from urine or serum samples are
unreliable for diagnosing meningococcal disease. </p>
<p>Mumps (Revised 9/96)
Clinical case definition </p>
<p>An illness with acute onset of unilateral or bilateral
tender, self-limited swelling of the parotid or other salivary
gland, lasting greater than or equal to 2 days, and without other
apparent cause </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of mumps virus from clinical specimen, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Significant rise between acute- and convalescent-phase titers in

    serum mumps immunoglobulin G antibody level by any standard
    serologic assay, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Positive serologic test for mumps immunoglobulin M (IgM)
    antibody </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a case that meets the clinical case definition, has
noncontributory or no serologic or virologic testing, and is not
epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or probable case </p>
<p>Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed or that meets the
clinical case definition and is epidemiologically linked to a
confirmed or probable case. A laboratory-confirmed case does not
need to meet the clinical case definition. </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Two probable cases that are epidemiologically linked would be
considered confirmed, even in the absence of laboratory
confirmation. False-positive IgM results by immunofluorescent
antibody assays have been reported (8). </p>
<p>Pertussis (Revised 9/96)
Clinical case definition </p>
<p>A cough illness lasting greater than or equal to 2 weeks with
one of the following: paroxysms of coughing, inspiratory &quot;whoop,&quot;
or post-tussive vomiting, without other apparent cause </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Bordetella pertussis from clinical specimen or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Positive polymerase chain reaction for B. pertussis </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a case that meets the clinical case definition, is not
laboratory confirmed, and is not epidemiologically linked to a
laboratory-confirmed case </p>
<p>Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed or one that meets
the clinical case definition and is either laboratory confirmed or
epidemiologically linked to a laboratory-confirmed case </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>The clinical case definition is appropriate for endemic or
sporadic cases. In outbreak settings, a case may be defined as a
cough illness lasting greater than or equal to 2 weeks. Because
some studies have documented that direct fluorescent antibody
testing of nasopharyngeal secretions has low sensitivity and
variable specificity, it should not be relied on as a criterion
for laboratory confirmation (9,10). Serologic testing for
pertussis is available in some areas but is not standardized and,
therefore, should not be relied on as a criterion for laboratory
confirmation for national reporting purposes. Both probable and
confirmed cases should be reported to NNDSS. </p>
<p>Plague (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Plague is transmitted to humans by fleas or by direct
exposure to infected tissues or respiratory droplets; the disease
is characterized by fever, chills, headache, malaise, prostration,
and leukocytosis that manifests in one or more of the following
principal clinical forms: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Regional lymphadenitis (bubonic plague) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Septicemia without an evident bubo (septicemic plague) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Plague pneumonia, resulting from hematogenous spread in bubonic
    or septicemic cases (secondary pneumonic plague) or inhalation
 of
    infectious droplets (primary pneumonic plague) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenitis resulting from exposure
    to larger infectious droplets or ingestion of infected tissues
    (pharyngeal plague) </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis
Presumptive </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Elevated serum antibody titer(s) to Yersinia pestis fraction 1
    (F1) antigen (without documented fourfold or greater change) in
 a
    patient with no history of plague vaccination or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Detection of F1 antigen in a clinical specimen by fluorescent
    assay </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmatory </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Y. pestis from a clinical specimen or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Fourfold or greater change in serum antibody titer to Y. pestis
    F1 antigen </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Suspected: a clinically compatible case without presumptive or
confirmatory laboratory results </p>
<p>Probable: a clinically compatible case with presumptive laboratory
results </p>
<p>Confirmed: a clinically compatible case with confirmatory
laboratory results </p>
<p>Poliomyelitis, Paralytic
Clinical case definition </p>
<p>Acute onset of a flaccid paralysis of one or more limbs with
decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs, without
other apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss </p>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a case that meets the clinical case definition </p>
<p>Confirmed: a case that meets the clinical case definition and in
which the patient has a neurologic deficit 60 days after onset of
initial symptoms, has died, or has unknown follow-up status </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>All suspected cases of paralytic poliomyelitis are reviewed
by a panel of expert consultants before final classification
occurs. Confirmed cases are then further classified based on
epidemiologic and laboratory criteria (11). Only confirmed cases
are included in Table I in the MMWR. Suspected cases are
enumerated in a footnote to the MMWR table. </p>
<p>Psittacosis (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>An illness characterized by fever, chills, headache,
photophobia, cough, and myalgia </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of Chlamydia psittaci from respiratory secretions, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Fourfold or greater increase in antibody against C. psittaci by
    complement fixation or microimmunofluorescence (MIF) to a
    reciprocal titer of greater than or equal to 32 between paired
    acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Presence of immunoglobulin M antibody against C. psittaci by MIF

    to a reciprocal titer of greater than or equal to 16 </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically
linked to a confirmed case or that has supportive serology (e.g.,
C. psittaci titer of greater than or equal to 32 in one or more
serum specimens obtained after onset of symptoms) </p>
<p>Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>The serologic findings by CF also may occur as a result of
infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae or Chlamydia trachomatis. The
MIF might be more specific for infection with C. psittaci, but
experience with and availability of this newer test are more
limited. </p>
<p>Rabies, Animal
Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    A positive direct fluorescent antibody test (preferably
    performed on central nervous system tissue) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Isolation of rabies virus (in cell culture or in a laboratory
    animal) </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed </p>
<p>Rabies, Human
Clinical description </p>
<p>Rabies is an acute encephalomyelitis that almost always
progresses to coma or death within 10 days after the first

    Identification of a rabies-neutralizing antibody titer greater
    than or equal to 5 (complete neutralization) in the serum or CSF

    of an unvaccinated person. </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment
Laboratory confirmation by all of the above methods is strongly
recommended. </p>
<p>Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>A tickborne febrile illness most commonly characterized by
acute onset and usually accompanied by myalgia, headache, and
petechial rash (on the palms and soles in two thirds of the cases) </p>

neurosyphilis may include inflammatory lesions of the
cardiovascular system, skin, and bone. Rarely, other structures
(e.g., the upper and lower respiratory tracts, mouth, eye,
abdominal organs, reproductive organs, lymph nodes, and skeletal
muscle) may be involved. Late syphilis usually becomes clinically
manifest only after a period of 15-30 years of untreated
infection. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<p>Demonstration of T. pallidum in late lesions by fluorescent
antibody or special stains (although organisms are rarely
visualized in late lesions) </p>
<p>Case classification

cardiovascular system, skin, bone, or other structures with a
reactive treponemal test, in the absence of other known causes of
these abnormalities, and without CSF abnormalities and clinical
symptoms or signs consistent with neurosyphilis </p>
<p>Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>

<p>Syphilitic Stillbirth
Clinical description </p>
<p>A fetal death that occurs after a 20-week gestation or in
which the fetus weighs greater than 500 g and the mother had
untreated or inadequately treated@ syphilis at delivery </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>For reporting purposes, syphilitic stillbirths should be
reported as cases of congenital syphilis. </p>
<p>Syphilis, Congenital (Revised 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>A condition caused by infection in utero with Treponema
pallidum. A wide spectrum of severity exists, and only severe
cases are clinically apparent at birth. An infant or child (aged
less than 2 years) may have signs such as hepatosplenomegaly,
rash, condyloma lata, snuffles, jaundice (nonviral hepatitis),
pseudoparalysis, anemia, or edema (nephrotic syndrome and/or
malnutrition). An older child may have stigmata (e.g.,
interstitial keratitis, nerve deafness, anterior bowing of shins,
frontal bossing, mulberry molars, Hutchinson teeth, saddle nose,
rhagades, or Clutton joints). </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of T. pallidum by darkfield microscopy,
    fluorescent antibody, or other specific stains in specimens from

    lesions, placenta, umbilical cord, or autopsy material </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a condition affecting an infant whose mother had
untreated or inadequately treated@@ syphilis at delivery,
regardless of signs in the infant, or an infant or child who has
a reactive treponemal test for syphilis and any one of the
following: </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Any evidence of congenital syphilis on physical examination </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Any evidence of congenital syphilis on radiographs of long bones
 </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A reactive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) venereal disease research
    laboratory (VDRL) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    An elevated CSF cell count or protein (without other cause) </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    A reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed -- 19S-IgM
    antibody test or IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Confirmed: a case that is laboratory confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Congenital and acquired syphilis may be difficult to
distinguish when a child is seropositive after infancy. Signs of
congenital syphilis may not be obvious, and stigmata may not yet
have developed. Abnormal values for CSF VDRL, cell count, and
protein, as well as IgM antibodies, may be found in either
congenital or acquired syphilis. Findings on radiographs of long
bones may help because radiographic changes in the metaphysis and
epiphysis are considered classic signs of congenitally acquired
syphilis. The decision may ultimately be based on maternal history
and clinical judgment. In a young child, the possibility of sexual
abuse should be considered as a cause of acquired rather than
congenital syphilis, depending on the clinical picture. For
reporting purposes, congenital syphilis includes cases of
congenitally acquired syphilis among infants and children as well
as syphilitic stillbirths. </p>

<p>PART 2. CASE DEFINITIONS FOR NON-NOTIFIABLE INFECTIOUS DISEASES
Amebiasis
Clinical description </p>
<p>Infection of the large intestine by Entamoeba histolytica may
result in an illness of variable severity ranging from mild,
chronic diarrhea to fulminant dysentery. Infection also may be
asymptomatic. Extraintestinal infection also can occur (e.g.,
hepatic abscess). </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis
Intestinal amebiasis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of cysts or trophozoites of E. histolytica in

    scrapings by culture or histopathology </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Extraintestinal amebiasis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Demonstration of E. histolytica trophozoites in extraintestinal
    tissue </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification

enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>Asymptomatic intestinal carriage of E. histolytica should not
be reported. Among asymptomatic persons, a positive serologic test
does not necessarily indicate extraintestinal amebiasis. </p>
<p>Aseptic Meningitis
Clinical description </p>
<p>A syndrome characterized by acute onset of meningeal
symptoms, fever, and cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, with
bacteriologically sterile cultures </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    No evidence of bacterial or fungal meningitis </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Confirmed: a clinically compatible case diagnosed by a physician
as aseptic meningitis, with no laboratory evidence of bacterial or
fungal meningitis. </p>
<p>Comment </p>

many cases are caused by a viral agent. </p>
<p>Bacterial Meningitis, Other (Adopted 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>Bacterial meningitis manifests most commonly with fever,
headache, and a stiff neck; the disease may progress rapidly to
shock and death. However, other manifestations may be observed. </p>

 polymerase
    chain reaction) in stool, duodenal/jejunal aspirates or
    small-bowel biopsy specimens </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a clinically compatible case that is epidemiologically
linked to a confirmed case </p>

(less than or equal to 100,000/mm3), and evidence of plasma
leakage documented by hemoconcentration (hematocrit increased by
greater than or equal to 20%) or other objective evidence of
increased capillary permeability. The definition of dengue shock
syndrome follows all of the above criteria for dengue hemorrhagic
fever and also includes hypotension or narrow pulse pressure (less
than or equal to 20 mm Hg). </p>
<p>Ehrlichiosis (Adopted 9/96)
Clinical description </p>
<p>A tickborne febrile illness most commonly characterized by
acute onset, accompanied by headache, myalgia, rigors and/or
malaise. Clinical laboratory findings may include intracytoplasmic
microcolonies (morulae) in leukocytes of peripheral smear,
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or bone marrow aspirate or biopsy,
cytopenias (especially thrombocytopenia and leukopenia), and
elevated liver enzymes (especially alanine aminotransferase or
aspartate aminotransferase). </p>
<p>There are two clinically similar yet serologically distinct
forms of ehrlichiosis: a) human granulocytic ehrlichosis (HGE),
caused by infection with an Ehrlichia equi-like agent and found
primarily in the upper midwest and northeast, and b) human
monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis
infection and found primarily in the southeastern quadrant of the
United States. </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>
<ul>
    <li><p>
    Fourfold or greater change in antibody titer to Ehrlichia spp.
    antigen by immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) test in acute- and
    convalescent-phase specimens ideally taken greater than or equal

    to 4 weeks apart. HME diagnosis requires E. chaffeensis and HGE
    currently requires E. equi or HGE-agent antigen, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Positive polymerase chain reaction assay. Distinct primers are
    used for the diagnosis of HGE and HME, or </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>
    Intracytoplasmic morulae identified in blood, bone marrow, or
    CSF leukocytes, and an IFA antibody titer greater than or equal
 to
    64 </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Case classification
Probable: a clinically compatible case with either a single IFA
serologic titer greater than or equal to 64 or intracytoplasmic
morulae identified in blood, bone marrow, or CSF leukocytes </p>
<p>Confirmed: a clinically compatible case that is laboratory
confirmed </p>
<p>Comment </p>
<p>All laboratory testing should be conducted by experienced
personnel with appropriate training and should include appropriate
controls and reagents necessary for accurate etiologic diagnosis.
States in which cases of HGE and/or HME have occurred may submit
reports to CDC. </p>

Minor criteria: a) previous rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart
disease; b) arthralgia; c) fever; d) elevated erythrocyte
sedimentation rate, positive C-reactive protein, or leukocytosis;
and e) prolonged PR interval on an electrocardiogram </p>
<p>Laboratory criteria for diagnosis </p>

<p>Supporting evidence to confirm streptococcal infection
includes increased antistreptolysin-O or other streptococcal
antibodies, throat culture positive for group A streptococcus, or
recent scarlet fever. The absence of supporting evidence of
preceding streptococcal infection should make the diagnosis
doubtful, except in Sydenham chorea or low-grade carditis when
rheumatic fever is first discovered after a long latent period
from the antecedent infection. </p>

        by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and used according to
        the approved product labeling on the package insert. Current
