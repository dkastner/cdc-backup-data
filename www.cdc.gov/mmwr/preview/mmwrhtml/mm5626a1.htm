<H1>Turtle-Associated Salmonellosis in Humans --- United States, 2006--2007</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Turtles and other reptiles are reservoirs of 
<I>Salmonella</I> and have long been a recognized source of 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection in humans (<I>1</I>). Small turtles have posed a particular danger to young children because these turtles might not be perceived 
as health hazards and can be handled like toys. 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections in children can be severe and can result in 
hospitalization and occasionally in death 
(<I>2</I>). The association between 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection in children and exposure to turtles led to a 
1975 law prohibiting the sale or distribution of small turtles (i.e., those with a carapace of &lt;4 inches in length) in the United 
States (<I>3</I>). That prohibition led to a substantial 
decline in human salmonellosis cases associated with turtles 
(<I>4</I>). However, because the prohibition is not fully enforced and contains exceptions (e.g., sales for educational purposes), human 
turtle-associated cases continue to occur. This report describes several recent cases of turtle-associated salmonellosis reported to CDC by 
state and local health departments since September 2006, including a fatal case in an infant. These cases illustrate that small 
turtles remain a source of human <I>Salmonella</I> infections. Although ongoing public education measures aimed at preventing 
reptile-acquired <I>Salmonella</I> infections are helpful, prohibiting the sale of small turtles likely remains the most effective public 
health action to prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.
<H4>
<B><I>Salmonella</I> Pomona Infections --- Multiple States</B>
</H4>
</P><P>On February 20, 2007, a female infant aged 3 weeks with a 1-day history of poor feeding and lethargy was evaluated in 
an emergency department at a Florida hospital. The patient was transferred immediately to a tertiary-care pediatric hospital; 
on arrival, she was febrile and in septic shock. Antibiotics were administered. She died on March 1. Cultures 
of cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples yielded 
<I>Salmonella</I> serotype Pomona.
</P><P>The parents of the patient were interviewed by the Florida 
Department of Health. A family friend had purchased a 
small turtle with a carapace of 1.25 inches from a flea market in north central Florida in mid-November 2006. The turtle 
was purchased as a pet and given to the patient's family in late January 2007. After the death of the infant, laboratory testing of 
the turtle and its environment was performed by the Florida Bureau of Laboratories. A fecal sample from the turtle yielded 
<I>S</I>. Pomona. The <I>S</I>. Pomona isolates from the patient and the 
turtle were indistinguishable by pulsed-field gel 
electrophoresis (PFGE).
</P><P>A total of 19 other <I>S</I>. Pomona isolates from 19 patients in 11 states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, 
Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Texas) with a PFGE pattern closely related to the 
isolate from the Florida patient and turtle were submitted to PulseNet,* with isolation dates ranging from October 2, 2006 to 
April 23, 2007. To determine whether these cases of 
<I>S</I>. Pomona infection were associated with turtle exposure, CDC staff, 
through OutbreakNet,<SUP>&#134;</SUP> coordinated an investigation with state and city health departments, which conducted 
interviews with patients or their parents or 
guardians. The median age of patients was 3 years (range: 2 months--59 years). Illness onsets 
occurred during September 30, 2006--April 23, 2007. Of the 15 interviewed patients, 12 (80%) had direct or indirect contact with 
a turtle within 7 days before illness onset. Among those 12 patients, nine (75%) had turtles as household pets. The duration 
of turtle ownership before illness onset ranged from &lt;1 month to 
approximately 5 years. Among the six patients for 
whom purchase information was available, all had purchased small turtles as pets from flea markets or pet shops. Carapace size 
at time of purchase was not reported. No common vendor was 
identified.
<H4>
<B><I>Salmonella</I> I 4,[5],12:i:- Infections --- Ohio and Tennessee</B>
</H4>
</P><P><b>Ohio.</b> In September 2006, a previously healthy boy aged 
8 years had onset of bloody diarrhea with cramping, 
headache, vomiting, and fever of 
101.0<SUP>&#176;</SUP>F (38.3<SUP>&#176;</SUP>C). The Ohio 
Department of Health Laboratory isolated <I>Salmonella 
</I>I 4,[5],12:i:- from a stool specimen. The patient recovered at home after 3 days. No family member reported a similar illness while the patient 
was ill. However, the next month, the patient's brother, aged 12 years, had onset of bloody diarrhea; a stool specimen 
yielded <I>Salmonella</I> I 4,[5],12:i:-.
</P><P>Two weeks before the first patient became ill, the family had purchased three red-eared slider turtles as pets, each with 
a carapace of &lt;4 inches, at a flea market in southeastern 
Kentucky. The Ohio Department of Agriculture Laboratory 
isolated <I>Salmonella </I>from the coelomic contents of the turtles and a water sample from the turtles' aquarium. The isolates 
were serotyped at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's 
National Veterinary Services Laboratory; the turtle isolates were 
<I>Salmonella</I> I 

4,[5],12:i:-, <I>S</I>. Litchfield, and <I>S</I>. Infantis, and the water sample isolate was 
<I>S</I>. Infantis. The <I>Salmonella</I> I 4,[5],12:i:- 
isolates from the patients and turtles were indistinguishable by PFGE performed at the Ohio Department of Health Laboratory.
</P><P><b>Tennessee.</b> In September 2006, a previously healthy woman aged 45 years was hospitalized with diarrhea, chills, fever 
of 102.8<SUP>&#176;</SUP>F (39.3<SUP>&#176;</SUP>C), abdominal cramps, myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting of 24 hours' duration. The patient was 
treated with antibiotics and intravenous fluids and released 
after 3 days. A stool specimen yielded 
<I>Salmonella</I> I 4,[5],12:i:-. The patient became ill less than 2 weeks after her son, aged 
7 years, received two small red-eared slider turtles, both with carapaces of 
&lt;2 inches, as a gift from family friends who had purchased them in Florida from an unknown vendor. The child also had onset 
of diarrhea shortly after receiving the turtles, but no specimens were collected during his illness.
</P><P>County health officials visited the patient's home and collected a stool specimen from the child, an external surface 
swab from both turtles, and a water sample from the aquarium. Specimens from the child and turtles yielded 
<I>Salmonella</I> I 4,[5],12:i:- isolates, which were indistinguishable from the mother's isolate based on PFGE performed at the 
Tennessee Department of Health Laboratory. The aquarium water sample yielded 
<I>Salmonella</I> Pomona.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P> <I>Salmonella</I> illness remains a major public health problem in the United States, with an estimated 1.4 
million nontyphoidal human <I>Salmonella</I> infections occurring annually, resulting in approximately 15,000 hospitalizations and 
400 deaths (<I>5</I>). Reptiles are a well-established source of human salmonellosis; a study conducted during 1996--1997 attributed 
an estimated 6% of all human, laboratory-confirmed, sporadic 
<I>Salmonella</I> infections in the United States (and 11% of 
infections among persons aged &lt;21 years) to contact with reptiles and amphibians 
(<I>6</I>). The epidemiologic and laboratory findings 
from the investigations described in this report demonstrate that turtles were the likely source of infection in these 
human salmonellosis cases. Exposure to turtles was associated with salmonellosis, and identical PFGE 
<I>Salmonella</I> strains were isolated from samples from patients and their turtles in three separate instances. Nontyphoidal 
human <I>Salmonella</I> illnesses in the United States are common and usually sporadic; therefore, many cases of 
turtle-associated human salmonellosis likely occur without detection or without a recognized link to exposure to turtles. 
</P><P>Despite a federal law prohibiting the sale or distribution of small turtles as pets, such sales still occur. 
<I>Salmonella</I> can be transmitted to humans by direct or indirect contact with a turtle or its feces. No reliable methods are available to 
guarantee that a turtle is free of 
<I>Salmonella</I>. Most turtles are colonized with 
<I>Salmonella </I>and shed the bacteria intermittently in their 
feces. Certain techniques to eliminate <I>Salmonella 
</I>from turtles have been unsuccessful and have resulted in 
<I>Salmonella </I>isolates with increased antibiotic resistance 
(<I>7</I>). In addition, turtles not shedding <I>Salmonella 
</I>species under normal circumstances have been shown to actively shed the bacteria when stressed 
(<I>8</I>). Moreover, water in turtle bowls or aquariums 
can amplify any <I>Salmonella</I> shed by turtles. For these reasons, all turtles, regardless of carapace size, should be handled as though they 
are infected with <I>Salmonella</I>. 
</P><P>In 1980, CDC estimated that the 1975 federal prohibition of the sale of small turtles in the United States had prevented 
an estimated 100,000 cases of turtle-associated salmonellosis in children aged 1--9 years in 1976 
(<I>4</I>). These additional cases might have resulted in approximately 1,500 hospitalizations and 40 deaths that year 
(<I>4--6</I>). Reductions in human illnesses associated with turtle-associated 
<I>Salmonella </I>strains were observed in other countries when similar small turtle sale 
prohibitions were enacted (<I>9,10</I>). When Sweden joined the 
European Union in 1996 and sale prohibitions were repealed, the number 
of human salmonellosis cases from reptile-associated 
<I>Salmonella </I>strains increased substantially, with 
children being most affected (<I>9</I>).
</P><P>The recent cases of turtle-associated human salmonellosis described in this report emphasize the need for 
improved prevention measures. Public education aimed at preventing 
reptile-acquired <I>Salmonella</I> infections is ongoing in the 
United States (<a href = "mm5626a1.htm#box">Box</a>). After identification of the cluster of 
<I>Salmonella</I> Pomona infections and the fatal case in the infant 
described in this report, the Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer advisory update, available at 
		<a href="http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/turtles042307.html">http://www.fda.gov/consumer/updates/turtles042307.html</a>, emphasizing the risks for salmonellosis associated with small pet turtles. Consumers 
were reminded of recommendations for reducing the risk for 
<I>Salmonella</I> infection from all reptiles, which include washing 
hands 

with soap and water after handling reptiles or their cages and keeping reptiles out of food-preparation areas. CDC 
has published similar recommendations, available at 
		<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/spotlight_an_turtles.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/spotlight_an_turtles.htm</a>. Such 
education measures are helpful, but prohibiting the sale of small turtles likely remains the most effective public health action to 
prevent turtle-associated salmonellosis.
