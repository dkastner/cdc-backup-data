<B><I>Summary</I></B>
</H3>
<P><I> CDC, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the American Society 
of Blood and Marrow Transplantation have cosponsored these guidelines 
for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) among hematopoietic stem 
cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. The guidelines were drafted with the assistance of 
a working group of experts in infectious diseases, transplantation, and public 
health. For the purposes of this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood- 
or marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type 
(i.e., allogeneic or autologous) or cell source (i.e., bone marrow, peripheral blood, 
or placental or umbilical cord blood). Such OIs as bacterial, viral, fungal, 
protozoal, and helminth infections occur with increased frequency or severity among 
HSCT recipients. These evidence-based guidelines contain information 
regarding preventing OIs, hospital infection control, strategies for safe living 
after transplantation, vaccinations, and hematopoietic stem cell safety. The 
disease-specific sections address preventing exposure and disease for pediatric and 
adult and autologous and allogeneic HSCT recipients. The goal of these guidelines 
is twofold: to summarize current data and provide evidence-based 
recommendations regarding preventing OIs among HSCT patients. The guidelines 
were developed for use by HSCT recipients, their household and close 
contacts, transplant and infectious diseases physicians, HSCT center personnel, and 
public health professionals. For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated 
by the strength of the recommendation and the quality of the evidence 
supporting the recommendation. Adhering to these guidelines should reduce the number 
and severity of OIs among HSCT recipients.</I>
<H3>
<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
</H3>
<P>In 1992, the Institute of Medicine (<I>1</I>) recommended that CDC lead a global effort 
to detect and control emerging infectious agents. In response, CDC published a plan 
(<I>2</I>) that outlined national disease prevention priorities, including the development of 
guidelines for preventing opportunistic infections (OIs) among immunosuppressed persons. 
During 1995, CDC published guidelines for preventing OIs among persons infected with 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and revised those guidelines during 1997 and 1999 
(<I>3--5</I>). Because of the success of those guidelines, CDC sought to determine the need for 
expanding OI prevention activities to other immunosuppressed populations. An 
informal survey of hematology, oncology, and infectious disease specialists at transplant 
centers and a working group formed by CDC determined that guidelines were needed to 
help prevent OIs among hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)* recipients.
</P><P>The working group defined OIs as infections that occur with increased frequency 
or severity among HSCT recipients, and they drafted evidence-based 
recommendations for preventing exposure to and disease caused by bacterial, fungal, viral, protozoal, 
or helminthic pathogens. During March 1997, the working group presented the first draft 
of these guidelines at a meeting of representatives from public and private health 
organizations. After review by that group and other experts, these guidelines were revised 
and made available during September 1999 for a 45-day public comment period after 
notification in the <I>Federal Register</I>. Public comments were added when feasible, and 
the report was approved by CDC, the Infectious Disease Society of America, and the 
American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The pediatric content of these 
guidelines has been endorsed also by the American Academy of Pediatrics. The 
hematopoietic stem cell safety section was endorsed by the International Society of 
Hematotherapy and Graft Engineering.
</P><P>The first recommendations presented in this report are followed by 
recommendations for hospital infection control, strategies for safe living, vaccinations, and
hematopoietic stem cell safety. Unless otherwise noted, these recommendations address 
allogeneic and autologous and pediatric and adult HSCT recipients. Additionally, these 
recommendations are intended for use by the recipients, their household and other 
close contacts, transplant and infectious diseases specialists, HSCT center personnel, 
and public health professionals.
</P><h4>
<B>Using These Guidelines</B>
</h4><P>For all recommendations, prevention strategies are rated by the strength of the 
recommendation (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>) and the quality of the evidence (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>) supporting the 
recommendation. The principles of this rating system were developed by the Infectious 
Disease Society of America and the U.S. Public Health Service for use in the guidelines 
for preventing OIs among HIV-infected persons 
(<I>3--6</I>). This rating system allows assessments of recommendations to which adherence is critical.
<H3>
<B>BACKGROUND</B>
</H3>
<P>HSCT is the infusion of hematopoietic stem cells from a donor into a patient who 
has received chemotherapy, which is usually marrow-ablative. Increasingly, HSCT has 
been used to treat neoplastic diseases, hematologic disorders, immunodeficiency 
syndromes, congenital enzyme deficiencies, and autoimmune disorders (e.g., systemic lupus 
erythematosus or multiple sclerosis) (<I>7--10</I>). Moreover, HSCT has become standard 
treatment for selected conditions (<I>7,11,12</I>). Data from the International Bone Marrow 
Transplant 

Registry and the Autologous Blood and Marrow Transplant Registry indicate that 
approximately 20,000 HSCTs were performed in North America during 1998 
(Statistical Center of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry and Autologous Blood 
and Marrow Transplant Registry, unpublished data, 1998).
</P><P>HSCTs are classified as either allogeneic or autologous on the basis of the source 
of the transplanted hematopoietic progenitor cells. Cells used in allogeneic HSCTs are 
harvested from a donor other than the transplant recipient. Such transplants are the 
most effective treatment for persons with severe aplastic anemia 
(<I>13</I>) and offer the only curative therapy for persons with chronic myelogenous leukemia 
(<I>12</I>). Allogeneic donors might be a blood relative or an unrelated donor. Allogeneic transplants are 
usually most successful when the donor is a human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-identical twin 
or matched sibling. However, for allogeneic candidates who lack such a donor, 
registry organizations (e.g., the National Marrow Donor Program) maintain computerized 
databases that store information regarding HLA type from millions of volunteer donors 
(<I>14--16</I>). Another source of stem cells for allogeneic candidates without an 
HLA-matched sibling is a mismatched family member 
(<I>17,18</I>). However, persons who receive 
allogeneic grafts from donors who are not HLA-matched siblings are at a substantially 
greater risk for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 
(<I>19</I>). These persons are also at increased 
risk for suboptimal graft function and delayed immune system recovery 
(<I>19</I>). To reduce GVHD among allogeneic HSCTs, techniques have been developed to remove 
T-lymphocytes, the principal effectors of GVHD, from the donor graft. Although the recipients of 
T-lymphocyte--depleted marrow grafts generally have lower rates of GVHD, they 
also have greater rates of graft rejection, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, invasive 
fungal infection, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated posttransplant 
lymphoproliferative disease (<I>20</I>).
</P><P>The patient's own cells are used in an autologous HSCT. Similar to autologous 
transplants are syngeneic transplants, among whom the HLA-identical twin serves as 
the donor. Autologous HSCTs are preferred for patients who require high-level or 
marrow-ablative chemotherapy to eradicate an underlying malignancy but have 
healthy, undiseased bone marrows. Autologous HSCTs are also preferred when the 
immunologic antitumor effect of an allograft is not beneficial. Autologous HSCTs are used most 
frequently to treat breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease 
(<I>21</I>). Neither autologous nor syngeneic HSCTs confer a risk for chronic GVHD.
</P><P>Recently, medical centers have begun to harvest hematopoietic stem cells from 
placental or umbilical cord blood (UCB) immediately after birth. These harvested cells 
are used primarily for allogeneic transplants among children. Early results demonstrate 
that greater degrees of histoincompatibility between donor and recipient might be 
tolerated without graft rejection or GVHD when UCB hematopoietic cells are used 
(<I>22--24</I>). However, immune system function after UCB transplants has not been well-studied.
</P><P>HSCT is also evolving rapidly in other areas. For example, hematopoietic stem 
cells harvested from the patient's peripheral blood after treatment with hematopoietic 
colony-stimulating factors (e.g., granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF or filgastrim] 
or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF or sargramostim]) are 
being used increasingly among autologous recipients 
(<I>25</I>) and are under investigation for use among allogeneic HSCT. Peripheral blood has largely replaced bone marrow as 
a source of stem cells for autologous recipients. A benefit of harvesting such cells from 
the donor's peripheral blood instead of bone marrow is that it eliminates the need for 
general anesthesia associated with bone marrow aspiration.
</P><P>GVHD is a condition in which the donated cells recognize the recipient's cells as 
nonself and attack them. Although the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in the 
routine management of allogeneic patients was common in the past as a means of 
producing immune modulation among patients with GVHD, this practice has declined 
because of cost factors (<I>26</I>) and because of the development of other strategies for GVHD 
prophylaxis (<I>27</I>). For example, use of cyclosporine GVHD prophylaxis has become 
commonplace since its introduction during the early 1980s. Most frequently, cyclosporine 
or tacrolimus (FK506) is administered in combination with other immunosuppressive 
agents (e.g., methotrexate or corticosteroids) 
(<I>27</I>). Although cyclosporine is effective in 
preventing GVHD, its use entails greater hazards for infectious complications and relapse 
of the underlying neoplastic disease for which the transplant was performed.
</P><P>Although survival rates for certain autologous recipients have improved 
(<I>28,29</I>), infection remains a leading cause of death among allogeneic transplants and is a 
major cause of morbidity among autologous HSCTs 
(<I>29</I>). Researchers from the National Marrow Donor Program reported that, of 462 persons receiving unrelated allogeneic 
HSCTs during December 1987--November 1990, a total of 66% had died by 1991 
(<I>15</I>). Among primary and secondary causes of death, the most common cause was infection, 
which occurred among 37% of 307 patients 
(<I>15</I>).**
</P><P>Despite high morbidity and mortality after HSCT, recipients who survive 
long-term are likely to enjoy good health. A survey of 798 persons who had received an 
HSCT before 1985 and who had survived for &gt;5 years after HSCT, determined that 93% 
were in good health and that 89% had returned to work or school full time 
(<I>30</I>). In another survey of 125 adults who had survived a mean of 10 years after HSCT, 88% 
responded that the benefits of transplantation outweighed the side effects 
(<I>31</I>).
</P><h4>
<B>Immune System Recovery After HSCT</B>
</h4><P>During the first year after an HSCT, recipients typically follow a predictable pattern 
of immune system deficiency and recovery, which begins with the chemotherapy or 
radiation therapy (i.e., the conditioning regimen) administered just before the HSCT to 
treat the underlying disease. Unfortunately, this conditioning regimen also destroys 
normal hematopoiesis for neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages and damages 
mucosal progenitor cells, causing a temporary loss of mucosal barrier integrity. The 
gastrointestinal tract, which normally contains bacteria, commensal fungi, and other 
bacteria-carrying sources (e.g., skin or mucosa) becomes a reservoir of potential pathogens. 
Virtually all HSCT recipients rapidly lose all T- and B-lymphocytes after conditioning, losing 
immune memory accumulated through a lifetime of exposure to infectious agents, 
environmental antigens, and vaccines. Because transfer of donor immunity to HSCT recipients 
is variable and influenced by the timing of antigen exposure among donor and 
recipient, passively acquired donor immunity cannot be relied upon to provide long-term 
immunity against infectious diseases among HSCT recipients.
</P><P>During the first month after HSCT, the major host-defense deficits include 
impaired phagocytosis and damaged mucocutaneous barriers. Additionally, indwelling 
intravenous catheters are frequently placed and left in situ for weeks to administer 
parenteral medications, blood products, and nutritional supplements. These catheters serve as 
another portal of entry for opportunistic pathogens from organisms colonizing the skin 
(e.g., 
             <FONT

</FONT>
coagulase-negative <I>Staphylococci</I>, <I>Staphylococcus 
aureus</I>, <I>Candida</I> species, and 
<I>Enterococci</I>) (<I>32,33</I>).
</P><P>Engraftment for adults and children is defined as the point at which a patient 
can maintain a sustained absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 
&gt;500/mm<SUP>3</SUP> and sustained platelet count of 
<U>&gt;</U>20,000, lasting <U>&gt;</U>3 consecutive days without transfusions. Among 
unrelated allogeneic recipients, engraftment occurs at a median of 22 days after HSCT (range: 
6--84 days) (<I>15</I>). In the absence of corticosteroid use, engraftment is associated with 
the restoration of effective phagocytic function, which results in a decreased risk for 
bacterial and fungal infections. However, all HSCT recipients and particularly allogeneic 
recipients, experience an immune system dysfunction for months after engraftment. For  
example, although allogeneic recipients might have normal total lymphocyte counts 
within <U>&gt;</U>2 months after HSCT, they have abnormal CD4/CD8 T-cell ratios, reflecting their 
decreased CD4 and increased CD8 T-cell counts 
(<I>27</I>). They might also have immunoglobulin G 
(IgG)<SUB>2</SUB>, IgG<SUB>4</SUB>, and immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiencies for months after HSCT and 
have difficulty switching from immunoglobulin M (IgM) to IgG production after antigen 
exposure (<I>32</I>). Immune system recovery might be delayed further by CMV infection 
(<I>34</I>).
</P><P>During the first <U>&gt;</U>2 months after HSCT, recipients might experience acute GVHD 
that manifests as skin, gastrointestinal, and liver injury, and is graded on a scale of 
I--IV (<I>32,35,36</I>). Although autologous or syngeneic recipients might occasionally experience 
a mild, self-limited illness that is acute GVHD-like 
(<I>19,37</I>), GVHD occurs primarily among allogeneic recipients, particularly those receiving matched, unrelated donor 
transplants. GVHD is a substantial risk factor for infection among HSCT recipients because it is 
associated with a delayed immunologic recovery and prolonged immunodeficiency 
(<I>19</I>). Additionally, the immunosuppressive agents used for GVHD prophylaxis and 
treatment might make the HSCT recipient more vulnerable to opportunistic viral and fungal 
pathogens (<I>38</I>).
</P><P>Certain patients, particularly adult allogeneic recipients, might also experience 
chronic GVHD, which is graded as either limited or extensive chronic GVHD 
(<I>19,39</I>). Chronic GVHD appears similar to autoimmune, connective-tissue disorders (e.g., scleroderma 
or systemic lupus erythematosus) (<I>40</I>) and is associated with cellular and humoral 
immunodeficiencies, including macrophage deficiency, impaired neutrophil chemotaxis 
(<I>41</I>), poor response to vaccination 
(<I>42--44</I>), and severe mucositis (<I>19</I>). Risk factors for 
chronic GVHD include increasing age, allogeneic HSCT (particularly those among whom 
the donor is unrelated or a non-HLA identical family member) 
(<I>40</I>), and a history of acute GVHD 
(<I>24,45</I>). Chronic GVHD was first described as occurring &gt;100 days after HSCT 
but can occur 40 days after HSCT (<I>19</I>). Although allogeneic recipients with chronic 
GVHD have normal or high total serum immunoglobulin levels 
(<I>41</I>), they experience long-lasting IgA, IgG, and IgG subclass deficiencies 
(<I>41,46,47</I>) and poor opsonization and impaired reticuloendothelial function. Consequently, they are at even greater risk for 
infections (<I>32,39</I>), particularly life-threatening bacterial infections from encapsulated 
organisms (e.g., <I>Stre. pneumoniae</I>, <I>Ha. 
influenzae</I>, or <I>Ne. meningitidis</I>). After chronic 
GVHD resolves, which might take years, cell-mediated and humoral immunity function 
are gradually restored.
</P><h4>
<B>Opportunistic Pathogens After HSCT</B>
</h4><P>HSCT recipients experience certain infections at different times posttransplant, 
reflecting the predominant host-defense defect(s) (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#fig1">Figure</a>). Immune system recovery 
for 

HSCT recipients takes place in three phases beginning at day 0, the day of 
transplant. Phase I is the preengraftment phase (&lt;30 days after HSCT); phase II, the 
postengraftment phase (30--100 days after HSCT); and phase III, the late phase (&gt;100 days after 
HSCT). Prevention strategies should be based on these three phases and the following 
information:
<UL>
<LI> <B>Phase I, 
preengraftment.</B> During the first month posttransplant, 
HSCT recipients have two critical risk factors for infection --- prolonged neutropenia 
and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier resulting from the HSCT 
preparative regimens and frequent vascular access required for patient care. 
Consequently, oral, gastro-intestinal, and skin flora are sources of infection. Prevalent 
pathogens include <I>Candida</I> species, and as neutropenia continues, 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species. Additionally, herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation can occur during this 
phase. During preengraftment, the risks for infection are the same for autologous 
or allogeneic patients, and OIs can appear as febrile neutropenia. Although 
a recipient's first fever during preengraftment is probably caused by a 
bacterial pathogen, rarely is an organism or site of infection identified. Instead, 
such infections are usually treated preemptively or empirically 
(<I>48</I>) until the neutropenia resolves 
(<I>49</I>). Growth factors can be administered during phase I 
to decrease neutropenia duration and complications (e.g., febrile neutropenia) 
(<I>50</I>).
<LI> <B>Phase II, 
postengraftment.</B> Phase II is dominated by impaired 
cell-mediated immunity for allogeneic or autologous recipients. Scope and impact of this 
defect for allogeneic recipients are determined by the extent of GVHD and 
its immunosuppressive therapy. After engraftment, the herpes viruses, 
particularly CMV, are critical pathogens. At 30--100 days after HSCT, CMV causes 
pneumonia, hepatitis, and colitis and potentiates superinfection with opportunistic 
pathogens, particularly among patients with active GVHD. Other dominant pathogens 
during this phase include <I>Pneumocystis 
carinii</I> and <I>Aspergillus</I> species.
<LI> <B>Phase III, late phase.</B> During phase III, autologous recipients usually have 
more rapid recovery of immune system function and, therefore, a lower risk for OIs 
than do allogeneic recipients. Because of cell-mediated and humoral immunity 
defects and impaired reticuloendothelial system function, allogeneic patients with 
chronic GVHD and recipients of alternate donor allogeneic transplants are at risk 
for certain infections during this phase. Alternate donors include matched 
unrelated, UCB, or mismatched family-related donors. These patients are at risk 
for infections that include CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), EBV-related 
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease, community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRV), 
and infections with encapsulated bacteria (e.g., 
<I>Ha. influenzae</I> and <I>Stre. 
pneumoniae</I>). Risk for these infections is approximately proportional to the severity of 
the patient's GVHD during phases II and III. Patients receiving mismatched 
allogeneic transplants have a higher attack rate and severity of GVHD and, therefore, 
a higher risk for OIs during phases II and III than do patients receiving 
matched allogeneic HSCTs. In contrast, patients undergoing autologous 
transplantation are primarily at risk for infection during phase I.
</UL>
<P>Preventing infections among HSCT recipients is preferable to treating infections. 
How

ever, despite recent technologic advances, more research is needed to optimize 
health outcomes for HSCT recipients. Efforts to improve immune system reconstitution, 
particularly among allogeneic transplant recipients, and to prevent or resolve the 
immune dysregulation resulting from donor-recipient histoincompatibility and GVHD remain 
substantial challenges for preventing recurrent, persistent, or progressive infections 
among HSCT patients.

<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Because bacteria are carried on the hands, health-care workers (HCWs) and others 
in contact with HSCT recipients should routinely follow appropriate hand-washing 
practices to avoid exposing recipients to bacterial pathogens (AIII).

<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P><B><I>Preventing Early Disease (0--100 Days After 
HSCT).</I></B> Routine gut decontamination is not recommended for HSCT candidates (51--53) (DIII). Because of limited data, 
no recommendations can be made regarding the routine use of antibiotics for 
bacterial prophylaxis among afebrile, asymptomatic neutropenic recipients. Although studies 
have reported that using prophylactic antibiotics might reduce bacteremia rates after 
HSCT (51), infection-related fatality rates are not reduced (52). If physicians choose to 
use prophylactic antibiotics among asymptomatic, afebrile, neutropenic recipients, 
they should routinely review hospital and HSCT center antibiotic-susceptibility profiles, 
particularly when using a single antibiotic for antibacterial prophylaxis (BIII). The 
emergence of fluoquinolone-resistant coagulase-negative 
<I>Staphylococci</I> and <I>Es. coli</I> (51,52), 
vancomycin-intermediate <I>Sta. aureus</I> and vancomycin-resistant 
<I>Enterococcus</I> (VRE) are increasing concerns (54). Vancomycin should not be used as an agent for routine 
bacterial prophylaxis (DIII). Growth factors (e.g., GM-CSF and G-CSF) shorten the duration 
of neutropenia after HSCT (55); however, no data were found that indicate whether 
growth factors effectively reduce the attack rate of invasive bacterial disease.
</P><P>Physicians should not routinely administer IVIG products to HSCT recipients for 
bacterial infection prophylaxis (DII), although IVIG has been recommended for use in 
producing immune system modulation for GVHD prevention. Researchers have 
recommended routine IVIG*** use to prevent bacterial infections among the approximately 
20%--25% of HSCT recipients with unrelated marrow grafts who experience severe 
hypogamma-globulinemia (e.g., IgG &lt; 400 mg/dl) within the first 100 days after transplant (CIII). 
For example, recipients who are hypogammaglobulinemic might receive prophylactic 
IVIG to prevent bacterial sinopulmonary infections (e.g., from 
<I>Stre. pneumoniae</I>) (<I>8</I>) (CIII). For hypogammaglobulinemic allogeneic recipients, physicians can use a higher and 
more frequent dose of IVIG than is standard for non-HSCT recipients because the IVIG 
half-life among HSCT recipients (generally 1--10 days) is much shorter than the half-life 
among healthy adults (generally 18--23 days) 
(<I>56--58</I>). Additionally, infections might 
accelerate IgG catabolism; therefore, the IVIG dose for a hypogammaglobulinemic recipient 
should 

be individualized to maintain trough serum IgG concentrations &gt;400--500 mg/dl 
(<I>58</I>) (BII). Consequently, physicians should monitor trough serum IgG concentrations among 
these patients approximately every 2 weeks and adjust IVIG doses as needed (BIII)
(<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).

for as long as active chronic GVHD treatment is administered 
(<I>59</I>) (BIII). Antibiotic selection should be guided by local antibiotic resistance patterns. In the absence of severe 
demonstrable hypogammaglobulinemia (e.g., IgG levels &lt; 400 mg/dl, which might be 
associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections), routine monthly IVIG administration to

</P><P>Information regarding the currently available 23-valent pneumococcal

because of its potential benefit to certain patients, it should be administered to HSCT 
recipients at 12 and 24 months after HSCT 
(<I>64--66</I>) (BIII). No data were found regarding 
safety and immunogenicity of the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine among HSCT 
recipients; therefore, no recommendation regarding use of this vaccine can be made.
</P><P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for preventing infection with 
encapsulated organisms (e.g., <I>Stre.

administered (<I>59</I>) (BIII). Trimethoprim-sulfamethasaxole (TMP-SMZ) administered 
for <I>Pneumocystis carinii</I> pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis will also provide protection 
against pneumococcal infections. However, no data were found to support using TMP-SMZ 
prophylaxis among HSCT recipients solely for the purpose of preventing 
<I>Stre. pneumoniae</I> disease. Certain strains of 
<I>Stre. pneumoniae</I> are resistant to TMP-SMZ and 
penicillin. Recommendations for preventing pneumococcal infections are the same for 
allogeneic or autologous recipients.
</P><P>As with adults, pediatric HSCT recipients aged 
<U>&gt;</U>2 years should be administered the current 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine because the vaccine can 
be effective (BIII). However, this vaccine should not be administered to children aged 
&lt;2 years because it is not effective among that age population (DI). No data were 
found regarding safety and immunogenicity of the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal

this vaccine can be made.
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding <I>Streptococci viridans</I></B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Because <I>Streptococci viridans</I> colonize the oropharynx and gut, no effective 
method of preventing exposure is known.
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>Chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis is a potential source of 
<I>Streptococci viridans</I> bacteremia. Consequently, before conditioning starts, dental consults should be 
obtained for all HSCT candidates to assess their state of oral health and to perform any 
needed dental procedures to decrease the risk for oral infections after transplant 
(<I>67</I>) (AIII).
</P><P>Generally, HSCT physicians should not use prophylactic antibiotics to prevent 
<I>Streptococci viridans</I> infections (DIII). No data were found that demonstrate efficacy of 
prophylactic antibiotics for this infection. Furthermore, such use might select 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and in fact, penicillin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of 
<I>Streptococci viridans</I> have been reported 
(<I>68</I>). However, when <I>Streptococci 
viridans</I> infections among HSCT recipients are virulent and associated with overwhelming sepsis and 
shock in an institution, prophylaxis might be evaluated (CIII). Decisions regarding the use 
of <I>Streptococci viridans</I> prophylaxis should be made only after consultation with the 
hospital epidemiologists or infection-control practitioners who monitor rates of 
nosocomial bacteremia and bacterial susceptibility (BIII).
</P><P>HSCT physicians should be familiar with current antibiotic susceptibilities for 
patient isolates from their HSCT centers, including 
<I>Streptococci viridans</I> (BIII). Physicians 
should maintain a high index of suspicion for this infection among HSCT recipients with 
symptomatic mucositis because early diagnosis and aggressive therapy are currently the 
only potential means of preventing shock when severely neutropenic HSCT recipients 
experience <I>Streptococci viridans</I> bacteremia 
(<I>69</I>).
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding <I>Ha. influenzae</I> type b</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Adults with <I>Ha. influenzae</I> type b (Hib) pneumonia require standard precautions 
(<I>62</I>) to prevent exposing the HSCT recipient to Hib. Adults and children who are in 
contact with the HSCT recipient and who have known or suspected invasive Hib disease, 
including meningitis, bacteremia, or epiglottitis, should be placed in droplet precautions until 
24 hours after they begin appropriate antibiotic therapy, after which they can be switched 
to standard precautions. Household contacts exposed to persons with Hib disease and 
who also have contact with HSCT recipients should be administered rifampin 
prophylaxis according to published recommendations 
(<I>70,71</I>); prophylaxis for household contacts 
of a patient with Hib disease are necessary if all contacts aged &lt;4 years are not 
fully vaccinated (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). This recommendation is critical because the risk for 
invasive Hib disease among unvaccinated household contacts aged &lt;4 years is 
increased, and rifampin can be effective in eliminating Hib carriage and preventing invasive 
Hib disease (<I>72--74</I>). Pediatric household contacts should be up-to-date with Hib 
vaccinations to prevent possible Hib exposure to the HSCT recipient (AII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>Although no data regarding vaccine efficacy among HSCT recipients were found, 
Hib conjugate vaccine should be administered to HSCT recipients at 12, 14, and 24 
months after HSCT (BII). This vaccine is recommended because the majority of HSCT 
recipients have low levels of Hib capsular polysaccharide antibodies 
<U>&gt;</U>4 months after HSCT (<I>75</I>), and allogeneic recipients with chronic GVHD are at increased risk for infection 
from encapsulated organisms (e.g., Hib) 
(<I>76,77</I>). HSCT recipients who are exposed to 
persons with Hib disease should be offered rifampin prophylaxis according to published 
recommendations (<I>70</I>) (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><P>Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for preventing infection with 
encapsulated organisms (e.g., <I>Stre.

meningitidis</I>) among allogeneic recipients with chronic GVHD for as long as active chronic GVHD treatment is 
administered (<I>59</I>) (BIII). Antibiotic selection should be guided by local antibiotic-resistance 
patterns. Recommendations for preventing Hib infections are the same for allogeneic 
or autologous recipients. Recommendations for preventing Hib disease are the same 
for pediatric or adult HSCT recipients, except that any child infected with Hib 
pneumonia requires standard precautions with droplet precautions added for the first 24 hours 
after beginning appropriate antibiotic therapy 
(<I>62,70</I>) (BIII). Appropriate pediatric doses 
should be administered for Hib conjugate vaccine and for rifampin prophylaxis 
(<I>71</I>) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).

<h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding Cytomegalovirus</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates should be tested for the presence of serum anti-CMV IgG 
antibodies before transplantation to determine their risk for primary CMV infection and 
reactivation after HSCT (AIII). Only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed or approved 
tests should be used. HSCT recipients and candidates should avoid sharing cups, glasses, 
and eating utensils with others, including family members, to decrease the risk for 
CMV exposure (BIII).
</P><P>Sexually active patients who are not in long-term monogamous relationships 
should always use latex condoms during sexual contact to reduce their risk for exposure to 
CMV and other sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). However, even long-time 
monogamous pairs can be discordant for CMV infections. Therefore, during periods of 
immuno-compromise, sexually active HSCT recipients in monogamous relationships should ask 
partners to be tested for serum CMV IgG antibody, and discordant couples should use 
latex condoms during sexual contact to reduce the risk for exposure to this sexually 
transmitted OI (CIII).
</P><P>After handling or changing diapers or after wiping oral and nasal secretions, 
HSCT candidates and recipients should practice regular hand washing to reduce the risk 
for CMV exposure (AII). CMV-seronegative recipients of allogeneic stem cell 
transplants from CMV-seronegative donors (i.e., R-negative or D-negative) should receive only 
leukocyte-reduced or CMV-seronegative red cells or leukocyte-reduced platelets (&lt;1 x 
10<SUP>6</SUP> leukocytes/unit) to prevent transfusion-associated CMV infection 
(<I>78</I>) (AI). However, insufficient data were found to recommend use of leukocyte-reduced or 
CMV-seronega

tive red cells and platelets among CMV-seronegative recipients who have 
CMV-seropositive donors (i.e., R-negative or D-positive).
</P><P>All HCWs should wear gloves when handling blood products or other 
potentially contaminated biologic materials (AII) to prevent transmission of CMV to HSCT 
recipients. HSCT patients who are known to excrete CMV should be placed under standard 
precautions (<I>62</I>) for the duration of CMV excretion to avoid possible transmission to 
CMV-seronegative HSCT recipients and candidates (AIII). Physicians are cautioned that 
CMV excretion can be episodic or prolonged.
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease and Disease Recurrence</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT recipients at risk for CMV disease after HSCT (i.e., all CMV-seropositive 
HSCT recipients, and all CMV-seronegative recipients with a CMV-seropositive donor) 
should be placed on a CMV disease prevention program from the time of engraftment until 
100 days after HSCT (i.e., phase II) (AI). Physicians should use either prophylaxis or 
preemptive treatment with ganciclovir for allogeneic recipients (AI). In selecting a CMV 
disease prevention strategy, physicians should assess the risks and benefits of each strategy, 
the needs and condition of the patient, and the hospital's virology laboratory support 
capability.
</P><P>Prophylaxis strategy against early CMV (i.e., &lt;100 days after HSCT) for 
allogeneic recipients involves administering ganciclovir prophylaxis to all allogeneic recipients 
at risk throughout phase II (i.e., from engraftment to 100 days after HSCT). The 
induction course is usually started at engraftment (AI), although physicians can add a brief 
prophylactic course during HSCT preconditioning (CIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><P>Preemptive strategy against early CMV (i.e., &lt;100 days after HSCT) for 
allogeneic recipients is preferred over prophylaxis for CMV-seronegative HSCT recipients of 
seropositive donor cells (i.e., D-positive or R-negative) because of the low attack rate of 
active CMV infection if screened or filtered blood product support is used (BII). 
Preemptive strategy restricts ganciclovir use for those patients who have evidence of CMV 
infection after HSCT. It requires the use of sensitive and specific laboratory tests to rapidly 
diagnose CMV infection after HSCT and to enable immediate administration of 
ganciclovir after CMV infection has been detected. Allogeneic recipients at risk should be 
screened <U>&gt;</U>1 times/week from 10 days to 100 days after HSCT (i.e., phase II) for the presence 
of CMV viremia or antigenemia (AIII).
</P><P>HSCT physicians should select one of two diagnostic tests to determine the need 
for preemptive treatment. Currently, the detection of CMV pp65 antigen in 
leukocytes (antigenemia) (<I>79,80</I>) is preferred for screening for preemptive treatment because it 
is more rapid and sensitive than culture and has good positive predictive value 
(<I>79--81</I>). Direct detection of CMV-DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) (<I>82</I>) is very sensitive but has a low positive predictive value 
(<I>79</I>). Although CMV-DNA PCR is less sensitive than whole blood or leukocyte PCR, plasma CMV-DNA PCR is 
useful during neutropenia, when the number of leukocytes/slide is too low to allow CMV 
pp65 antigenemia testing.
</P><P>Virus culture of urine, saliva, blood, or bronchoalveolar washings by rapid 
shell-vial culture (<I>83</I>) or routine culture 
(<I>84,85</I>) can be used; however, viral culture techniques 
are less sensitive than CMV-DNA PCR or CMV pp65 antigenemia tests. Also, rapid 
shell-viral cultures require <U>&gt;</U>48 hours and routine viral cultures can require weeks to obtain 
final results. Thus, viral culture techniques are less satisfactory than PCR or 
antigenemia 

tests. HSCT centers without access to PCR or antigenemia tests should use 
prophylaxis rather than preemptive therapy for CMV disease prevention 
(<I>86</I>) (BII). Physicians do use other diagnostic tests (e.g., hybrid capture CMV-DNA assay, Version 2.0 
[<I>87</I>] or CMV pp67 viral RNA [ribonucleic acid] detection) 
(<I>88</I>); however, limited data were found regarding use among HSCT recipients, and therefore, no recommendation for use can 
be made.
</P><P>Allogeneic recipients <U>&lt;</U>100 days after HSCT (i.e., during phase II) should begin 
preemptive treatment with ganciclovir if CMV viremia or any antigenemia is detected or 
if the recipient has <U>&gt;</U>2 consecutively positive CMV-DNA PCR tests (BIII). After 
preemptive treatment has been started, maintenance ganciclovir is usually continued until 100 
days after HSCT or for a minimum of 3 weeks, whichever is longer (AI) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Antigen 
or PCR tests should be negative when ganciclovir is stopped. Studies report that a 
shorter course of ganciclovir (e.g., for 3 weeks or until negative PCR or antigenemia occurs) 
(<I>89--91</I>) might provide adequate CMV prevention with less toxicity, but routine weekly 
screening by pp65 antigen or PCR test is necessary after stopping ganciclovir because 
CMV reactivation can occur (BIII).
</P><P>Presently, only the intravenous formulation of ganciclovir has been approved for 
use in CMV prophylactic or preemptive strategies (BIII). No recommendation for 
oral ganciclovir use among HSCT recipients can be made because clinical trials evaluating 
its efficacy are still in progress. One group has used ganciclovir and foscarnet on 
alternate days for CMV prevention (<I>92</I>), but no recommendation can be made regarding 
this strategy because of limited data. Patients who are ganciclovir-intolerant should be 
administered foscarnet instead (<I>93</I>) (BII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). HSCT recipients receiving 
ganciclovir should have ANCs checked <U>&gt;</U>2 times/week (BIII). Researchers report 
managing ganciclovir-associated neutropenia by adding G-CSF 
(<I>94</I>) or temporarily stopping ganciclovir for 
<U>&gt;</U>2 days if the patient's ANC is &lt;1,000 (CIII). Ganciclovir can be 
restarted when the patient's ANC is <U>&gt;</U>1,000 for 2 consecutive days. Alternatively, 
researchers report substituting foscarnet for ganciclovir if a) the HSCT recipient is still CMV viremic 
or antigenemic or b) the ANC remains &lt;1,000 for &gt;5 days after ganciclovir has been 
stopped (CIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Because neutropenia accompanying ganciclovir administration is 
usually brief, such patients do not require antifungal or antibacterial prophylaxis (DIII).
</P><P>Currently, no benefit has been reported from routinely administering ganciclovir 
prophylaxis to all HSCT recipients at &gt;100 days after HSCT (i.e., during phase III). 
However, persons with high risk for late CMV disease should be routinely screened biweekly 
for evidence of CMV reactivation as long as substantial immunocompromise persists 
(BIII). Risk factors for late CMV disease include allogeneic HSCT accompanied by chronic 
GVHD, steroid use, low CD4 counts, delay in high avidity anti-CMV antibody, and recipients 
of matched unrelated or T-cell--depleted HSCTs who are at high risk 
(<I>95--99</I>). If CMV is still detectable by routine screening 
<U>&gt;</U>100 days after HSCT, ganciclovir should be 
continued until CMV is no longer detectable (AI). If low-grade CMV antigenemia (&lt;5 positive 
cells/slide) is detected on routine screening, the antigenemia test should be repeated in 3 
days (BIII). If CMV antigenemia indicates 
<U>&gt;</U>5 cells/slide, PCR is positive, or the shell-vial 
culture detects CMV viremia, a 3-week course of preemptive ganciclovir treatment should 
be administered (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Ganciclovir should also be started if the patient has 
had <U>&gt;</U>2 consecutively positive viremia or PCR tests (e.g., in a person receiving steroids 
for GVHD or who received ganciclovir or foscarnet at &lt;100 days after HSCT). Current 
investigational strategies for preventing late CMV disease include the use of targeted 
prophylaxis with antiviral drugs and cellular immunotherapy for those with deficient or 
absent 

CMV-specific immune system function.
</P><P>If viremia persists after 4 weeks of ganciclovir preemptive therapy or if the level 
of antigenemia continues to rise after 3 weeks of therapy, ganciclovir-resistant CMV 
should be suspected. If CMV viremia recurs during continuous treatment with ganciclovir, 
researchers report restarting ganciclovir induction 
(<I>100</I>) or stopping ganciclovir and starting foscarnet (CIII). Limited data were found regarding the use of foscarnet among 
HSCT recipients for either CMV prophylaxis or preemptive therapy 
(<I>92,93</I>).
</P><P>Infusion of donor-derived CMV-specific clones of CD8+ T-cells into the transplant 
recipient is being evaluated under FDA Investigational New Drug authorization; 
therefore, no recommendation can be made. Although, in a substantial cooperative study, 
high-dose acyclovir has had certain efficacy for preventing CMV disease 
(<I>101</I>), its utility is limited in a setting where more potent anti-CMV agents (e.g., ganciclovir) are used 
(<I>102</I>). Acyclovir is not effective in preventing CMV disease after autologous HSCT 
(<I>103</I>) and is, therefore, not recommended for CMV preemptive therapy (DII). 
Consequently, valacyclovir, although under study for use among HSCT recipients, is presumed to 
be less effective than ganciclovir against CMV and is currently not recommended for 
CMV disease prevention (DII).
</P><P>Although HSCT physicians continue to use IVIG for immune system modulation, 
IVIG is not recommended for CMV disease prophylaxis among HSCT recipients (DI). 
Cidofovir, a nucleoside analog, is approved by FDA for the treatment of AIDS-associated 
CMV retinitis. The drug's major disadvantage is nephrotoxicity. Cidofovir is currently in 
FDA phase 1 trial for use among HSCT recipients; therefore, recommendations for its 
use cannot be made.
</P><P>Use of CMV-negative or leukocyte-reduced blood products is not routinely 
required for all autologous recipients because most have a substantially lower risk for CMV 
disease. However, CMV-negative or leukocyte-reduced blood products can be used 
for CMV-seronegative autologous recipients (CIII). Researchers report that 
CMV-seropositive autologous recipients be evaluated for preemptive therapy if they have 
underlying hematologic malignancies (e.g., lymphoma or leukemia), are receiving intense 
conditioning regimens or graft manipulation, or have recently received fludarabine or 
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (CDA) (CIII). This subpopulation of autologous recipients 
should be monitored weekly from time of engraftment until 60 days after HSCT for CMV 
reactivation, preferably with quantitative CMV pp65 antigen 
(<I>80</I>) or quantitative PCR (BII).
</P><P>Autologous recipients at high risk who experience CMV antigenemia (i.e., blood 
levels of <U>&gt;</U>5 positive cells/slide) should receive 3 weeks of preemptive treatment with 
ganciclovir or foscarnet (<I>80</I>), but CD34+-selected patients should be treated at any level 
of antigenemia (BII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Prophylactic approach to CMV disease prevention is 
not appropriate for CMV-seropositive autologous recipients. Indications for the use of 
CMV prophylaxis or preemptive treatment are the same for children or adults.

<B>Recommendations Regarding EBV</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>All transplant candidates, particularly those who are EBV-seronegative, should 
be advised of behaviors that could decrease the likelihood of EBV exposure (AII). For 
example, HSCT recipients and candidates should follow safe hygiene practices (e.g., 
frequent hand washing [AIII] and avoiding the sharing of cups, glasses, and eating 
utensils 

with others) (<I>104</I>) (BIII), and they should avoid contact with potentially infected 
respiratory secretions and saliva (<I>104</I>) (AII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>Infusion of donor-derived, EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes has 
demonstrated promise in the prophylaxis of EBV-lymphoma among recipients of T-cell--depleted 
unrelated or mismatched allogeneic recipients 
(<I>105,106</I>). However, insufficient data were found to recommend its use. Prophylaxis or preemptive therapy with acyclovir is 
not recommended because of lack of efficacy 
(<I>107,108</I>) (DII).
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding HSV</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates should be tested for serum anti-HSV IgG before transplant 
(AIII); however, type-specific anti-HSV IgG serology testing is not necessary. Only 
FDA-licensed or -approved tests should be used. All HSCT candidates, particularly those who are 
HSV-seronegative, should be informed of the importance of avoiding HSV infection 
while immunocompromised and should be advised of behaviors that will decrease the 
likelihood of HSV exposure (AII). HSCT recipients and candidates should avoid sharing 
cups, glasses, and eating utensils with others (BIII). Sexually active patients who are not in 
a long-term monogamous relationship should always use latex condoms during 
sexual contact to reduce the risk for exposure to HSV as well as other sexually 
transmitted pathogens (AII). However, even long-time monogamous pairs can be discordant for 
HSV infections. Therefore, during periods of immunocompromise, sexually active HSCT 
recipients in such relationships should ask partners to be tested for serum HSV IgG 
antibody. If the partners are discordant, they should consider using latex condoms 
during sexual contact to reduce the risk for exposure to this sexually transmitted OI (CIII). 
Any person with disseminated, primary, or severe mucocutaneous HSV disease should 
be placed under contact precautions for the duration of the illness 
(<I>62</I>) (AI) to prevent transmission of HSV to HSCT recipients.
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease and Disease Recurrence</I></B>
</P><P><B><I>Acyclovir</I></B>. Acyclovir prophylaxis should be offered to all HSV-seropositive 
allogeneic recipients to prevent HSV reactivation during the early posttransplant period 
(<I>109--113</I>) (AI). Standard approach is to begin acyclovir prophylaxis at the start of the 
conditioning therapy and continue until engraftment occurs or until mucositis resolves, whichever 
is longer, or approximately 30 days after HSCT (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Without supportive 
data from controlled studies, routine use of antiviral prophylaxis for &gt;30 days after HSCT 
to prevent HSV is not recommended (DIII). Routine acyclovir prophylaxis is not indicated 
for HSV-seronegative HSCT recipients, even if the donors are HSV-seropositive (DIII). 
Researchers have proposed administration of ganciclovir prophylaxis alone 
(<I>86</I>) to HSCT recipients who required simultaneous prophylaxis for CMV and HSV after HSCT 
(CIII) because ganciclovir has in vitro activity against CMV and HSV 1 and 2 
(<I>114</I>), although ganciclovir has not been approved for use against HSV.
</P><P><B><I>Valacyclovir</I></B>. Researchers have reported valacyclovir use for preventing HSV 
among 

HSCT recipients (CIII); however, preliminary data demonstrate that very high doses 
of valacyclovir (8 g/day) were associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic 
purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome among HSCT recipients 
(<I>115</I>). Controlled trial data among HSCT recipients are limited 
(<I>115</I>), and the FDA has not approved valacyclovir for 
use among recipients. Physicians wishing to use valacyclovir among recipients with 
renal impairment should exercise caution and decrease doses as needed (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).

is not recommended for routine HSV prophylaxis among HSCT recipients (DIII).

HSCT recipients are limited; therefore, no recommendations for HSV prophylaxis 
with famciclovir can be made.

</P><P>HSV prophylaxis lasting &gt;30 days after HSCT might be considered for persons

administration to HSV-seropositive autologous recipients who are likely to experience 
substantial mucositis from the conditioning regimen (CIII). Antiviral prophylaxis doses should 
be modified for use among children (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>), but no published data were found 
regarding valacyclovir safety and efficacy among children.
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding VZV</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates should be tested for the presence of serum anti-VZV IgG 
antibodies (AIII). However, these tests are not 100% reliable, particularly among severely 
immunosuppressed patients. Researchers recommend that a past history of varicella 
accompanied by a positive titer is more likely to indicate the presence of immunity to VZV than 
a low positive titer alone. All HSCT candidates and recipients, particularly those who 
are VZV-seronegative, should be informed of the potential seriousness of VZV disease 
among immunocompromised persons and advised of strategies to decrease their risk for 
VZV exposure (<I>116--122</I>) (AII).
</P><P>Although researchers report that the majority of VZV disease after HSCT is caused 
by reactivation of endogenous VZV, HSCT candidates and recipients who are 
VZV-seronegative, or VZV-seropositive and immunocompromised, should avoid exposure to 
persons with active VZV infections (<I>123</I>) (AII). HCWs, family members, household 
contacts, and visitors who are healthy and do not have a reported history of varicella infection 
or who are VZV-seronegative should receive VZV vaccination before being allowed to 
visit or have direct contact with an HSCT recipient (AIII). Ideally, VZV-susceptible family 
members, household contacts, and potential visitors of immunocompromised HSCT 
recipients should be vaccinated as soon as the decision is made to perform HSCT. The 
vaccination dose or doses should be completed 
<U>&gt;</U>4 weeks before the conditioning regimen begins 
or <U>&gt;</U>6 weeks (42 days) before the HSCT is performed (BIII).
</P><P>HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy should avoid 
contact with any VZV vaccine recipient who experiences a rash after vaccination (BIII). 
When this rash occurs, it usually appears 14--21 days after VZV vaccination (median: 22 
days; 

range: 5--35 days) (personal communication from Robert G. Sharrar, M.D., Merck &amp; 
Co., Inc.). However, to date, no serious disease has been reported among 
immuno-compromised patients from transmission of VZV vaccine virus, and the VZV 
vaccine strain is susceptible to acyclovir.
</P><P>All HSCT recipients with VZV disease should be placed under airborne and 
contact precautions (<I>62</I>) (AII) to prevent transmission to other HSCT recipients. Contact 
precautions should be continued until all skin lesions are crusted. Airborne precautions 
should be instituted 10 days after exposure to VZV and continued until 21 days after last 
exposure or 28 days postexposure if the patient received varicella-zoster 
immunoglobulin (VZIG)**** (<I>62</I>) (AI) because a person infected with VZV can be infectious before 
the rash appears.
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P><B><I>VZIG</I></B>. VZV-seronegative HSCT recipients should be administered VZIG as soon 
as possible but ideally within 96 hours after close or household contact with a person 
having either chickenpox or shingles if the HSCT recipient is not immunocompetent (i.e., 
allogeneic patient &lt;24 months after HSCT, 
<U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT and on 
immunosuppressive therapy, or having chronic GVHD) (AII). Researchers report VZIG administration for 
VZV exposure as described for HSCT recipients who were VZV-seropositive before 
HSCT (CIII).
</P><P>Because of the high morbidity of VZV-associated disease among 
severely immunocompromised HSCT recipients and until further data are published, HSCT 
physicians should administer VZIG to all VZV-seronegative HSCT recipients or 
candidates undergoing conditioning therapy who are exposed to a VZV vaccinee having a 
varicella-like rash (BIII). Researchers also report VZIG administration for this situation for 
VZV-seropositive HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (CIII). 
These recommendations are made because the vaccinee might be unknowingly 
incubating wild-type varicella, particularly during the first 14 days after varicella vaccination, 
and because vaccine-strain VZV has been rarely transmitted by VZV vaccinees with 
vesicular rashes postvaccination (<I>121</I>).
</P><P>If VZV-seronegative HSCT recipients or candidates undergoing conditioning 
therapy are closely exposed to varicella &gt;3 weeks after receiving VZIG, they should be 
administered another dose of VZIG (<I>120</I>) (BIII). Researchers also recommend VZIG 
administration for this condition for VZV-seropositive HSCT recipients and candidates 
undergoing conditioning therapy (CIII).
</P><P><B><I>Antiviral Drugs</I></B>. Any HSCT recipient or candidate undergoing conditioning 
therapy who experiences a VZV-like rash (particularly after exposure to a person with 
wild-type varicella or shingles) should receive preemptive intravenous acyclovir until 
<U>&gt;</U>2 days after all lesions have crusted (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Any HSCT recipient or candidate 
undergoing conditioning therapy who experiences a VZV-like rash after exposure to a VZV 
vaccinee with a rash should be administered intravenous acyclovir preemptively to prevent 
severe, disseminated VZV disease (BII). Acyclovir should be administered until 2 days 
after 

all lesions have crusted.
</P><P>Long-term acyclovir prophylaxis to prevent recurrent VZV infection (e.g., during 
the first 6 months after HSCT) is not routinely recommended 
(<I>124--126</I>) (DIII); however, this therapy could be considered for use among HSCT recipients with severe, 
long-term immunodeficiency (CIII). When acyclovir resistance occurs among patients, HSCT 
physicians should use foscarnet for preemptive treatment of VZV disease 
(<I>127</I>) (BIII). Researchers report valacyclovir use for preventing HSV among HSCT recipients 
(CIII). However, preliminary data demonstrate that very high doses of valacyclovir (8 
g/day) were associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic 
syndrome among HSCT recipients (<I>115</I>). Controlled trial data regarding HSCT recipients are 
limited (<I>115</I>), and the FDA has not approved valacyclovir for use among HSCT recipients. 
Physicians wishing to use valacyclovir among HSCT recipients with renal impairment 
should exercise caution and decrease doses as needed (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). No data were 
found demonstrating safety and efficacy of preemptive treatment of famciclovir against 
herpes zoster among HSCT recipients. Consequently, no recommendation for its use can 
be made.
</P><P><B><I>Live-Attenuated VZV Vaccine</I></B>. VZV vaccine use is contraindicated among HSCT 
recipients &lt;24 months after HSCT (<I>128</I>) (EIII). Use of VZV vaccine among HSCT recipients 
is restricted to research protocols for recipients 
<U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT who are presumed immunocompetent. Further research is needed to determine the safety, 
immunogenicity, and efficacy of VZV vaccine among HSCT recipients.
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>An inactivated VZV vaccine has been used investigationally among HSCT 
recipients (<I>129</I>); however, more studies are needed before a recommendation regarding its 
use can be made. Recommendations for VZV prevention are the same for allogeneic 
or autologous recipients. Recommendations for preventing VZV disease among 
pediatric or adult HSCT recipients are the same, except that appropriate dose adjustments 
for VZIG should be made for pediatric HSCT recipients (AIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).

<B>Recommendations Regarding CRV Infections: 
Influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, 
Parainfluenza Virus, and Adenovirus</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Preventing CRV exposure is critical in preventing CRV disease 
(<I>130,131</I>). To prevent nosocomial CRV transmission, HSCT recipients and their HCWs should always 
follow HSCT infection control guidelines (AIII). To minimize the risk for CRV transmission, 
HCWs and visitors with upper respiratory infection (URI) symptoms should be restricted 
from contact with HSCT recipients and HSCT candidates undergoing conditioning 
therapy (AIII). At a minimum, active clinical surveillance for CRV disease should be conducted 
on all hospitalized HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy; 
this clinical surveillance should include daily screening for signs and symptoms of CRV 
(e.g., URI or lower respiratory infection [LRI]) (AIII). Viral cultures of asymptomatic HSCT 
candidates are unlikely to be useful. HSCT recipients with URI or LRI symptoms should 
be placed under contact precautions to avoid transmitting infection to other HSCT 
candi

dates and recipients, HCWs, and visitors until the etiology of illness is identified 
(<I>62</I>) (BIII). Optimal isolation precautions should be modified as needed after the etiology is 
identified (AIII). HSCT recipients and candidates, their family members and visitors, and 
all HCWs should be informed regarding CRV infection control measures and the 
potential severity of CRV infections among HSCT recipients 
(<I>130--140</I>) (BIII). Physicians have routinely conducted culture-based CRV surveillance among HSCT recipients; 
however, the cost effectiveness of this approach has not been evaluated.
</P><P>Influenza vaccination of family members and close or household contacts is 
strongly recommended during each influenza season (i.e., October--May) starting the 
season before HSCT and continuing <U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT 
(<I>141</I>) (AI) to prevent influenza exposure among the recipients or candidates. All family members and close or 
household contacts of HSCT recipients who remain immunocompromised 
<U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT should continue to be vaccinated annually as long as the HSCT recipient's 
immuno-compromise persists (<I>141</I>) (AI). Seasonal influenza vaccination is strongly 
recommended for all HCWs of HSCT recipients 
(<I>142,143</I>) (AI).
</P><P>If HCWs, family members, or other close contacts of HSCT recipients receive 
influenza vaccination during an influenza A outbreak, they should receive amantadine 
or rimantadine chemoprophylaxis for 2 weeks after influenza vaccination (BI) while 
the vaccinee experiences an immunologic response to the vaccine. Such a strategy is 
likely to prevent transmission of influenza A to HCWs and other close contacts of HSCT 
recipients, which could prevent influenza A transmission to HSCT recipients themselves. 
However, if a nosocomial outbreak occurs with an influenza A strain that is not contained in 
the available influenza vaccine, all healthy family members, close and household 
contacts, and HCWs of HSCT recipients and candidates should be administered influenza A 
chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine until the end of the outbreak 
(<I>141</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>In 1999, two neuroaminidase inhibitors (zanamivir and oseltamivir) were 
approved for treatment of influenza, but are not currently approved for prophylaxis. To date, 
experience is limited regarding use of zanamivir or oseltamivir in the treatment or 
prophylaxis of influenza among HSCT settings. However, HCWs, family members, or other 
close contacts can be offered a neuroaminidase inhibitor (e.g., zanamivir or oseltamivir) 
using the same strategies outlined previously, if a) rimantadine or amantadine cannot be 
tolerated, b) the outbreak strain of influenza A is amantadine or rimantadine-resistant, or 
c) the outbreak strain is influenza B 
(<I>144--147</I>) (BI). Zanamivir can be administered to 
persons aged <U>&gt;</U>12 years, and oseltamivir can be administered to persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>18 years. Patients with influenza should be placed under droplet and standard precautions (AIII) 
to prevent transmission of influenza to HSCT recipients. HCWs with influenza should 
be excused from patient care until they are no longer infectious (AIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT physicians should determine the etiology of a URI in an HSCT recipient 
or candidate undergoing conditioning therapy, if possible, because respiratory 
syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus URIs can progress to more 
serious LRI, and certain CRVs can be treated (BIII). Appropriate diagnostic samples include 
nasopharyngeal washes, swabs or aspirates, throat swabs, and bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) fluid. HSCT candidates with URI symptoms at the time conditioning therapy 
is scheduled to start should postpone their conditioning regimen until the URIs resolve, 
if possible, because certain URIs might progress to LRI during 
immunosuppression (<I>131,133,137,138</I>) (BIII).
</P><P><B><I>Recommendations Regarding 
Influenza.</I></B> Life-long seasonal influenza vaccination 
is recommended for all HSCT candidates and recipients, beginning during the 
influenza season before HSCT and resuming 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months after HSCT (<I>142</I>) (BIII). Influenza 
vaccinations administered to HSCT recipients &lt;6 months after HSCT are unlikely to be 
beneficial and are not recommended (<I>142</I>) (DII). HSCT recipients &lt;6 months after HSCT 
should receive chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine during community or 
nosocomial influenza A outbreaks (BIII). These drugs are not effective against influenza 
B. Additionally, antiviral-resistant strains of influenza can emerge during treatment 
with amantadine or rimantadine and transmission of resistant strains can occur 
(<I>148,149</I>). During such outbreaks, HSCT recipients 6--24 months after HSCT, or &gt;24 months 
after HSCT and still substantially immunocompromised (i.e., receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy, have had a relapse of their underlying disease, or have GVHD) and who 
have not yet received a current influenza vaccination, should be vaccinated against 
influenza immediately (BIII). Additionally, to allow sufficient time for the patient to experience 
an immunologic response to influenza vaccine, chemoprophylaxis with amantadine 
or rimantadine can be used for these HSCT recipients for 2 weeks after vaccination 
during a nosocomial or community influenza A outbreak (CIII). Influenza A 
chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine has been recommended for all influenza 
A-exposed HSCT recipients &lt;24 months after HSCT or 
<U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT and substantially immunocompromised regardless of vaccination history, because of their likely 
suboptimal immunologic response to influenza vaccine 
(<I>142,143</I>). However, no recommendation regarding such chemoprophylaxis can be made because of lack of data.
</P><P>To prevent severe disease, early preemptive therapy with amantadine or 
rimantadine has been reported for HSCT recipients with unexplained acute URI or LRI 
symptoms during a community or nosocomial outbreak of influenza A 
(<I>141</I>). However, the effectiveness in preventing influenza-related complications and the safety of this strategy 
have not been evaluated among HSCT recipients. Therefore, data are insufficient to make 
a recommendation.
</P><P>Neuroaminidase inhibitors (zanimivir and oseltamivir), intravenous and 
aerosol ribavirin, and combination drug therapy (e.g., rimantadine or amantadine with 
ribavirin or interferon) (<I>143,150--153</I>) have been proposed for investigational, preemptive 
treatment to prevent severe influenza disease among HSCT recipients. However, because 
of lack of data, no recommendation for use of these strategies among HSCT recipients 
can be made.
</P><P><B><I>Recommendations Regarding RSV.</I></B> Respiratory secretions of any hospitalized 
HSCT candidate or recipient who experiences signs or&#160;symptoms of CRV infection should 
be tested promptly by viral culture and rapid diagnostic tests for RSV (BIII). If two 
diagnostic samples taken <U>&gt;</U>2 days apart do not identify a respiratory pathogen despite 
persistence of respiratory symptoms, BAL and further testing are advised (BIII). This testing is 
critical because of the high morbidity and case fatality of RSV disease among HSCT 
recipients (<I>154,155</I>). HSCT recipients, particularly those who are preengraftment and at 
highest risk for severe RSV pneumonia, should have their illness diagnosed early (i.e., 
during RSV URI), and their illness should be treated aggressively to prevent fatal RSV 
disease (BIII).
</P><P>Although a definitive, uniformly effective preemptive therapy for RSV infection 
among 

HSCT recipients has not been identified, certain strategies have been proposed, 
including use of aerosolized ribavirin 
(<I>155,156</I>), RSV antibodies (i.e., passive immunization 
with high RSV-titered IVIG or RSV immunoglobulin) in combination with aerosolized 
ribavirin (<I>137,157</I>), and RSV monoclonal antibody 
(<I>158</I>). Clinical trials are currently underway 
to evaluate the efficacy of these strategies. No recommendation regarding the 
optimal method for RSV prevention and preemptive therapy can be made because of 
limited data. Further, current data do not support use of intravenous ribavirin for 
preemptive therapy for RSV pneumonia among HSCT recipients 
(<I>60</I>) (DIII), and no commercially licensed vaccines against RSV are currently available.
</P><P><B><I>Recommendations Regarding Parainfluenza Virus and 
Adenovirus.</I></B> Immuno-prophylaxis, chemoprophylaxis, and preemptive treatment for parainfluenza virus 
and adenovirus infections among HSCT recipients have been proposed 
(<I>159,160</I>). However, no recommendation can be made in these guidelines because of insufficient data. 
No commercially licensed vaccines against parainfluenza or adenovirus are currently 
available.
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Disease Prevention Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>The recommendations for preventing CRV infections and their recurrence are 
the same for allogeneic or autologous recipients. Generally, these recommendations 
apply to children or adults (<I>161--164</I>), but with appropriate adjustments in antiviral drug 
and influenza vaccine doses for children (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><P>For pediatric HSCT recipients and candidates aged &gt;6 months, annual seasonal 
influenza vaccination is recommended HSCT (BIII). Children aged &lt;9 years who are 
receiving influenza vaccination for the first time require two doses administered 
<U>&gt;</U>1 months apart (AI). Healthy children who receive influenza vaccination for the first time might not 
generate protective antibodies until 2 weeks after receipt of the second dose of 
influenza vaccine. Therefore, during an influenza A outbreak, pediatric recipients aged &lt;9 
years, <U>&gt;</U>6 months after HSCT, and receiving their first influenza vaccination, should be 
administered <U>&gt;</U>6 weeks of influenza A chemoprophylaxis after the first dose of influenza 
vaccine (<I>141</I>) (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Amantadine and rimantadine are not FDA-approved for 
children aged &lt;1 year (<I>141,161</I>) (DIII).
</P><P>To prevent RSV disease, researchers report substituting RSV-IVIG for IVIG during 
RSV season (i.e., November--April) for pediatric recipients (i.e., children aged &lt;18 years) 
who receive routine IVIG therapy (<I>164</I>) (i.e., those with hypogammaglobulinemia) (CIII)
(<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Other researchers report that pediatric recipients with RSV can be 
considered for preemptive therapy (e.g., during URI or early LRI) with aerosolized ribavirin 
(CIII), although this therapy remains controversial 
(<I>164</I>) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Droplet and contact precautions for the duration of illness are required for pediatric recipients for the duration 
of adenovirus (<I>62</I>) (AIII).

<B>FUNGAL INFECTIONS</B>
</H3>
<h4>
<B>General Recommendations</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure
</I></B>
</P><P>Limited data were found that demonstrate to what extent preventing fungal 
exposures is effective in preventing infection and disease. However, HSCT recipients 
and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy have been advised to avoid contact 
with certain areas and substances, including foods, that might increase a patient's risk 
for fungal exposures (CII). Specific precautions have included avoiding areas of high 
dust exposure (e.g., excavation sites, areas of building construction or renovation, 
chicken coops, and caves), occupations involving soil, and foods that contain molds (e.g., 
blue cheese).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>Growth factors (e.g., GM-CSF and G-CSF) shorten the duration of neutropenia 
after HSCT (<I>165</I>); however, no data were found that indicate which growth factors 
effectively reduce the attack rate of invasive fungal disease. Therefore, no recommendation for 
use of growth factors solely for prophylaxis against invasive fungal disease can be made.
</P><P>Topical antifungal drugs, which are applied to the skin or mucosa (e.g., nystatin 
or clotrimazole), might reduce fungal colonization in the area of application. However, 
these agents have not been proven to prevent generation of locally invasive or 
disseminated yeast infections (e.g., candidiasis) or mold infections (e.g., aspergillosis) and are 
not recommended for their prophylaxis (DII). Performing fungal surveillance cultures is 
not indicated for asymptomatic HSCT recipients 
(<I>166,167</I>) (DII), but cultures should be obtained from symptomatic HSCT recipients (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding Yeast Infections</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Invasive candidiasis is usually caused by dissemination of endogenous 
<I>Candida</I> species that have colonized a patient's gastrointestinal tract 
(<I>168</I>). Consequently, methods of preventing exogenous yeast exposure usually do not prevent invasive yeast 
infections after HSCT. However, because 
<I>Candida</I> species can be carried on the hands, HCWs 
and others in contact with HSCT recipients should follow appropriate hand-washing 
practices to safeguard patients from exposure (AIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>Allogeneic recipients should be administered fluconazole prophylaxis to prevent 
invasive disease with fluconazole-susceptible 
<I>Candida</I> species during neutropenia, particularly among centers where 
<I>Can. albicans</I> is the predominant cause of invasive 
fungal disease preengraftment (AI) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Because candidiasis occurs during phase I 
(<I>169</I>), fluconazole (400 mg/day by mouth or intravenously) should be administered 
(<I>169,170</I>) from the day of HSCT until engraftment (AII). However, fluconazole is not effective 
against certain <I>Candida</I> species, including 
<I>Can. krusei</I> (<I>171</I>) and <I>Can. 
glabrata</I> and is, therefore, not recommended for their prevention (DI). Further studies are needed to determine 
the optimal duration of fluconazole prophylaxis. Preliminary studies have reported that 
low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis (100--200 mg/day by mouth) among neutropenic 
patients has variable efficacy in preventing candidiasis 
(<I>172</I>). Therefore, this therapy is not 
recommended for HSCT recipients (DII). Oral, nonabsorbable antifungal drugs, 
including 

oral amphotericin B (500 mg suspension every 6 hours), nystatin, and clotrimazole 
troches, might reduce superficial colonization and control local mucosal candidiasis, 
but have not been demonstrated to reduce invasive candidiasis (CIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates with candidemia or invasive candidiasis can safely receive 
transplants (<I>173</I>) if a) their infection was diagnosed early and treated immediately and 
aggressively with amphotericin B or alternatively with appropriate doses of fluconazole 
if the organism is susceptible; and b) evidence of disease control is reported (e.g., by 
serial computed tomography scans) before the transplant (BIII). Such patients should 
continue receiving therapeutic doses of an appropriate antifungal drug throughout phase I 
(BII) and until a careful review of clinical, laboratory, and serial computed tomography 
scans verifies resolution of candidiasis (BII).
</P><P>Because autologous recipients generally have an overall lower risk for invasive 
fungal infection than allogeneic recipients, certain autologous recipients do not require 
routine antiyeast prophylaxis (DIII). However, researchers recommend 
administering antiyeast prophylaxis to a subpopulation of autologous recipients with underlying 
hematologic malignancies (e.g., lymphoma or leukemia) and who have or will have 
prolonged neutropenia and mucosal damage from intense conditioning regimens or graft 
manipulation, or have received fludarabine or 2-CDA recently (BIII). Recommendations 
regarding preventing invasive yeast infections among pediatric or adult HSCT recipients 
are the same, except that appropriate dose adjustments for prophylactic drugs should 
be made for pediatric recipients (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding Mold Infections</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>Nosocomial mold infections among HSCT recipients result primarily from 
respiratory exposure to and direct contact with fungal spores 
(<I>174</I>). Ongoing hospital construction and renovation have been associated with an increased risk for nosocomial mold 
infection, particularly aspergillosis, among severely immunocompromised patients 
(<I>175--177</I>). Therefore, whenever possible, HSCT recipients who remain 
immunocompromised should avoid hospital construction or renovation areas (AIII). When constructing 
new HSCT centers or renovating old ones, hospital planners should ensure that rooms 
for HSCT patients have an adequate capacity to minimize fungal spore counts through use of
<UL>
<LI> high-efficiency (&gt;90%) particulate air (HEPA) filtration 
(<I>140,178,179</I>) (BIII);
<LI> directed room airflow (i.e., positive air pressure in patient rooms in relation 
to corridor air pressure) so that air from patient rooms flows into the corridor 
(<I>180</I>) (BIII);
<LI> correctly sealed rooms, including correctly sealed windows and electrical 
outlets (<I>140</I>) (BIII);
<LI> high rates of room air exchange (i.e., &gt;12 air changes/hour) 
(<I>140,178</I>) (BIII); and
<LI> barriers between patient care and renovation or construction areas (e.g., 
sealed plastic) that prevent dust from entering patient care areas and that 
are 

<LI>impermeable to <I>Aspergillus</I> species 
(<I>175,179</I>) (BIII).
</UL>
Additionally, HSCT centers should be cleaned with care, particularly after 
hospital renovation or construction, to avoid exposing HSCT recipients and candidates to 
mold spores (<I>174,176</I>) (BIII).
<P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>No regimen has been reported to be clearly effective or superior in preventing 
aspergillosis, and therefore, no recommendation can be made. Further studies are 
needed to determine the optimal strategy for aspergillosis prevention. Moderate-dose (0.5 
mg/kg/day) amphotericin B (<I>181--184</I>), low-dose (0.1--0.25 mg/kg/day) amphotericin B 
(<I>185--187</I>), intranasal amphotericin B spray 
(<I>188</I>), lipid formulations of amphotericin B 
(<I>182,189</I>), and aerosolized amphotericin B 
(<I>190</I>) have been administered for aspergillosis prophylaxis, but data are limited regarding the safety and efficacy of these 
formulations among HSCT recipients. Additionally, itraconazole capsules are not 
recommended for fungal prophylaxis among HSCT recipients 
(<I>191</I>) (DII) for three reasons. First, itraconazole capsules are poorly absorbed gastrointestinally, particularly among 
patients who are fasting (<I>192</I>) or receiving cytotoxic agents 
(<I>193</I>). Second, persons taking itraconazole capsules do not achieve steady-state serum levels for 2 weeks 
(<I>188,194</I>), and when achieved, these levels are lower than the average 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) among HSCT recipients 
(<I>195</I>). Third, itraconazole has adverse interactions with other drugs (e.g., antiepileptics, rifampin, 
oral hypoglycemics, protease inhibitors, vinca alkaloids, cyclosporine, 
methylprednisolone, and warfarin-like anticoagulants) 
(<I>196</I>). Trials assessing the efficacy of the recently 
licensed cyclodextrin oral solution and intravenous formulations of itraconazole in 
preventing invasive fungal disease among HSCT recipients are in progress; however, 
no recommendations regarding its use for 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species infection prophylaxis can 
be made. For HSCT recipients whose respiratory specimens are culture positive for 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species, acute invasive aspergillosis should be diagnosed presumptively 
(<I>197</I>) and treated preemptively and aggressively (e.g., with intravenous amphotericin) (AIII).
</P><P>The risk for aspergillosis recurrence has been high among allogeneic recipients 
with preexisting invasive aspergillosis. Previously, allogeneic HSCTs were avoided 
among persons with uncontrolled, proven aspergillosis. However, HSCT center personnel 
have recently reported successful allogeneic or autologous HSCT among a limited number 
of persons who have had successfully treated, prior invasive pulmonary aspergillosis 
(<I>198--200</I>). Because of limited data, no recommendations regarding strategies for 
preventing aspergillosis recurrence can be made.

<h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding PCP</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure
</I></B>
</P><P>Although a possible cause of PCP is reactivation of latent infection 
among immunocompromised persons, cases of person-to-person transmission of PCP have 
been reported (<I>201--206</I>). Generally, standard precautions should be used for patients 
with PCP (<I>62</I>) (BIII), but researchers have reported patients with PCP being isolated 
(<I>201,204</I>) and contact precautions being used if evidence existed of person-to-person 
transmission in the institution (CIII). This subject remains controversial, and until further data 
are published, HSCT recipients should avoid exposure to persons with PCP 
(<I>62</I>) (CIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease and Disease Recurrence</I></B>
</P><P>Physicians should prescribe PCP prophylaxis for allogeneic recipients throughout 
all periods of immunocompromise (<I>207</I>) after engraftment. Prophylaxis should be 
administered from engraftment until 6 months after HSCT (AII) for all patients, and &gt;6 
months after HSCT for the duration of immunosuppression for those who a) are receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. prednisone or cyclosporine) (AI), or b) have chronic 
GVHD (BII). However, PCP prophylaxis can be initiated before engraftment if engraftment 
is delayed (CIII). Researchers report an additional 1- to 2-week course of PCP 
prophylaxis before HSCT (i.e., day --14 to day --2) (CIII).
</P><P>Preferred PCP prophylaxis is TMP-SMZ (AII); however, if TMP-SMZ is 
administered before engraftment, the associated myelosuppression could delay engraftment, 
and patients might experience sensitivity to the drug. Every effort should be made to 
keep such patients on the drug, including assessment of desensitization therapy, although 
data regarding this technique among HSCT recipients are limited. For patients who 
cannot tolerate TMP-SMZ, physicians can choose to use alternative PCP prophylaxis 
regimens (e.g., dapsone) (<I>208</I>) (BIII). Use of aerosolized pentamidine 
(<I>209</I>) is associated with the lowest PCP prevention rates and should only be used if other agents cannot be 
tolerated. Atovaquone is a possible alternative drug for PCP prophylaxis among 
dapsone-intolerant persons with HIV infection 
(<I>210</I>); however, no recommendation regarding use 
of atovaquone among HSCT recipients can be made because of lack of data. Although 
data are limited, concomitant use of leucovorin (folinic acid) and TMP-SMZ is not 
recommended (<I>211,212</I>) (DIII). A patient's history of PCP should not be regarded as a 
contraindication to HSCT (<I>213</I>) (DIII).
</P><P>Recurrent PCP among HSCT recipients is rare; however, patients with continued 
immunosuppression should remain on PCP prophylaxis until their immunosuppression 
is resolved (AI). The regimen recommended for preventing toxoplasmosis 
recurrence among HSCT recipients (i.e., TMP-SMZ) will also prevent PCP recurrence.
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>PCP prophylaxis should be considered for autologous recipients who have 
underlying hematologic malignancies (i.e., lymphoma or leukemia), are receiving intense 
conditioning regimens or graft manipulation, or have recently received fludarabine or 
2-CDA (<I>207,214</I>) (BIII). PCP prophylaxis should be administered 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months after HSCT if substantial immunosuppression or immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., steroids) persists 
(CIII). Use of PCP prophylaxis among other autologous recipients is controversial (CIII). 
Generally, indications for PCP prophylaxis are the same among children or adults, but 
pediatric doses should be used (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding <I>Toxoplasma gondii</I></B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>All HSCT recipients should be provided information regarding strategies to 
reduce their risk for <I>Toxoplasma</I> species exposure. Researchers report that potential donors 
for allogeneic HSCT be tested for <I>To. 
gondii</I> antibodies (<I>215,216</I>) by using FDA-licensed or 
-approved screening tests that include IgG antibody testing because 
<I>To. gondii</I> has been reported to be transmitted by leukocyte transfusion 
(<I>217</I>) and HSCT (<I>218,219</I>) (CIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease and Disease Recurrence</I></B>
</P><P>Because most toxoplasmosis among HSCT recipients is caused by disease 
reactivation, researchers report that candidates for allogeneic HSCT can be tested for IgG 
antibody to determine whether they are at risk for disease reactivation after 
HSCT (<I>215,216,218</I>) (CIII). However, the value of such testing is controversial because a 
limited number of patients who were seronegative for 
<I>To. gondii</I> pretransplant experienced the infection posttransplant 
(<I>220</I>). If testing is performed, only FDA-licensed or 
-approved screening tests should be used.
</P><P> Researchers recommend toxoplasmosis prophylaxis for seropositive allogeneic 
recipients with active GVHD or a prior history of toxoplasmic chorioretinitis 
(<I>221,222</I>), but data demonstrating efficacy are limited (CIII). The optimal prophylactic regimen for 
toxoplasmosis among HSCT recipients has not been determined, but a proposed drug is 
TMP-SMZ (BII), although allogeneic recipients have experienced break-through clinical 
disease despite TMP-SMZ prophylaxis (<I>218</I>). For patients who are TMP-SMZ--intolerant, 
a combination of clindamycin, pyramethamine, and leucovorin can be substituted for 
<I>To. gondii</I> prophylaxis (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). After therapy for toxoplasmosis, HSCT recipients 
should continue receiving suppressive doses of TMP-SMZ or an alternate regimen for the 
duration of their immunosuppression (BIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>Recipients of autologous transplants are at negligible risk for toxoplasmosis

</P><h4>

</P><P>Allogeneic recipients should avoid contact with outhouses and cutaneous 
exposure to soil or other surfaces that might be contaminated with human feces 
(<I>223</I>) (AIII). Allogeneic recipients who work in settings (e.g., hospitals or institutions) where they could 
be exposed to fecal matter should wear gloves when working with patients or in areas 
with potential fecal contamination (AIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease and Disease Recurrence</I></B>
</P><P>Travel and residence histories should be obtained for all patients before HSCT 
to determine any exposures to high-risk areas (e.g., such moist temperate areas as 
the 

tropics, subtropics, or the southeastern United States and Europe) 
(<I>223</I>) (BIII). HSCT candidates who have unexplained peripheral eosinophilia or who have resided in 
or traveled to areas endemic for strongyloidiasis, even during the distant past, should 
be screened for asymptomatic strongyloidiasis before HSCT (BIII). Serologic testing with 
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay is the preferred screening method and has a 
sensitivity and specificity of &gt;90% 
(<I>223,224</I>) (BIII). FDA-licensed or -approved 
screening tests should be used. Although stool examinations for strongyloidiasis are specific, 
the sensitivity obtained from <U>&gt;</U>3 stool examinations is 60%--70%; the sensitivity 
obtained from concentrated stool exams is, at best, 80% 
(<I>223</I>). A total of <U>&gt;</U>3 stool 
examinations should be performed if serologic tests are unavailable or if strongyloidiasis is 
clinically suspected in a seronegative patient (BIII).
</P><P>HSCT candidates whose screening tests before HSCT are positive for 
<I>Strongyloides</I> species, and those with an unexplained eosinophilia and a travel or residence 
history indicative of exposure to <I>Strongyloides

before transplantation (<I>225,226</I>), preferably with ivermectin (BIII), even if seronegative or 
stool-negative (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>).
</P><P>To prevent recurrence among HSCT candidates with parasitologically 
confirmed strongyloidiasis, cure after therapy should be verified with 
<U>&gt;</U>3 consecutive negative stool examinations before proceeding with HSCT (AIII). Data are insufficient to recommend 
a drug prophylaxis regimen after HSCT to prevent recurrence of strongyloidiasis. 
HSCT recipients who had strongyloidiasis before or after HSCT should be monitored 
carefully for signs and symptoms of recurrent infection for 6 months after treatment (BIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>Hyperinfection strongyloidiasis has not been reported after autologous HSCT;

</P><h4>
<B>Recommendations Regarding <I>Trypanosoma cruzi</I></B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Exposure</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT physicians should be aware that <I>Trypanosoma 
cruzi</I>, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, can be transmitted congenitally, through blood transfusion 
(<I>227</I>), and possibly through HSCT. Additionally, treatment for persons infected with 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> is not always effective, even during the acute stage of infection 
(<I>227</I>). Therefore, potential donors who were born, received a blood transfusion, or ever lived for 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months in a Chagas' disease endemic area (e.g., parts of South and Central America and 
Mexico) should be screened serologically for 
anti-<I>Tr. cruzi</I> serum IgG antibody 
(<I>228</I>) (BIII). Persons who lived &lt;6 months in a Chagas'-endemic area but who had high-risk living 
conditions (e.g., having had extensive exposure to the Chagas' disease vector --- the 
reduviid bug --- or having lived in dwellings with mud walls, unmilled logs and sticks, or a 
thatched roof) should also be screened for evidence of 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> infection (BIII). Because Chagas' disease can be transmitted congenitally, researchers report that any person with 
extensive multigenerational maternal family histories of cardiac disease (e.g., 
cardiomegaly and arrhythmias) should be screened serologically for serum IgG 
anti-<I>Tr. cruzi</I> antibodies 

(<I>227</I>) (CIII). To decrease the risk for misdiagnosis by false-positive or 
false-negative serologic tests, <I>Tr. cruzi</I> screening should consist of 
<U>&gt;</U>2 conventional serologic tests (e.g., enzyme immunoassay, indirect hemagglutination, indirect fluorescent antibody) or 
<U>&gt;</U>1 conventional serologic tests, followed by a confirmatory serologic test 
(e.g., radioimmunoprecipitation assay) (<I>229</I>) (BIII). Persons with active Chagas' disease 
should not serve as HSCT donors (DIII). Researchers also recommend deferral of HSCT 
donation for a past history of Chagas' disease (CIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Disease</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates who are at risk for being infected with 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> should be screened for serum IgG 
anti-<I>Tr. cruzi</I> antibody (<I>228</I>) (BIII). 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> seropositivity is not a contraindication to HSCT 
(<I>228,230</I>). However, if an acute illness occurs in a 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I>-seropositive HSCT recipient, particularly during neutropenia, 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> reactivation should be included in the differential diagnosis 
(<I>230</I>) (BIII). Researchers have proposed use of beznidazole 
or nifurtimox for preemptive therapy or prophylaxis of recurrent 
<I>Tr. cruzi</I> among seropositive HSCT recipients 
(<I>230,231</I>), but insufficient data were found to make a

</P><P>
<B><I>Other Recommendations</I></B>
</P><P>Recommendations are the same for autologous or allogeneic recipients. 
However, recurrence of Chagas' disease is probably less likely to occur among autologous

the same among children or adults.
<H3>
<B>HOSPITAL INFECTION CONTROL</B>
</H3>
<h4>
<B>Room Ventilation</B>
</h4><P>HSCT center personnel should follow published guidelines for hospital room 
design and ventilation (<I>140,180</I>) (BIII). HSCT centers should also prevent birds from 
gaining access to hospital air-intake ducts 
(<I>140,174</I>) (AII). All allogeneic recipients should 
be placed in rooms with &gt;12 air exchanges/hour 
(<I>232,233</I>) and point-of-use HEPA filters 
that are capable of removing particles <U>&gt;</U>0.3 &#181;m in diameter 
(<I>140,178,180,233</I>) (AIII). Correct filtration is critical in HSCT centers with ongoing construction and renovation 
(<I>179</I>). When portable HEPA filters are used as adjuncts to the primary ventilation system, they 
must be placed centrally in patient rooms so that space is available around all surfaces to 
allow free air circulation (BIII). The need for environmental HEPA filtration for autologous 
recipients has not been established. However, HEPA-filtered rooms should be 
evaluated for autologous recipients if they experience prolonged neutropenia, a substantial 
risk factor for nosocomial aspergillosis (CIII).
</P><P>A laminar air flow (LAF) room contains filtered air that moves in parallel, 
unidirectional flow --- the air enters the room from one wall and exits the room on the 
opposite wall (<I>232</I>). Although LAF has been demonstrated to protect patients from infection 
during aspergillosis outbreaks related to hospital construction 
(<I>234,235</I>), the value of routine 

LAF room use for all HSCT recipients is doubtful because substantial overall 
survival benefit has not been reported (<I>236</I>). During 1983, LAF rooms were preferred for 
allogeneic recipients with aplastic anemia and HLA-identical sibling donors because use 
of regular rooms was associated with a mortality rate that was approximately four 
times higher than for those recipients treated in LAF rooms 
(<I>237</I>). However, the survival of aplastic anemia HSCT recipients during the late 1990s exceeds that reported during 
the early 1980s, and no studies have been done to determine whether HSCT recipients 
with aplastic anemia still have an improved survival rate when treated in an LAF 
room. Therefore, HSCT centers need not construct LAF rooms for each HSCT recipient. Use 
of LAF rooms, if available, is optional (CII).
</P><P>Hospital rooms should have directed airflow so that air intake occurs at one side of 
the room and air exhaust occurs at the opposite side 
(<I>140</I>) (BIII). Each hospital room should also be well-sealed (e.g, around windows and electrical outlets) 
(<I>140</I>) (BIII). To provide consistent positive pressure in the recipient's room, HSCT centers should maintain 
consistent pressure differentials between the patient's room and the hallway or anteroom 
at &gt;2.5 Pa (i.e., 0.01 inches by water gauge) 
(<I>232,233</I>) (BIII). Generally, hospital rooms 
for HSCT recipients should have positive room air pressure when compared with any 
adjoining hallways, toilets, and anterooms, if present.
</P><P>Anterooms should have positive air pressure compared with hallways 
(<I>180</I>). An exception is the HSCT recipient with an active disease that has airborne 
transmission (e.g., pulmonary or laryngeal <I>Mycobacteria 
tuberculosis</I> [TB] or measles). These HSCT patients should be placed in negative isolation rooms 
(<I>62</I>) (BIII), and a room with an anteroom is recommended for such patients 
(<I>180</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>Whenever possible, HSCT centers should have self-closing doors to maintain 
constant pressure differentials among the HSCT recipients' room and anterooms, if 
available, and hallways (<I>233</I>) (BIII). To enable the nursing staff to observe the HSCT 
recipient even when the doors are closed, windows can be installed in either the door or the 
wall of the HSCT recipient's room (<I>233</I>) (CIII).
</P><P>HSCT centers should provide backup emergency power and redundant 
air-handling and pressurization systems to maintain a constant number of air exchanges and 
room pressurization in the center when the central ventilation system is shut off for 
maintenance and repair (<I>238</I>) (BIII). Additionally, infection control personnel should work 
with maintenance personnel to develop protocols to protect HSCT centers at all times 
from bursts of mold spores that might occur when air-handling systems are restarted 
after routine maintenance shut-downs (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Construction, Renovation, and Building Cleaning</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Construction and Renovation</I></B>
</P><P>Hospital construction and renovation have been associated with an increased risk 
for nosocomial fungal infection, particularly aspergillosis, among severely 
immuno-compromised patients (<I>175,176</I>). Therefore, persons responsible for HSCT center 
construction or renovation should consult published recommendations regarding 
environmental controls during construction 
(<I>239,240</I>) (AIII).
</P><P>Whenever possible, HSCT recipients, HCWs, and visitors should avoid construction 
or renovation areas (<I>240</I>) (AIII). Also, equipment and supplies used by HSCT recipients 
or 

their HCWs should not be exposed to construction or renovation areas 
(<I>240</I>). When planning for construction or renovation, the HSCT center should include plans for 
intensified aspergillosis-control measures (AIII). Construction and renovation infection 
control planning committees should include engineers, architects, housekeeping staff, 
infection control personnel, the director of the HSCT center, the administration, and safety 
officers (<I>241</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>When constructing new HSCT centers, planners should ensure that patient rooms 
will have adequate capacity to minimize fungal spore counts by following room 
ventilation recommendations. During outdoor construction and demolition, the intake air should 
be sealed (BIII), if possible; if not, filters should be checked frequently. Additionally, to 
protect HSCT patient care areas during fire drills and emergencies, weather stripping should 
be placed around stairwell doors, or alternatively, the stairwell air should be filtered to 
the level of safety of the adjacent hospital air (BIII). False ceilings should be avoided 
whenever possible (<I>174</I>) (BII). If use of false ceilings cannot be avoided, the area above 
false ceilings should be vacuumed routinely to minimize dust and, therefore, fungal 
exposure to patients (<I>174</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>During hospital construction or renovation, hospitals should construct rigid, 
dust-proof barriers with airtight seals 
(<I>242</I>) between patient care and construction or 
renovation areas to prevent dust from entering patient care areas; these barriers (i.e., 
sealed drywall) should be impermeable to 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species 
(<I>140,175,176,179,240</I>) (BIII). If impervious barriers cannot be created around the construction or renovation area, 
patients should be moved from the area until renovation or construction is complete 
and the area has been cleaned appropriately 
(<I>176</I>) (BIII). HSCT centers should direct 
pedestrian traffic occurring near construction or renovation areas away from patient 
care areas to limit the opening and closing of doors or other barriers that might cause 
dust dispersion, entry of contaminated air, or tracking of dust into patient areas 
(<I>140</I>), particularly those in the HSCT center 
(<I>176</I>) (BIII). If possible, specific corridors, entrances, 
and exits should be dedicated to construction use only 
(<I>240</I>). An elevator to which patients do not have access also should be dedicated to construction use only 
(<I>240</I>). Construction workers, whose clothing might be contaminated with 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species spores, should use the construction elevator and avoid contact with patients, patient care areas, 
other elevators, and nonconstruction areas (BIII).
</P><P>Hospital construction or renovation areas should have negative air pressure 
relative to that in adjacent patient care areas, if no contraindications exist for such 
pressure differential (<I>140,176,179,240,242</I>) (BIII). Ideally, air from the construction or 
renovation areas should be exhausted to the outside of the hospital 
(<I>176</I>) (BIII) or if recirculated, it should be HEPA-filtered first (BIII).
</P><P>Researchers have proposed that HSCT recipients wear the N95 respirator to 
prevent mold exposure during transportation near hospital construction or renovation 
areas (CIII) because the N95 respirators are regarded as effective against any aerosol. 
However, to be maximally effective, N95 respirators must be fit-tested and all users must 
be trained. With correct personnel fit-testing and training, N95 respirators reliably 
reduce aerosol exposure by 90%. Without fit-testing and training, aerosol exposure would 
be reduced but not necessarily by 90% (<I>243</I>). For patients who cannot use or tolerate 
an N95 respirator, researchers have proposed using the powered air purifying 
respirator (<I>244,245</I>), which can be used by patients in wheelchairs. Limitations of the powered 
air purifying respirator include its cost and that it is not appropriate for young children 
and infants. General limitations of using respirators are that no commercially available 
respi

rator, including N95, has been tested specifically for its efficacy in reducing exposure 
to <I>Aspergillus</I> species in hospital construction or renovation areas, and no studies 
have been done that assess the usefulness and acceptability of using respirators among 
HSCT recipients. Standard surgical masks provide negligible protection against mold 
spores and are not recommended for this indication (DIII).
</P><P>Newly constructed or renovated areas should be cleaned before patients are 
allowed to enter them (<I>140,176</I>) (AIII). Decontamination of fungal-contaminated areas that 
cannot be extracted and replaced should be done using copper-8-quinolate 
(<I>179</I>) (BIII). Also, areas above false ceilings located under or adjacent to construction areas should 
be vacuumed (<I>174</I>) (BIII). Additionally, the ventilation, direction of airflow, and room 
pressurization should be tested and correctly adjusted before patients are allowed to enter (BIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Cleaning</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT centers should be cleaned <U>&gt;</U>1 times/day with special attention to dust 
control (BIII). Exhaust vents, window sills, and all horizontal surfaces should be cleaned 
with cloths and mop heads that have been premoistened with an FDA- or 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered hospital disinfectant (BIII). Thorough cleaning 
during and after any construction activity, including minor renovation projects, is critical (BIII).
</P><P>HSCT center personnel should prohibit exposures of patients to such activities 
as vacuuming or other floor or carpet vacuuming that could cause aerosolization of 
fungal spores (e.g., <I>Aspergillus</I> species) 
(<I>140</I>) (AIII). Accordingly, doors to patient rooms 
should be closed when vacuuming HSCT center corridors. All vacuum cleaners used in 
the HSCT center should be fitted with HEPA filters. An FDA- or EPA-registered 
disinfectant (<I>246,247</I>) should be used daily for environmental disinfection and when wet 
vacuuming is performed in the HSCT center (BIII). If an HSCT center provides care for infants, 
phenolic disinfectants can be used to clean the floors only if the compound is diluted 
according to the product label; but phenolic compounds should not be used to clean basinets 
or incubators (<I>246</I>) (DIII).
</P><P>Water leaks should be cleaned up and repaired as soon as possible but within 
72 hours to prevent mold proliferation in floor and wall coverings, ceiling tiles, and 
cabinetry in and around all HSCT patients care areas (BIII). If cleanup and repair are delayed 
<U>&gt;</U>72 hours after the water leak, the involved materials should be assumed to contain 
fungi and handled accordingly. Use of a moisture meter to detect water penetration of 
walls should be used whenever possible to guide decision-making 
(<I>238</I>) (BIII). For example, if the wall does not have &lt;20% moisture content 
<U>&gt;</U>72 hours after water penetration, it should be removed (BIII). Design and selection of furnishings should focus on 
creating and maintaining a dust-free environment. Flooring and finishes (i.e., wall coverings, 
window shades, and countertops) used in HSCT centers should be scrubbable, 
nonporous, easily disinfected, and they should collect minimal dust (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Isolation and Barrier Precautions</B>
</h4><P>HSCT center personnel should follow published guidelines for hospital isolation 
practices, including CDC guidelines for preventing nosocomial infections 
(<I>62,140,248</I>) (AIII). However, the efficacy of specific isolation and barrier precautions in preventing 
noso-comial infections among HSCT recipients has not been evaluated.
</P><P>HSCT recipients should be placed in private (i.e., single-patient) rooms (BIII). If 
contact 

with body fluids is anticipated, standard precautions should be followed (AIII). 
These precautions include hand washing and wearing appropriate gloves, surgical masks 
or eye and face protection, and gowns during procedures and activities that are likely 
to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions, or 
cause soiling of clothing (<I>62</I>). When indicated, HSCT recipients should also be placed on 
airborne, droplet, or contact precautions in addition to standard precautions 
(<I>62</I>) (AIII). Careful observation of isolation precautions is critical in preventing transmission of  
infectious agents among HSCT recipients, HCWs, visitors, and other HSCT recipients. 
Physicians are cautioned that HSCT recipients might have a prolonged or episodic 
excretion of organisms (e.g., CMV).
</P><P>Researchers have proposed that HSCT recipients wear surgical mask and 
gloves when exiting their hospital rooms before engraftment (CIII). All HSCT recipients who 
are immunocompromised (phases I--III of immune system recovery) and candidates 
undergoing conditioning therapy should minimize the time spent in crowded areas of the 
hospital (e.g., waiting areas and elevators) (BIII) to minimize potential exposure to 
persons with CRV infections.
</P><h4>
<B>Hand Hygiene</B>
</h4><P>Hand washing is the single-most critical and effective procedure for preventing 
nosocomial infection (<I>62</I>). All persons, but particularly HCWs, should wash their hands 
before entering and after leaving the rooms of HSCT recipients and candidates 
undergoing conditioning therapy (<I>62,249</I>) or before and after any direct contact with patients 
regardless of whether they were soiled from the patient, environment, or objects (AI). 
HSCT recipients should be encouraged to practice safe hand hygiene (e.g., washing 
hands before eating, after using the toilet, and before and after touching a wound) (BIII). 
Hand washing should be done with an antimicrobial soap and water (AIII); alternatively, use 
of hygienic hand rubs is another acceptable means of maintaining hand hygiene 
(<I>250,251</I>). If gloves are worn, HCWs should put them on in the patient's room after hand 
washing and then discard them in the same patient's room before washing hands again 
after exiting the room. When worn, gloves should always be changed between patients 
or when soiled before touching a clean area (e.g., change gloves after touching the 
perineum and before going to a &quot;clean&quot; area) (AIII). Appropriate gloves should be used by 
all persons when handling potentially contaminated biological materials (AII). Items 
worn on the hands and fingers (e.g., rings or artificial nails 
[<I>248,252</I>]) and adhesive bandage strips, can create a nidus for pathogenic organisms that is difficult to clean. Thus, 
HCWs should avoid wearing such items whenever possible (BII).
</P><h4>
<B>Equipment</B>
</h4><P>All HSCT center personnel should sterilize or disinfect and maintain equipment 
and devices using only EPA-registered compounds as directed by established 
guidelines (<I>140,180,246,247,253--256</I>) (AIII). HSCT center personnel should monitor opened 
and unopened wound-dressing supplies (e.g., adhesive bandages 
[<I>257,258</I>] and surgical and elastic adhesive tape 
[<I>259</I>]) to detect mold contamination and prevent subsequent 
cutaneous transmission to patients (BII).
</P><P>Monitoring should consist of discarding all bandages and wound dressings that 
are out of date, have damaged packaging, or are visually contaminated by 
construction debris or moisture (BIII). When arm boards are used to provide support for 
intravenous 

lines, only sterile dressing materials should be used 
(<I>260</I>), and arm boards should be changed frequently (e.g., daily) (BIII). Additionally, unsterile tongue depressors 
inserted into a piece of foam tubing should not be used as splints for intravenous and 
arterial catheter sites because these have been associated with an outbreak of fatal 
invasive nosocomial <I>Rhizopus microsporus</I> among preterm (i.e., very low-birth--weight) 
infants (<I>261</I>) (DII). HSCT centers should not install carpeting in hallways outside (DII) or in 
patient rooms (DIII) because contaminated carpeting has been associated with outbreaks 
of aspergillosis among HSCT recipients 
(<I>262,263</I>).
</P><h4>
<B>Plants, Play Areas, and Toys</B>
</h4><P>Although to date, exposure to plants and flowers has not been conclusively 
reported to cause fungal infections among HSCT recipients, most researchers strongly 
recommend that plants and dried or fresh flowers should not be allowed in the rooms of 
hospitalized HSCT candidates undergoing conditioning therapy and HSCT recipients (phases 
I--III of immune system recovery) because 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species have been isolated from the soil of potted ornamental plants (e.g., cacti), the surface of dried flower 
arrangements, and fresh flowers 
(<I>140,174,178,264</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>Play areas for pediatric HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy should be cleaned and disinfected 
<U>&gt;</U>1 times/week and as needed (BIII). Only 
toys, games, and videos that can be kept clean and disinfected should be allowed in the 
HSCT center (BIII). HSCT centers should follow published recommendations for washing 
and disinfecting toys (<I>265</I>) (BIII). All HSCT center toys, games, and videos should be 
routinely and thoroughly washed or wiped down when brought into the HSCT center and 
thereafter <U>&gt;</U>1 times/week and as needed by using a nontoxic FDA- or EPA-registered 
disinfectant (<I>246,247,265</I>) followed by a water rinse (BIII). Cloth or plush toys should be washed in 
a hot cycle of a washing machine or dry-cleaned 
<U>&gt;</U>1 times/week and as needed (BIII). Alternatively, machine washing in a cold cycle is acceptable if laundry chemicals for 
cold water washing are used in proper concentration 
(<I>265</I>). Hard plastic toys should be scrubbed with warm soapy water using a brush to clean crevices, rinsed in clean 
water, immersed in a mild bleach solution, which should be made fresh daily, for 10--20 
minutes, rinsed again, and allowed to air dry 
(<I>246</I>). Alternatively, hard plastic toys can be 
washed in a dishwasher or hot cycle of a washing machine (BIII). Broviac dolls****** should 
be disassembled upon completion of play and washed with a nontoxic FDA- or 
EPA-registered disinfectant (<I>246,247</I>), rinsed with tap water, and allowed to air dry before 
other children are allowed to play with them (BIII). Toys that cannot be washed, disinfected, 
or dry-cleaned after use should be avoided (BIII). Infants, toddlers, and children who 
put toys in their mouths should not share toys 
(<I>265</I>) (DIII). For children in isolation, 
researchers recommend the following:
<UL>
<LI> Disposable play items should be offered whenever possible (BIII).
<LI> Before returning a washable toy used in an isolation room to the pediatric play 
room for use by another child, it should be cleaned again as previously described 
(BIII).
<LI> When a child is taken out of isolation, toys, games, and videos used during 
the period of isolation and that might serve as fomites for infection should 
be thoroughly disinfected with a nontoxic FDA- or EPA-registered 
disinfectant (<I>246,247,265</I>) (BIII). After use in isolation rooms, cloth or plush toys should 
be placed in a plastic bag and separated from unused toys. All cloth or plush 
toys used in isolation rooms should be washed in a washing machine or 
dry-cleaned before being used in a nonisolation room (BIII). Toys that cannot be disinfected 
or dry-cleaned after use in an isolation room should be discarded (BIII).
</UL>
Water-retaining bath toys have been associated with an outbreak of 
<I>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</I> in a pediatric oncology ward 
(<I>266</I>); therefore, these toys should not be 
used by immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates (DII). Occupational 
and physical therapy items should be cleaned and disinfected as previously described 
(BIII). Soil-based materials (e.g., clay or potting soil) should be avoided (BIII).
<h4>
<B>HCWs</B>
</h4><P>HSCT center personnel should have a written comprehensive policy regarding 
their immunizations and vaccinations, and that policy should meet current CDC, 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and Healthcare Infection Control Practices 
Advisory Committee recommendations (<I>267</I>) (BIII). Immunizations are needed to 
prevent transmission of vaccine-preventable diseases to HSCT recipients and candidates 
undergoing conditioning therapy. All HCWs with diseases transmissible by air, droplet, 
and direct contact (e.g., VZV, infectious gastroenteritis, HSV lesions of lips or fingers, 
and URIs) should be restricted from patient contact and temporarily reassigned to 
other duties (AI). HSCT center personnel should follow published recommendations 
regarding the duration of work restrictions for HCWs with infectious diseases 
(<I>268,269</I>) (BIII). HSCT center HCWs with bloodborne viruses (e.g., HIV or hepatitis B or C viruses) should not 
be restricted from patient contact (DIII) as long as they do not perform procedures that 
pose a high risk for injury that could result in patient exposure to the HCW's blood or 
body fluids. Work exclusion policies should be designed to encourage HCWs to report 
their illnesses or exposures (AII).
</P><h4>
<B>HSCT Center Visitors</B>
</h4><P>Hospitals should have written policies for screening HSCT center visitors, 
particularly children, for potentially infectious conditions. Such screening should be performed 
by clinically trained HCWs (BII). Visitors who might have communicable infectious 
diseases (e.g., URIs, flu-like illnesses, recent exposure to communicable diseases, an active 
shingles rash whether covered or not, a VZV-like rash within 6 weeks of receiving a 
live-attenuated VZV vaccine, or a history of receiving an oral polio vaccine within the previous 
3--6 weeks) should not be allowed in the HSCT center or allowed to have direct contact 
with HSCT recipients or candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (AII). No absolute 
minimum age requirement for HSCT center visitors exists; however, all visitors must be 
able to understand and follow appropriate hand washing and isolation precautions (AIII). 
The number of HSCT center visitors at any one time should be restricted to a number 
that permits the nursing staff to perform appropriate screening for contagious diseases 
and adequate instruction and supervision of hand washing, glove and mask use, and 
biosafety precautions (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Patient Skin and Oral Care</B>
</h4><P>To optimize skin care, HSCT recipients should take daily showers or baths during 
and after transplantation (BIII), using a mild soap (BIII). Skin care during neutropenia 
should also include daily inspection of skin sites likely to be portals of infection (e.g., the 
perineum and intravascular access sites) (BIII). HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy should maintain good perineal hygiene to minimize loss of skin 
integrity and risk for infection (BIII). To facilitate this precaution, HSCT center personnel 
should develop protocols for patient perineal care, including recommendations for gentle 
but thorough perineal cleaning after each bowel movement and thorough drying of 
the perineum after each urination (BIII). Females should always wipe the perineum 
from front to back after using the toilet to prevent fecal contamination of the urethra 
and urinary tract infections (AIII). Moreover, to prevent vaginal irritation, 
menstruating immunocompromised HSCT recipients should not use tampons (DIII) to avoid the risk 
for cervical and vaginal abrasions. Additionally, the use of rectal thermometers, 
enemas, suppositories, and rectal exams are contraindicated among HSCT recipients to 
avoid skin or mucosal breakdown (DIII).
</P><P>All HSCT candidates and their caregivers should be educated regarding the 
importance of maintaining good oral and dental hygiene for at least the first year after HSCT 
to reduce the risk for oral and dental infections (AIII). For example, HSCT candidates 
should be informed that establishment of the best possible periodontal health before HSCT is 
a substantial step in avoiding short- and long-term oral infections and that maintenance 
of safe oral hygiene after HSCT can minimize the severity of infections and facilitate 
healing of mucositis, particularly before engraftment (BIII).
</P><P>All HSCT candidates should receive a dental evaluation and relevant treatment 
before conditioning therapy begins (<I>270,271</I>) (AIII). Likely sources of dental infection 
should be vigorously eliminated (<I>271</I>) (AIII). For example, teeth with moderate to severe 
caries should be restored; ill-fitting dental prostheses should be repaired; and teeth 
compromised by moderate to severe periodontal disease should be extracted 
(<I>271</I>). Ideally, 10--14 days should elapse between the completion of tissue-invasive oral procedures 
and onset of conditioning therapy to allow for adequate healing and monitoring for 
postsurgical complications (AIII).
</P><P>HSCT recipients with mucositis and HSCT candidates undergoing conditioning 
therapy should maintain safe oral hygiene by performing oral rinses 4--6 times/day with 
sterile water, normal saline, or sodium bicarbonate solutions 
(<I>270</I>) (AIII). HSCT recipients and candidates should brush their teeth 
<U>&gt;</U>2 times/day with a soft regular toothbrush 
(<I>270</I>) (BIII). If the recipient cannot tolerate these brushings, use of an ultrasoft toothbrush 
or toothette (i.e., foam swab on a stick), can be used (CIII), but physicians should be 
aware that using the latter products are less desirable than using soft regular or ultrasoft 
toothbrushes because the toothettes remove less dental debris 
(<I>270</I>). Using toothpaste is optional, depending on the recipient's tolerance 
(<I>270</I>) (CIII). HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy who are skilled at dental flossing should 
floss daily if this can be done without trauma (BIII). Routine dental supervision is advised 
to monitor and guide the patient's maintenance of oral and dental hygiene (BIII). To 
decrease the risk for mechanical trauma and infection of oral mucosa, fixed 
orthodontic appliances and space maintainers should not be worn from the start of 
conditioning therapy until preengraftment mucositis resolves, and these devices should not be 
worn during any subsequent periods of mucositis 
(<I>270</I>) (DIII). Dental and transplant teams 
and 

the patient's community dentist should coordinate removal of these appliances and 
long-term rehabilitation of any oral lesions (BIII). However, patients who normally wear 
removable dental prostheses might be able to wear them during conditioning 
therapy before HSCT and during mucositis after HSCT, depending on the degree of tissue 
integrity at the denture-bearing sites and the ability of the patient to maintain denture 
hygiene on a daily basis (CIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Preventing Bacterial Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections</B>
</h4><P>HSCT center personnel are advised to implement published guidelines for 
preventing intravascular device-related infections 
(<I>33</I>) (AIII). Contact with tap water at the 
central venous catheter site should be avoided (BIII). For long-term central venous access 
among children, HSCT physicians can use a totally implantable device among children aged 
&lt;4 years if the anticipated duration of vascular access is &gt;30 days (CII). However, such 
a device among children aged &lt;4 years is not generally used as the actual HSCT 
infusion site because a) problems with skin fragility contraindicate repeated punctures over 
the port site and b) the port device might have an insufficient number of lumens for 
optimal patient management immediately after HSCT.
</P><P>To prevent bloodstream infections associated with needleless intravenous 
access devices, HSCT recipients should a) cover and protect the catheter tip or end cap 
during bathing or showering to protect it from tap water contamination, b) change the device 
in accordance with manufacturers' recommendations, if available, and c) have a 
caregiver perform intravenous infusions whenever possible 
(<I>272,273</I>) (BII). Also, HSCT recipients and their caregivers should be educated regarding proper care of needleless 
intravenous access devices (<I>272</I>) (BII). No recommendation regarding the use of 
antibiotic-impregnated central venous catheters among HSCT recipients can be made because 
of lack of data.
</P><h4>
<B>Control of Specific Nosocomial Infections</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding </I>Legionella <I>Species</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT physicians should always include Legionnaires' disease (LD) in the 
differential diagnosis of pneumonia among HSCT recipients 
(<I>140</I>) (AIII). Appropriate tests to confirm LD include a) culturing sputum, BAL, and tissue specimens; b) testing BAL specimens 
for <I>Legionellae</I> by direct fluorescent antibody; and c) testing for 
<I>Legionella pneumophila</I> serogroup 1 antigen in urine. The incubation period for LD is usually 2--10 days; 
thus, laboratory-confirmed legionellosis that occurs in a patient who has been 
hospitalized continuously for <U>&gt;</U>10 days before the onset of illness is regarded as a definite case 
of nosocomial LD, and a laboratory-confirmed infection that occurs 2--9 days after 
hospital admission is a possible case of nosocomial LD 
(<I>140</I>). When a case of laboratory-confirmed nosocomial LD 
(<I>274,275</I>) is identified in a person who was in the inpatient 
HSCT center during all or part of the 2--10 days before illness onset, or if two or more cases 
of laboratory-confirmed LD occur among patients who had visited an outpatient 
HSCT center, hospital personnel should
<UL>
<LI> report the case(s) to the local or state health department if the disease 
is reportable in that state or if assistance is needed 
(<I>140</I>) (AIII); and

<LI> in consultation with the hospital infection control team, conduct a 
thorough epidemiologic and environmental investigation to determine the 
likely environmental source(s) of 
<I>Legionella</I> species (e.g., showers, tap water 
faucets, cooling towers, and hot water tanks) 
(<I>274,276</I>) (AI).
</UL>
<P>The source of <I>Legionella</I> infection should be identified and decontaminated or 
removed (AIII). Extensive hospital investigations of an isolated case of possible 
nosocomial LD might not be indicated if the patient has had limited contact with the inpatient 
center during most of the incubation period (CIII). Because HSCT recipients are at much 
higher risk for disease and death from legionellosis compared with other hospitalized 
persons (<I>274</I>), periodic routine culturing for 
<I>Legionellae</I> in water samples from the center's 
potable water supply could be regarded as part of an overall strategy for preventing LD 
in HSCT centers (CIII). However, the optimal methodology (i.e., frequency or number 
of sites) for environmental surveillance cultures in HSCT centers has not been 
determined, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been evaluated. Because HSCT 
recipients are at high risk for LD and no data were found to determine a safe concentration 
of <I>Legionellae</I> organisms in potable water, the goal, if environmental surveillance 
for <I>Legionellae</I> is undertaken, should be to maintain water systems with no 
detectable organisms (AIII). Physicians should suspect legionellosis among HSCT recipients 
with nosocomial pneumonia even when environmental surveillance cultures do not 
yield <I>Legionellae</I> (AIII). If 
<I>Legionella</I> species are detected in the water supplying an 
HSCT center, the following should be done until 
<I>Legionella</I> species are no longer detected 
by culture:
<UL>
<LI> The water supply should be decontaminated 
(<I>140</I>) (AII).
<LI> HSCT recipients should be given sponge baths with water that is not 
contami-nated with <I>Legionella</I> species (e.g., not with the HSCT center's 
<I>Legionella</I> species-contaminated potable water system) (BIII).
<LI> Patients should not take showers in LD-contaminated water (DIII).
<LI> Water from faucets containing LD-contaminated water should not be used 
in patient rooms or the HSCT center and outpatient clinic to avoid creating 
infectious aerosols (CIII).
<LI> HSCT recipients should be given sterile water instead of tap water for 
drinking, brushing teeth, or flushing nasogastric tubes during Legionellosis outbreaks (BIII).
</UL>
HSCT center personnel should use only sterile water (i.e., not distilled unsterile 
water) for rinsing nebulization devices and other semicritical respiratory-care equipment 
after cleaning or disinfecting and for filling reservoirs of nebulization devices 
(<I>140</I>) (BII). HSCT centers should not use large-volume room air humidifiers that create aerosols (e.g., 
by Venturi principle, ultrasound, or spinning disk) and, thus, are actually nebulizers 
(<I>140</I>) (DI) unless these humidifier or nebulizers are sterilized or subjected to daily 
high-level disinfection and filled with sterile water only 
(<I>140</I>) (CIII).
<P>When a new hospital with an HSCT center is constructed, the cooling towers 
should be placed so that the tower drift is directed away from the hospital's air-intake 
system, and the cooling towers should be designed so that the volume of aerosol drift is 
minimized (<I>140</I>) (BII). For operational hospital cooling towers, hospitals should
<UL>
<LI> install drift eliminators,

<LI> regularly use an effective biocide,
<LI> maintain cooling towers according to the manufacturer's recommendations, and
<LI> keep adequate maintenance records 
(<I>140</I>) (BII).
</UL>
HSCT physicians are encouraged to consult published recommendations 
regarding preventing nosocomial Legionellosis 
(<I>140,277</I>) (BIII). No data were found to 
determine whether drinking tap water poses a risk for 
<I>Legionella</I> exposure among HSCT recipients in the absence of an outbreak.
<P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding Methicillin-Resistant</I>
Sta. aureus</B>
</P><P>HSCT center HCWs should follow basic infection control practices (e.g., hand 
washing between patients and use of barrier precautions, including wearing gloves 
whenever entering the methicillin-resistant <I>Sta. 
aureus</I> [MRSA] infected or colonized patient's room); these practices are essential for MRSA control 
(<I>62</I>) (AII). If MRSA is a substantial problem in the HSCT center and evidence exists of ongoing MRSA transmission, 
MRSA infected or colonized patients should be treated as a cohort (e.g., cared for exclusively 
by a limited number of HCWs) (BIII). HSCT transplant recipients with recurrent 
<I>Sta. aureus</I> infections should undergo extensive evaluation for persistent colonization, including 
cultures of nares, groin, axilla, and ostomy sites (e.g., tracheostomy or gastrointestinal 
tube) (BIII). For patients with recurrent MRSA infection, elimination of the carrier state 
should be attempted by applying a 2% mupirocin calcium ointment to the nares (BIII), 
although this strategy has been only marginally effective in certain institutions 
(<I>278</I>) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). High-level mupirocin-resistant MRSA has been reported in Europe, the Middle East, 
and South America (<I>279--283</I>) but is uncommon in the United States. As with any 
antibiotic, incorrect or overuse of mupirocin can result in mupirocin-resistant 
<I>Staphylococci</I>; therefore, mupirocin use should be reserved for infection control strategies only 
(<I>279,280</I>). For patients who fail mupirocin, physicians have used bacitracin, TMP-SMZ, or 
rifampin administered with another antibiotic, but no standardized protocol using these drugs 
for this indication has been evaluated and no recommendations can be made because 
of lack of data. Selection of a systemic antibiotic should be guided by susceptibility patterns.
</P><P>Intravascular cannulas or other implantable devices that are infected or 
colonized with MRSA should be removed (AIII). Patients with MRSA should be placed under 
contact precautions until all antibiotics are discontinued and until three consecutive 
cultures, taken <U>&gt;</U>1 weeks apart, are negative 
(<I>62</I>) (BIII). Screening cultures for MRSA include 
the anterior nares, any body site previously positive for MRSA, and any wounds or 
surgical sites.
</P><P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding </I>Staphylococcus
<I>Species with Reduced Susceptibility to Vancomycin</I></B>
</P><P>All HSCT centers should have sufficient laboratory capability to identify all 
<I>Staphylococci</I> isolates and their susceptibility patterns to antibiotics, including 
vancomycin (<I>284,285</I>) (AIII). Additionally, all HSCT center personnel should conduct routine 
surveillance for the emergence of 
<I>Staphylococcus</I> species strains with reduced susceptibility 
to vancomycin (<I>285,286</I>) (AIII). Reduced susceptibility should be considered for all 
<I>Sta. aureus</I> strains that have a vancomycin MIC of 
<U>&gt;</U>4 &#181;g/mL and all coagulase-negative 

<I>Staphylococci</I> that have a vancomycin MIC of 
<U>&gt;</U>8 &#181;g/mL. If repeat testing of the 
organism in pure culture confirms the genus, species, and elevated vancomycin MICs, the 
following steps should be taken (<I>287</I>):
<UL>
<LI> The laboratory should immediately contact hospital infection control 
personnel, the patient's clinical center, and the patient's attending physician, as well as 
the local or state health department, and CDC's Hospital Infections Program 
Help Desk ([404] 639-6106 or [800] 893-0485) 
(<I>284,285,287,288</I>) (AIII).
<LI> The HSCT center's infection control personnel, in collaboration with 
appropriate authorities (i.e., state and local health departments and CDC) should 
promptly initiate an epidemiologic and laboratory investigation 
(<I>287,288</I>) (AIII) and follow published guidelines for the control of such species 
(<I>285,287,288</I>) (BIII).
<LI> Medical and nursing staff should
  <ul>
    <li>institute contact precautions (e.g., wearing of gown and gloves, 
using antibacterial soap for hand washing, and wearing masks 
when contamination of the HCW with secretions is likely) as recommended 
for multidrug-resistant organisms 
(<I>62,284,287</I>);</li>
    <li>minimize the number of persons with access to colonized or 
infected patients (<I>287</I>); and</li>
    <li>treat as a cohort colonized or infected patients (e.g., care for 
them exclusively with a limited number of HCWs) 
(<I>286,287</I>) (AIII).</li>
  </ul>
<LI> If a patient in an HSCT center is colonized or infected with 
<I>Staphylococci</I> that have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, the infection control personnel 
should follow published guidelines for the control of such species 
(<I>285,287,288</I>) (BIII).
</UL>
Avoiding overuse and misuse of antibiotics will decrease the emergence 
of <I>Staphylococcus</I> species with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin 
(<I>286,287</I>). There-fore, medical and ancillary staff members who are responsible for 
monitoring antimicrobial use patterns in the facility should routinely review 
vancomycin-use patterns (<I>284,285,287</I>) (AIII). Additionally, HSCT center personnel should 
institute prudent use of all antibiotics, particularly vancomycin, to prevent the emergence 
of <I>Staphylococcus</I> with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin 
(<I>284,285,287--289</I>) (AII). Intravascular cannulas or other implantable devices that are infected or colonized 
with <I>Staphylococcus</I> species strains with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin should 
be removed (AIII).
<P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding VRE</I></B>
</P><P>Use of intravenous vancomycin is associated with VRE emergence. Vancomycin 
and all other antibiotics, particularly antianaerobic agents (e.g., metronidazole and 
third-generation cephalosporins) must be used judiciously 
(<I>284,290--292</I>) (AII). Oral van-comycin use can be limited by treating recurrences of 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> diarrhea with oral metronidazole instead of vancomycin (BIII). Physicians have placed patients with a 
history of VRE or VRE colonization into continuous isolation during clinic visits and 
hospitalizations; however, this practice is controversial because certain non-HSCT 
recipients might clear VRE from their stools. No recommendation regarding use of 
continuous 

isolation among HSCT recipients can be made because of lack of data. To control 
VRE exposure, strict adherence to the following standard infection control measures is 
necessary (<I>292</I>) (AI):
<UL>
<LI> Wash hands with antibacterial soap before entering and after leaving 
HSCT recipients' rooms, particularly those who have VRE colonization or 
infection; alternatively, wash hands with a waterless antiseptic agent (e.g., an 
alcohol-based rinse or gel) (<I>250</I>).
<LI> Whenever possible, treat as a cohort patients who are known to be colonized 
or infected with VRE (<I>290</I>).
<LI> Disinfect patient rooms and equipment 
(<I>291,293</I>), including surfaces of the hospital ward environment (e.g., floors, walls, bed frames, doors, 
bathroom surfaces) with an FDA- or EPA-registered disinfectant 
(<I>246,247</I>). A nontoxic disinfectant should be used for pediatric areas (BIII).
<LI> Place patients with VRE under contact precautions until all antibiotics 
are discontinued (CIII) and repeated cultures are negative 
(<I>62</I>) (BIII). HCWs should always wear gloves when in the VRE patient or carrier's room and discard 
gloves in the patient's room before exiting.
</UL>
No evidence exists that treating VRE carriers is beneficial; therefore, chronic 
antibiotic treatment of carriers is not recommended (DIII). HSCT recipients and candidates 
should be screened for VRE colonization at the time of interfacility transfer to allow 
for immediate institution of appropriate infection control practices and to 
minimize transmission of VRE between and within facilities 
(<I>294</I>) (BII). However, the role of outpatient surveillance in VRE control is unknown; such surveillance is costly and 
should not be undertaken in nonoutbreak settings (DIII). A history of having resolved 
VRE bacteremia or being a VRE carrier are not contraindications to HSCT (BIII).
<P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding </I>Cl. difficile</B>
</P><P>HSCT physicians should follow published recommendations for preventing and  
controlling <I>Cl. difficile</I> disease, including minimizing the duration of antibiotic therapy 
and number of antibiotics used for any indication 
(<I>295,296</I>) (AIII). All patients with <I>Cl. 
difficile</I> disease should be placed under contact precautions for the duration of illness 
(<I>62</I>) (AII). All HCWs who anticipate contact with a 
<I>Cl. difficile</I>-infected patient or the patient's 
environment or possessions should put on gloves before entering the patient's room 
(<I>62,295--298</I>) and before handling the patient's secretions and excretions (AI). During 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> outbreaks, HSCT center personnel should restrict use of antibiotics (e.g., 
clindamycin) (<I>299</I>) (BII). To prevent transmission of 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> to patients during nosocomial 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> outbreaks, HSCT center HCWs should a) use disposable rectal thermometers or 
tympanic thermometers; b) disinfect gastrointestinal endoscopes with 2% 
glutaraldehyde immersion for 10 minutes or use an equivalent disinfectant strategy 
(<I>255,256</I>); and c) perform surface sterilization of the hospital ward environment (e.g., floors, walls, 
bed frames, doors, bathroom surfaces) with an FDA- or EPA-registered sterilant (e.g., 
phosphate-buffered sodium hypochlorite solution [1,660 ppm available chloride]; 
unbuffered hypochlorite solution [500 ppm available chloride]; 0.04% formaldehyde and 0.03% 
glutaraldehyde [<I>255,295,300</I>]; or ethylene oxide 
[<I>247,296</I>]) (BII). Additionally, physicians 

should treat patients with <I>Cl. difficile</I> disease with antibiotics as recommended in 
published reports (<I>62,295</I>) (BII).
</P><P>Certain researchers also recommend antibiotic treatment of 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> carriers (<I>301</I>). However, other researchers have reported that treatment of asymptomatic 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> carriers with metronidazole is not effective and that treatment with vancomycin is 
only effective temporarily (i.e., &lt;2 months after treatment) 
(<I>302</I>). Consequently, no recommendation regarding treatment of asymptomatic 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> carriers can be made. Similarly, although symptomatic 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> disease recurrence or relapse occurs among 
7%--20% of patients (<I>295</I>), data are insufficient to make a recommendation for 
preventing multiple <I>Cl. difficile</I> relapses.
</P><P>The following practices are not recommended for 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> control:
<UL>
<LI> routine stool surveillance cultures for 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> for asymptomatic patients or HCWs, even during outbreaks (DIII);
<LI> culturing HCWs' hands for <I>Cl. 
difficile</I> (DIII); or
<LI> treating patients presumptively for 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> disease pending toxin results 
(DIII), unless the patient is very sick with a compatible syndrome or the hospital has 
a high prevalence of <I>Cl. difficile</I> (CIII).
</UL>
Prophylactic use of lyophilized <I>Saccharomyces 
boulardii</I> to reduce diarrhea among antibiotic recipients is not recommended because this therapy is not associated with 
a substantial reduction in diarrhea associated with 
<I>Cl. difficile</I> disease (<I>303</I>) and has 
been associated with <I>Saccharomyces 
boulardii</I> fungemia (<I>304</I>) (DII).
<P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding CRV Infections</I></B>
</P><P>Physicians should institute appropriate precautions and infection control 
measures for preventing nosocomial pneumonia among hospitalized HSCT recipients and 
candidates undergoing conditioning therapy, particularly during community or 
nosocomial CRV outbreaks (<I>140</I>) (AIII). Patients with URI or LRI symptoms should be placed under 
a) contact precautions for most viral respiratory infections including varicella; b) 
droplet precautions for influenza or adenovirus; or c) airborne precautions for measles or 
varicella to avoid transmitting infection to other HSCT candidates and recipients as well as 
to HCWs and visitors (BIII). Identifying HSCT recipients with RSV infection and placing 
them under contact precautions immediately (AIII) to prevent nosocomial transmission is 
critical. When suctioning the respiratory tract of patients with URI or LRI symptoms, 
HCWs should wear gowns, surgical masks, and eye protection to avoid contamination from 
the patient's respiratory secretions. All protective clothing (e.g., gown, gloves, surgical 
mask, and eye protection) should be put on when entering a patient's room and discarded in 
the same room before exiting; protective clothing should always be changed between 
patient rooms (<I>140</I>) (AIII). When caring for an HSCT recipient or candidate 
undergoing conditioning therapy with URI or LRI, HCWs and visitors should change gloves and 
wash hands a) after contact with a patient; b) after handling respiratory secretions or 
objects contaminated with secretions from one patient and before contact with another 
patient, object, or environmental surface; and c) between contacts with a contaminated body 
site and the respiratory tract of or respiratory device used on the same patient 
(<I>140</I>) (AII). This practice is critical because most respiratory infections are usually transmitted 
by contact, particularly by hand to nose and eye. Therefore just wearing a mask, 
without 

appropriate hand washing, glove-wearing, or use of eye protection is insufficient 
to prevent transmission of CRV infections.
</P><P>Researchers have proposed that HSCT recipients or candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy be placed under contact precautions during nosocomial outbreaks 
(<I>131</I>) (CIII). Even when no nosocomial or community outbreak of CRV infections exists, 
all persons who enter the HSCT center should be screened daily for URI symptoms, 
including visitors and HCWs (BIII). Researchers also describe systems where HCWs 
provide daily verification (e.g., using sign-in sheets) that they are free of URI symptoms 
before being allowed to provide HSCT patient care. HCWs and visitors with URI 
symptoms should be restricted from contact with HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy to minimize the risk for CRV transmission 
(<I>131</I>) (AIII). All HCWs with URI symptoms should be restricted from patient contact and reassigned to nonpatient 
care duties until the HCW's symptoms resolve (BIII). Visitors with URI symptoms should 
be asked to defer their visit to the HSCT center 
(<I>131</I>) until their URI symptoms resolve (BIII).
</P><P>Respiratory secretions of any hospitalized HSCT candidate or recipient with signs 
or symptoms of CRV infection should be tested promptly by viral culture and rapid 
diagnostic tests for CRV (BIII). Appropriate samples include nasopharyngeal washes, 
swabs, aspirates, throat swabs, and BAL fluid. This practice is critical because preemptive 
treatment of certain CRVs (e.g., influenza and RSV) 
(<I>133</I>) might prevent severe disease and death among HSCT recipients. Viral shedding among HSCT recipients with CRV 
infection has been reported to last <U>&lt;</U>4 months for influenza 
(<I>143</I>), <U>&lt;</U>2 years for adenovirus 
(<I>305,306</I>), and <U>&lt;</U>22 days for RSV 
(<I>136</I>); however, RSV viral shedding has been reported to last 
112 days in a child with severe combined immunodeficiency 
(<I>307</I>). Therefore, to prevent nosocomial transmission of CRV 
(<I>136</I>), HSCT center HCWs should recognize that 
prolonged CRV shedding can occur when determining the duration of appropriate 
precautions for CRV-infected HSCT recipients or candidates undergoing conditioning 
therapy (CIII). HSCT centers should use serial testing by using cultures from 
nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs or aspirates, or rapid antigen tests to help determine 
whether patients have stopped shedding influenza virus (BIII). Researchers have proposed 
that HSCT physicians conduct routine CRV surveillance among HSCT recipients to 
detect outbreaks and implement infection control measures as early as possible (CIII). 
During RSV season, HSCT recipients and candidates with signs or symptoms should be 
tested for RSV infection (i.e., the presence of RSV antigen in respiratory secretions tested 
by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and viral culture) starting with admission to 
the HSCT center. All patients who are RSV-antigen positive should be treated as a 
cohort during nosocomial RSV outbreaks because this practice  reduces nosocomial RSV 
transmission (<I>130,131</I>) (BII). Symptomatic HCWs should be excluded from patient 
contact until symptoms resolve. HCWs and visitors with infectious conjunctivitis should be 
restricted from direct patient contact until the drainage resolves (i.e., usually, 5--7 days 
for adenovirus) and the ophthalmology consultant concurs that the infection and 
inflammation have resolved (<I>268</I>) (AII) to avoid possible transmission of adenovirus to 
HSCT recipients.
</P><P>Preventing CRV exposure among HSCT recipients after hospital discharge is 
more challenging because of high CRV prevalence. Preventive measures should be 
individualized in accordance with the immunologic status and tolerance of the patient. In 
outpatient waiting rooms, patients with CRV infections should be separated to the extent 
possible 

from other patients (BIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Recommendations Regarding TB</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT candidates should be screened for TB by careful medical history and 
chart review to ascertain any history of prior TB exposure (AIII) because 
immunocompromised persons have higher risk for progression from latent TB infection to active disease 
(<I>244</I>). Also, physicians can administer a tuberculin skin test (TST) using the Mantoux 
method with five tuberculin units of purified protein derivative (CIII); but because of a 
patient's immunocompromise, this test might not be reliable. If a TST is administered, either 
the Tubersol<SUP>&#174;</SUP> or 
Aplisol<SUP>&#174;</SUP> formulation of purified protein derivative can be used 
(<I>244,308</I>). Persons with a recently positive TST or a history of a positive TST and no prior 
preventive therapy should be administered a chest radiograph and evaluated for active TB 
(<I>309</I>) (AI). For immunocompromised persons, a positive TST is defined as 
<U>&gt;</U>5 mm of induration (<I>309,310</I>) because of their decreased ability to mount a delayed hypersensitivity 
response (CIII). Because immunosuppressive therapy decreases the sensitivity of the 
TST, HSCT physicians should not rely solely on the TST to determine whether latent TB 
infection is present and whether preventive therapy should be administered to HSCT 
recipients or candidates (DIII). Instead, a full 9-month course of isonicotinic acid 
hydrazide preventive therapy should be administered to immunocompromised HSCT recipients 
or candidates who have been substantially exposed to someone with active, infectious 
(i.e., sputum-smear positive) pulmonary or laryngeal TB, regardless of the HSCT 
recipient's or candidate's TST status (<I>309</I>) (BIII). A full 9-month course of isonicotinic acid 
hydrazide preventive therapy should also be administered to HSCT recipients or candidates with 
a positive TST who were not previously treated and have no evidence of active TB 
disease (<I>309</I>) (AIII) (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Routine anergy screening might not be reliable among 
HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy and, therefore, is not 
recommended (DIII). An HSCT should not be canceled or delayed because of a positive 
TST (DIII).
</P><P>Use of a 2-month course of a daily pyrazinamide/rifampin (PZA/RIF) regimen has 
been recommended as an alternate preventive therapy for persons with TB 
(<I>309</I>). However, limited data were found regarding safety and efficacy of this regimen among 
non-HIV--infected persons. Furthermore, rifampin has substantial drug interactions with 
certain medications, including cyclosporine, tacrolimus (FK506), corticosteroids, fluconazole, 
and pain medications. Therefore, routine use of the 2-month PZA/RIF prophylactic 
regimen among HSCT recipients is not recommended (DIII). However, this regimen can be 
used for HSCT candidates who are not at risk for serious rifampin drug interactions and 
whose HSCT is not scheduled until <U>&gt;</U>2 weeks after completion of the 2-month PZA/RIF 
course (CIII). This delay will diminish the possibility of adverse effects of rifampin on drugs 
used for routine HSCT OI prophylaxis (e.g., fluconazole) 
(<I>311</I>). An HSCT candidate or recipient who has been exposed to an active case of extrapulmonary, and therefore, 
noninfectious TB does not require preventive therapy (DIII).
</P><P>HSCT center personnel should follow guidelines regarding the control of TB in 
health-care facilities (<I>244,245</I>), including instituting airborne precautions and 
negative-pressure rooms for patients with suspected or confirmed pulmonary or laryngeal TB 
(<I>62,244</I>) (AII). HCWs should wear N95 respirators, even in isolation rooms, to protect 
themselves from possible TB transmission from patients with active pulmonary or laryngeal 
TB, 

particularly during cough-inducing procedures 
(<I>62,244,245,312</I>) (AIII). To be maximally effective, respirators (e.g., N95) must be fit-tested, and all respirator users must 
be trained to use them correctly (<I>243</I>) (AIII). Unless they become soiled or damaged, 
changing N95 respirators between patient rooms is not necessary (DIII). Bacillus of 
Calmette and Gu&eacute;rin vaccination is contraindicated among HSCT candidates and recipients 
because it might cause disseminated or fatal disease among immunocompromised 
persons (<I>313,314</I>) (EII). No role has been identified for chronic suppressive therapy or 
follow-up surveillance cultures among HSCT recipients who have a history of 
successfully treated TB (DIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Infection Control Surveillance</B>
</h4><P>HSCT center personnel are advised to follow standard guidelines for surveillance 
of antimicrobial use and nosocomial pathogens and their susceptibility patterns 
(<I>315</I>) (BIII). HSCT center personnel should not perform routine fungal or bacterial cultures of 
asymptomatic HSCT recipients (<I>166,167</I>) (DII). In the absence of epidemiologic clusters of 
infections, HSCT center personnel should not perform routine periodic bacterial 
surveillance cultures of the HSCT center environment or of equipment or devices used for 
respiratory therapy, pulmonary-function testing, or delivery of inhalation anesthesia 
(<I>140</I>) (DIII). Researchers recommend that hospitals perform routine sampling of air, ceiling 
tiles, ventilation ducts, and filters to test for molds, particularly when construction or 
renovation occurs near or around the rooms of immunocompromised patients 
(<I>167,174</I>) or when clinical surveillance demonstrates a possible increase in mold (i.e., 
aspergillosis) cases (CIII). Strategies that might decrease fungal spores in the ventilation system 
include eliminating access of birds (i.e., primarily pigeons) to air-intake systems, 
removing bird droppings from the air-intake ducts, and eliminating moss from the hospital 
roof (<I>174</I>). Furthermore, in the absence of a nosocomial fungal outbreak, HSCT centers 
need not perform routine fungal cultures of devices and dust in the rooms of HSCT 
recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (DIII). HSCT center personnel 
should routinely perform surveillance for the number of aspergillosis cases occurring 
among HSCT recipients, particularly during hospital construction or renovation (BIII). A 
two-fold or greater increase in the attack rate of aspergillosis during any 6-month period 
indicates that the HSCT center environment should be evaluated for breaks in infection 
control techniques and procedures and that the ventilation system should be investigated 
carefully (<I>174</I>) (BIII).

<h4>
<B>Avoiding Environmental Exposures</B>
</h4><P>HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy, particularly 
allogeneic recipients, and parents of pediatric HSCT recipients and candidates should be 
educated regarding strategies to avoid environmental exposures to opportunistic 
pathogens (AIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Infections Transmitted by Direct Contact
</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT recipients and candidates should wash their hands thoroughly (i.e., with 
soap and water) and often. For example, hands should be washed
<UL>
<LI> before eating or preparing food;
<LI> after changing diapers;
<LI> after gardening or touching plants or dirt;
<LI> after touching pets or animals;
<LI> after touching secretions or excretions or items that might have had contact 
with human or animal stool (e.g., clothing, bedding, toilets, or bedpans);
<LI> after going outdoors; and
<LI> before and after touching wounds 
(<I>249</I>) (AIII).
</UL>
Conscientious hand washing is critical during the first 6 months after HSCT and 
during other periods of substantial immunosuppression (e.g., GVHD, systemic steroid use, 
or relapse of the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed) 
(AIII). Pediatric HSCT recipients and candidates should be supervised by adults during 
hand washing to ensure thorough cleaning 
(<I>316</I>) (BIII). Hand washing should be 
performed with an antimicrobial soap and water (AIII); alternatively, use of hygienic hand rubs is 
an acceptable means of maintaining hand hygiene 
(<I>250,251</I>). HSCT recipients who visit or live on farms should follow published recommendations for preventing 
cryptosporidiosis (<I>5,316,317--319</I>) (BIII).
<P>
<B><I>Preventing Respiratory Infections</I></B>
</P><P>To prevent respiratory infections after hospital discharge, HSCT recipients 
should observe the following precautions:
<UL>
<LI> Frequent and thorough hand washing is critical (BIII), but HSCT recipients 
should also avoid touching their mucus membranes, unless they have washed 
their hands first, to avoid inoculating themselves with CRV.
<LI> HSCT recipients should avoid close contact with persons with 
respiratory illnesses (BIII). When close contact is unavoidable, those persons with 
respiratory illnesses should be encouraged to wash their hands frequently and to 
wear surgical masks or, at a minimum, smother their sneezes and coughs in 
disposable tissues. Alternatively, the HSCT recipient can wear a surgical mask (CIII).
<LI> HSCT recipients should avoid crowded areas (e.g., shopping malls or 
public elevators) where close contact with persons with respiratory illnesses is likely
  (BIII).
<LI> HSCT candidates or recipients should be advised that certain activities 
and occupations (e.g., work in health-care settings, prisons, jails, or homeless 
shelters) can increase their risk for TB exposure (BIII). In deciding whether a patient 
should continue activities in these settings, physicians should evaluate the 
patient's specific duties, the precautions used to prevent TB exposure in the workplace, 
and the prevalence of TB in the community. The decision to continue or terminate 
such activities should be made jointly between patient and physician (BIII). 
HSCT recipients should avoid exposure to persons with active tuberculosis, 
particularly during the first 6 months after HSCT and during other periods of 
substantial immunosuppression (e.g., GVHD, systemic steroid use, or relapse of 
the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed) (BIII).
</UL>
<P>Researchers report that allogeneic recipients should avoid construction or 
excavation sites or other dust-laden environments for the first 6 months after HSCT and 
during other periods of substantial immunosuppression (e.g., GVHD, systemic steroid use, 
or relapse of the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed) to 
avoid exposures to molds (CIII). Researchers also report that outpatient HSCT recipients 
should be advised of travel routes to the HSCT center that will avoid or minimize exposure 
to construction sites (CIII).
</P><P>Coccidioidomycosis is uncommon after allogeneic HSCT; however, researchers 
report that HSCT recipients traveling to or residing in coccidioidomycosis-endemic 
areas (e.g., the American southwest, Mexico, and Central and South America) should avoid 
or minimize exposure to disturbed soil, including construction or excavation sites, 
areas with recent earthquakes, farms, or other rural areas (CIII). Histoplasmosis 
(<I>Histoplasma capsulatum</I>) after allogeneic HSCT is also rare; however, researchers report that 
HSCT recipients in histoplasmosis-endemic areas should avoid exposure to chicken coops 
and other bird-roosting sites and caves for the first 6 months after HSCT and during 
periods of substantial immunosuppression (e.g., GVHD, systemic steroid use, or relapse of 
the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed) (CIII).
</P><P>Smoking tobacco and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke are risk factors 
for bacterial and CRV infections among healthy adults and children 
(<I>320--325</I>); consequently, logic dictates that physicians advise HSCT recipients not to smoke and to avoid 
exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (CIII). However, no data were found that 
specifically assess whether smoking or environmental smoke exposure are risk factors for OIs 
among HSCT recipients. Researchers have reported that marijuana smoking might be 
associated with generation of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among 
immunocompromised persons, including HSCT recipients 
(<I>326--329</I>). Therefore, HSCT recipients should 
refrain from smoking marijuana to avoid 
<I>Aspergillus</I>species exposure 
(<I>326,330--334</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Infections Transmitted Through Direct 
Contact and Respiratory Transmission</I></B>
</P><P>Researchers have proposed that immunocompromised HSCT recipients and 
candidates who are undergoing conditioning therapy avoid gardening or direct contact 
with soil, plants, or their aerosols to reduce exposure to potential pathogens (e.g., 
<I>To. gondii</I>, <I>Hi. capsulatum</I>, <I>Cryptococcus 
neoformans</I>, <I>Nocardia</I> species, and 
<I>Aspergillus</I> species) (CIII). HSCT recipients, particularly allogeneic recipients, could wear gloves while 
gardening or touching plants or soil (<I>335</I>) (CIII), and they should avoid creating plant or 
soil aerosols (BIII). Additionally, they should always wash their hands afterwards 
(<I>335</I>) and care for skin abrasions or cuts sustained during soil or plant contact (AIII).
</P><P>Persons whose occupations involve animal contact (e.g., veterinarians, pet 
store employees, farmers, or slaughterhouse workers) could be at increased risk for 
toxoplasmosis and other zoonotic diseases. Although data are insufficient to justify a 
general 

recommendation against HSCT recipients working in such settings, these 
exposures should be avoided during the first 6 months after HSCT and during other periods 
of substantial immunosuppression (e.g., GVHD, systemic steroid use, or relapse of 
the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed) (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Safe Sex</B>
</h4><P>Sexually active HSCT recipients should avoid sexual practices that could result in 
oral exposure to feces (<I>5,316</I>) (AIII). Sexually active patients who are not in long-term 
monogamous relationships should always use latex condoms during sexual contact to 
reduce their risk for exposure to CMV, HSV, HIV, hepatitis B and C, and other 
sexually transmitted pathogens (AII). However, even long-time monogamous partners can 
be discordant for these infections. Therefore, during periods of immunocompromise, 
sexually active HSCT recipients in such relationships should consider using latex 
condoms during sexual contact to reduce the risk for exposure to these sexually 
transmitted infections (CIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Pet Safety</B>
</h4><P>
<B><I>Preventing Pet-Transmitted Zoonotic Infections</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT physicians should advise recipients and candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy of the potential infection risks posed by pet ownership; however, they should 
not routinely advise HSCT recipients to part with their pets, with limited exceptions. 
Generally, immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing 
conditioning therapy should minimize direct contact with animals 
(<I>336,337</I>), particularly those animals that are ill (e.g., with diarrhea) 
(<I>335</I>) (BIII). Immunocompromised persons who choose to own pets should be more vigilant regarding maintenance of their pet's 
health than immunocompetent pet owners (BIII). This recommendation means seeking 
veterinary care for their pet early in the pet's illness to minimize the possible transmission 
of the pet's illness to the owner (<I>335</I>) (BIII). Feeding pets only high-quality commercial 
pet foods reduces the possibility of illness caused by spoiled or contaminated foods, 
thus reducing the possibility of transmitting illness from the pet to the HSCT recipient. If 
eggs, poultry, or meat products are given to the pet as supplements, they should be 
well-cooked. Any dairy products given to pets should be pasteurized 
(<I>335</I>) (BIII). Pets should be prevented from drinking toilet bowl water and from having access to garbage; 
pets should not scavenge, hunt, or eat other animals' feces 
(<I>335</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>If HSCT recipients have contact with pets or animals, they should wash their 
hands after handling them (particularly before eating) and after cleaning cages; HSCT 
recipients should avoid contact with animal feces to reduce the risk for 
toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidiosis, salmonellosis, and campylobacteriosis 
(<I>335</I>) (BIII). Adults should supervise hand washing of pediatric HSCT recipients (BIII). Immunocompromised 
HSCT recipients and candidates should not clean pet litter boxes or cages or dispose of 
animal waste (DIII). If this cannot be avoided, patients should wear disposable gloves 
during such activities and wash their hands thoroughly afterwards (BIII). 
Immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates should avoid adopting ill or juvenile pets (e.g., aged 
&lt;6 months for cats) (<I>335</I>) and any stray animals 
(<I>5,316</I>) (BIII). Any pet that experiences diarrhea should be checked by a veterinarian for infection with 
<I>Cryptosporidium</I> (<I>5,316</I>), 
<I>Giardia</I> species (<I>335</I>), 
<I>Salmonella</I>, and <I>Campylobacter</I> 
(<I>5,335,337</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>Immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates should not have contact 
with reptiles (e.g., snakes, lizards, turtles, or iguanas) (DII) to reduce their risk for 
acquiring salmonellosis (<I>335,338--341</I>). Additionally, patients should be informed that 
salmonellosis can occur from fomite contact alone 
(<I>342</I>). Therefore, HSCT recipients and 
candidates should avoid contact with a reptile, its food, or anything that it has touched, and if 
such contact occurs, recipients and candidates should wash their hands thoroughly 
afterwards (AIII). Immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates should avoid 
contact with ducklings and chicks because of the risk for acquiring 
<I>Salmonella</I> or <I>Campylobacter</I> species infections 
(<I>338,343</I>) (BIII). Immunocompromised HSCT recipients and 
candidates should avoid contact with exotic pets (e.g., nonhuman primates) (BIII). Bird cage 
linings should be cleaned regularly (e.g., daily) 
(<I>337</I>). All persons, but particularly immunocompromised HSCT candidates and recipients, should wear gloves 
whenever handling items contaminated with bird droppings 
(<I>337</I>) (BIII) because droppings can be a source of 
<I>Cryptococcus neoformans</I>, <I>Mycobacterium 
avium</I>, or <I>Hi. capsulatum</I>. However, routine screening of healthy birds for these diseases is not recommended 
(<I>335</I>) (DIII). To minimize potential exposure to 
<I>Mycobacterium marinum</I>, immunocompromised HSCT recipients and candidates should not clean fish tanks (DIII). If this task cannot 
be avoided, patients should wear disposable gloves during such activities and wash 
their hands thoroughly afterwards (<I>335,337</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>
<B><I>Preventing Toxoplasmosis</I></B>
</P><P>The majority of toxoplasmosis cases in the United States is acquired through 
eating undercooked meat (<I>335,337</I>). However, all HSCT recipients and candidates, 
particularly those who are <I>To. gondii</I> seronegative, should be informed of the risks for 
contracting toxoplasmosis from cat feces (BIII), but need not be advised to give away their cats 
(DII). For households with cats, litter boxes should not be placed in kitchens, dining rooms, 
or other areas where food preparation and eating occur 
(<I>335</I>). Additionally, litter boxes should be cleaned daily by someone other than the HSCT recipient during the first 
6 months after HSCT and during periods of substantial immunosuppression (e.g., 
GVHD, steroid use, or relapse of the underlying disease for which the transplant was 
performed) to reduce the risk for transmitting toxoplasmosis to the HSCT recipient (BIII). Daily 
litter box changes will minimize the risk for fecal transmission of 
<I>To. gondii</I> oocysts, because fecal oocysts require 
<U>&gt;</U>2 days of incubation to become infectious. If HSCT 
recipients perform this task during the first 6 months after HSCT and during subsequent periods 
of substantial immunocompromise (e.g., during GVHD, systemic steroid use, or relapse 
of the underlying neoplastic disease for which the transplant was performed), they 
should wear disposable gloves (<I>335</I>). Gloves should be discarded after a single use (BIII). 
Soiled, dried litter should be disposed of carefully to prevent aerosolizing the 
<I>To. gondii</I> oocysts (BIII). Cat feces (but not litter) can be flushed down the toilet (BIII). Also, persons who 
clean cat litter, particularly HSCT recipients, should wash their hands thoroughly with soap 
and water afterwards to reduce their risk for acquiring toxoplasmosis (BIII).
</P><P>HSCT recipients and candidates with cats should keep their cats inside (BIII) 
and should not adopt or handle stray cats (DIII). Cats should be fed only canned or 
dried commercial food or well-cooked table food, not raw or undercooked meats, to 
eliminate the possibility of causing an illness that could be transmitted from the cat to the 
HSCT recipient (BIII). Pet cats of HSCT recipients do not need to be tested for 
toxo-plasmosis (EII). Playground sandboxes should be kept covered when not in use to prevent cats 
from 

soiling them (BIII). HSCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning 
therapy should avoid drinking raw goat's milk to decrease the risk for acquiring 
toxoplasmosis (BIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Water and Other Beverage Safety</B>
</h4><P>Although limited data were found regarding the risks for and epidemiology 
of <I>Cryptosporidium</I> disease among HSCT recipients, HSCT recipients are prudent to 
avoid possible exposures to <I>Cryptosporidium</I> (BIII) because it has been reported to 
cause severe, chronic diarrhea, malnutrition, and death among other 
immunocompromised persons (<I>5,318,319</I>). HSCT recipients should avoid walking, wading, swimming, or 
playing in recreational water (e.g., ponds or lakes) that is likely to be contaminated 
with <I>Cryptosporidium</I>, <I>Es. coli</I> O157:H7 
(<I>344--346</I>), sewage, or animal or human waste 
(BII). HSCT recipients should also avoid swallowing such water (e.g., while 
swimming) (<I>5,344,346</I>) as well as any water taken directly from rivers and lakes 
(<I>5,316</I>) (AIII).
</P><P>HSCT recipients should not use well water from private wells or from public wells 
in communities with limited populations (DIII) because tests for microbial 
contamination are performed too infrequently (e.g., in certain locations, tests are performed 
<U>&lt;</U>1 times/month) to detect sporadic bacterial contamination. However, drinking well water 
from municipal wells serving highly populated areas is regarded as safe from bacterial 
contamination because the water is tested 
<U>&gt;</U>2 times/day for bacterial contamination. If 
HSCT recipients consume tap water, they should routinely monitor mass media (e.g., 
radio, television, or newspapers) in their area to immediately implement any boil-water 
advisories that might be issued for immunocompromised persons by state or local 
governments (BIII). A boil-water advisory means that all tap water should be boiled for 
<U>&gt;</U>1 minutes before it is consumed. Tap water might not be completely free 
of <I>Cryptosporidium</I>. To eliminate the risk for 
<I>Cryptosporidium</I> exposure from tap water, HSCT recipients can boil tap water for 
<U>&gt;</U>1 minutes before consuming it (e.g., drinking 
or brushing teeth) (<I>5</I>) (CIII). Alternately, they can use certain types of water filters 
(<I>316</I>) or a home distiller (<I>317</I>) to reduce their risk for 
<I>Cryptosporidium</I> (<I>5</I>) and other 
waterborne pathogens (CIII). If a home water filter******* is used, it should be capable of 
removing particles <U>&gt;</U>1 &#181;m in diameter, or filter by reverse osmosis. However, the majority of 
these filters are not capable of removing smaller microbes (e.g., bacteria or viruses), 
and therefore, should only be used on properly treated municipal water. Further, the 
majority of these devices would not be appropriate for use on an unchlorinated private well 
to control viral or bacterial pathogens. Bottled water can be consumed if it has been 
processed to remove <I>Cryptosporidium</I> by one of three processes --- reverse osmosis, 
distillation, or 1-&#181;m particulate absolute filtration. To confirm that a specific bottled water 
has undergone one of these processes, HSCT recipients should contact the bottler 
directly.******** Patients can take other precautions in the absence of boil-water 
advisories to further reduce their risk for cryptosporidiosis. These extra precautions 
include 

avoiding fountain beverages and ice made from tap water at restaurants, bars, 
and theaters (<I>5</I>), fruit drinks made from frozen concentrate mixed with tap water, and iced 
tea or coffee made with tap water (<I>317</I>). Drinks that are likely to be 
<I>Cryptosporidium</I> safe for HSCT recipients include nationally distributed brands of bottled or canned 
carbonated soft drinks and beers (<I>5</I>); commercially packaged noncarbonated drinks that contain 
fruit juice; fruit juices that do not require refrigeration until after opening (e.g., those that 
are stored unrefrigerated on grocery shelves) 
(<I>5</I>); canned or bottled soda, seltzer or 
fruit drinks; steaming hot (<U>&gt;</U>175 F) tea or coffee 
(<I>317</I>); juices labeled as pasteurized; and nationally distributed brands of frozen fruit juice concentrate that are reconstituted 
with water from a safe source (<I>5</I>). HSCT recipients should not drink unpasteurized milk or 
fruit or vegetable juices (e.g., apple cider or orange juice) to avoid infection with 
<I>Brucella</I> species, <I>Es. coli</I> O157:H7, 
<I>Salmonella</I> species, <I>Cryptosporidium</I>, and others 
(<I>319,347--351</I>) (DII).
</P><h4>
<B>Food Safety</B>
</h4><P>HSCT candidates and household or family members who prepare food for them 
after HSCT should review food safety practices that are appropriate for all persons 
(<I>352</I>) (AIII), and food preparers should be educated regarding additional food safety practices 
appropriate for HSCT recipients. This review and education should be done before the 
conditioning regimen (i.e., chemotherapy and radiation) begins (BIII). Adherence to these 
guidelines will decrease the risk for foodborne disease among HSCT recipients.
</P><P>
<B><I>Food Safety Practices Appropriate for All Persons</I></B>
</P><P>Raw poultry, meats, fish, and seafood should be handled on separate surfaces 
(e.g., cutting board or counter top) from other food items. Food preparers should always 
use separate cutting boards (i.e., one for poultry and other meats and one for vegetables 
and remaining cutting or carving tasks) (AIII), or the board(s) should be washed with 
warm water and soap between cutting different food items (AIII). To prevent foodborne 
illnesses caused by <I>Campylobacter jejuni</I> and 
<I>Salmonella enteritidis</I>, which can cause severe and invasive infections among immunocompromised persons 
(<I>353,354</I>), uncooked meats should not come in contact with other foods (BIII).
</P><P>After preparing raw poultry, meats, fish, and seafood and before preparing 
other foods, food handlers should wash their hands thoroughly in warm, soapy water. 
Any cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils used should be washed thoroughly 
in warm, soapy water also (AIII). Food preparers should keep shelves, counter tops, 
refrigerators, freezers, utensils, sponges, towels, and other kitchen items clean (AIII). All 
fresh produce should be washed thoroughly under running water before serving 
(<I>355</I>) (AIII). Persons preparing food should follow published U.S. Department of Agriculture 
recommendations regarding safe food thawing 
(<I>356</I>) (BIII).
</P><P>Persons cooking food for HSCT recipients should follow established guidelines 
for monitoring internal cooking temperatures for meats 
(<I>357</I>) (AII). The only method for determining whether the meat has been adequately cooked is to measure its 
internal temperature with a thermometer because the color of the meat after cooking does 
not reliably reflect the internal temperature. Different kinds of meat should be cooked 
to varying internal temperatures, all <U>&gt;</U>150 F (AII). Specifically, the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture recommends that poultry be cooked to an internal temperature of 180 F; 
other meats and egg-containing casseroles and souffles should be cooked to an internal 
tem

perature of <U>&gt;</U>160 F. Cold foods should be stored at &lt;40 F; hot foods should be kept at 
&gt;140 F (BIII). Food preparers should
<UL>
<LI> wash their hands before and after handling leftovers (AIII);
<LI> use clean utensils and food-preparation surfaces (AIII);
<LI> divide leftovers into small units and store in shallow containers for quick 
cooling (AII);
<LI> refrigerate leftovers within 2 hours of cooking (AII).
<LI> discard leftovers that were kept at room temperature for &gt;2 hours (AIII);
<LI> reheat leftovers or heat partially cooked foods to 
<U>&gt;</U>165 F throughout before serving (AII);
<LI> bring leftover soups, sauces, and gravies to a rolling boil before serving (AIII); and
<LI> follow published guidelines for cold storage of food 
(<I>352</I>) (AII).
</UL>
<P>
<B><I>Additional Food Safety Practices Appropriate for 
HSCT Recipients</I></B>
</P><P>HSCT recipients' diets should be restricted to decrease the risk for exposure 
to foodborne infections from bacteria, yeasts, molds, viruses, and parasites (BIII). 
Currently, a low microbial diet is recommended for HSCT recipients 
(<I>358,359</I>) (BIII). This diet should be continued for 3 months after HSCT for autologous recipients. Allogeneic 
recipients should remain on the diet until all immunosuppressive drugs (e.g., cyclosporine, 
steroids, and tacrolimus) are discontinued. However, the HSCT physician should have final 
responsibility for determining when the diet can be discontinued safely. Only one study 
has reported that dietary changes (e.g., consuming yogurt) have decreased the risk for 
mycotic infections (e.g., candidal vaginitis) 
(<I>360</I>) (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>). HSCT recipients should not 
eat any raw or undercooked meat, including beef, poultry, pork, lamb, venison or other 
wild game, or combination dishes containing raw or undercooked meats or 
sweetbreads from these animals (e.g., sausages or casseroles) (AII). Also, HSCT recipients should 
not consume raw or undercooked eggs or foods that might contain them (e.g., certain 
preparations of hollandaise sauce, Caesar and other salad dressings, homemade 
mayonnaise, and homemade eggnog) because of the risk for infection with 
<I>Salmonella enteritidis</I> (<I>354</I>) (AII). HSCT recipients should not consume raw or undercooked seafood (e.g., 
oysters or clams) to prevent exposure to 
<I>Vibrio</I> species, viral gastroenteritis, and 
<I>Cryptosporidium parvum</I> (<I>361--364</I>) (AII).
</P><P>HSCT recipients and candidates should only consume meat that is welldone 
when they or their caretakers do not have direct control over food preparation (e.g., 
when eating in a restaurant) (AI). To date, no evidence exists in the United States that 
eating food at a fast food restaurant is riskier than eating at a conventional sit-down 
restaurant. Generally, HSCT candidates undergoing conditioning therapy and HSCT recipients 
with neutropenia (i.e., ANC &lt; 
1,000/ml<SUP>3</SUP>), GVHD, or immunosuppression should avoid 
exposures to naturopathic medicines that might contain molds 
(<I>365</I>) (DIII). HSCT recipients wishing to take naturopathic medications are advised to use them only as prescribed 
by a licensed naturopathic physician working in consultation with the recipient's 
transplant 

and infectious disease physicians (CIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Travel Safety</B>
</h4><P>Travel to developing countries can pose substantial risks for exposure to 
opportunistic pathogens for HSCT recipients, particularly allogeneic recipients chronically 
immunosuppressed. HSCT recipients should not plan travel to developing countries without 
consulting their physicians (AIII), and travel should not occur until the period of severe 
immunosuppression has resolved. Generally, allogeneic recipients should not plan travel 
to developing countries for 6--12 months after HSCT, particularly if GVHD has 
occurred. Autologous recipients can travel to developing countries 3--6 months after HSCT if 
their physicians agree.
</P><P>HSCT recipients should be informed regarding strategies to minimize the risk 
for acquiring foodborne and waterborne infections while traveling. They should obtain 
updated, detailed health information for international travelers from health 
organizations (<I>366,367</I>) (AIII). Generally, while traveling in developing countries, HSCT recipients 
should avoid consuming the following (BIII):
<UL>
<LI> raw fruits and vegetables,
<LI> tap water or any potentially untreated or contaminated water,
<LI> ice made from tap water or any potentially contaminated water,
<LI> unpasteurized milk or any unpasteurized dairy products,
<LI> fresh fruit juices,
<LI> food and drinks from street vendors, and
<LI> raw or undercooked eggs.
</UL>
Steaming hot foods, fruits peeled by oneself, bottled and canned processed drinks, 
and hot coffee or tea are probably safe 
(<I>367,368</I>). Travelers should plan for treating 
their drinking water while in developing countries. If bottled water is not available, boiling 
is the best method of making water safe. However, if boiling water is not feasible, 
the traveler should carry supplies for disinfecting water (e.g., commercially available 
iodine disinfection tablets or a portable water filter) 
(<I>366,368</I>).
<P>Antimicrobial prophylaxis for traveler's diarrhea is not recommended routinely 
for HSCT recipients traveling to developing countries (DIII) because traveler's diarrhea is 
not known to be more frequent or more severe among immunocompromised hosts. 
However, HSCT physicians who wish to provide prophylaxis to HSCT recipients who 
are traveling can prescribe a fluoroquinolone (e.g., ciprofloxacin hydrochloride) or 
TMP-SMZ (CIII), although resistance to TMP-SMZ is now common and resistance to 
fluoroquinolones is increasing in tropical areas (<a href="rr4910a1.htm#appx">Appendix</a>). Researchers recommend using 
bismuth subsalicylate to prevent traveler's diarrhea among adults 
(<I>366</I>). However, no data were found regarding safety and efficacy among HSCT recipients, and salicylates are 
not recommended for use among persons aged &lt;18 years because salicylates are 
associated with Reye's syndrome (<I>369</I>).
</P><P>HSCT recipients' immunization status should be assessed and their vaccinations 
updated as needed before travel (<I>366</I>). Influenza chemoprophylaxis with rimantadine 
or amantadine can be used for immunocompromised HSCT recipients who are 
traveling 

outside the continental United States and who could be exposed to influenza A (CIII).
<H3>
<B>HSCT RECIPIENT VACCINATIONS</B>
</H3>
<P>Antibody titers to vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., tetanus, polio, measles, 
mumps, rubella, and encapsulated organisms) decline during the 1--4 years after allogeneic 
or autologous HSCT (<I>66,370--373</I>) if the recipient is not revaccinated. Clinical relevance 
of decreased antibodies to vaccine-preventable diseases among HSCT recipients is 
not immediately apparent because a limited number of cases of vaccine-preventable 
diseases are reported among U.S. recipients. However, vaccine-preventable diseases 
still pose risks to the U.S. population. Additionally, evidence exists that certain 
vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., encapsulated organisms) can pose increased risk for HSCT 
recipients (<I>66</I>); therefore, HSCT recipients should be routinely revaccinated after HSCT 
so that they can experience immunity to the same vaccine-preventable diseases as 
others (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>).
</P><P>HSCT center personnel have developed vaccination schedules for HSCT 
recipients (<I>374</I>). One study determined that HSCT center personnel used 3--11 different 
vaccination schedules per vaccine (<I>374</I>); consequently, the study authors requested 
national guidelines for doses and timing of vaccines after HSCT to eliminate confusion 
among HSCT center personnel regarding how to vaccinate their patients. To address this 
need, an interim vaccination schedule for HSCT recipients was drafted in collaboration 
with partner organizations, including CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices. The purpose of the vaccination schedule in these guidelines is to provide guidance 
for HSCT centers (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>). Although limited data were found regarding safety and 
immunogenicity (e.g., serologic studies of antibody titers after vaccination) among HSCT 
recipients, no data were found regarding vaccine efficacy among HSCT recipients (e.g., 
which determine whether vaccinated HSCT recipients have decreased attack rates of 
disease compared with unvaccinated HSCT recipients). Because certain HSCT recipients 
have faster immune system recovery after HSCT than others, researchers have 
proposed that different vaccination schedules be recommended for recipients of different types 
of HSCT. However, to date, data are too limited to do so. Therefore, the same 
vaccination schedule is recommended for all HSCT recipients (e.g., allogeneic, autologous, and 
bone marrow, peripheral, or UCB grafts) until additional data are published. In the 
tables, vaccines have only been recommended for use among HSCT recipients if 
evidence exists of safety and immunogenicity for those recipients. Vaccination of family 
members, household contacts, and HCWs are also recommended to minimize exposure of 
vaccine-preventable diseases among HSCT recipients (<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab5">Tables 5</a>--<a href = "rr4910a1.htm#tab8">8</a>).
<H3>
<B>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL SAFETY</B>
</H3>
<P>With allogeneic HSCT, the life of the recipient might depend on the timely selection 
of an acceptable HLA-matched donor. Only a limited number of HLA-matched donors 
might 

be identified; hence, the transplant physician often has to accept a higher risk for 
transmission of an infectious agent through HSCT than would be permitted for routine 
blood transfusion. This section provides strategies for the HSCT physician to minimize 
transmission of infectious diseases, whenever possible, from donors to 
recipients.********* ********** Whether to select a donor who is at risk for or who has an 
infectious disease transmissible by HSCT, should be determined on a case-by-case basis (AIII) 
and is the final responsibility of the HSCT physician (AIII). If the only possible donor is at 
risk for or known to be infected with a bloodborne pathogen and the patient is likely 
to succumb rapidly from his or her disease if an HSCT is not received, the physician 
must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using potentially infected donor cells. No 
person should be denied a potentially life-saving HSCT procedure solely on the basis of the 
risk for an infectious disease. However, HSCT physicians should avoid transplanting 
any infected or infectious donor hematopoietic stem cell product unless no other stem 
cell product can be obtained and the risk for death from not undergoing transplantation 
is deemed to be greater than the risk for morbidity or death from the infection that 
could potentially be transmitted (DII). If such a product is selected for use, it should be done 
on a case-by-case basis (<I>375</I>) and the following should be noted in the recipient's chart:
<UL>
<LI> knowledge and authorization of the recipient's HSCT physician regarding 
the potential for transmission of an infectious agent during HSCT, and
<LI> advance informed consent from the recipient or recipient's legal 
guardian acknowledging the possible transmission of an infectious agent during 
the transplantation (AIII).
</UL>
Subsequently, the HSCT physician should include the infectious agent in the 
differential diagnosis of any illness that the HSCT recipient experiences so that the infection, 
if transmitted, can be diagnosed early and treated preemptively, if possible. 
Infectious products (except those in which CMV seropositivity is the only evidence 
of infectiousness) should be labeled as being a biohazard or as untested for biohazards, 
as applicable. Tissue intended for autologous use should be labeled &quot;For Autologous 
Use Only --- Use Only for (Patient's Name).&quot;
<h4>
<B>Preventing Transmission of Infections 
from HSCT Donors to Recipients</B>
</h4><P>All prospective HSCT donors should be evaluated through a physical history 
and examination to determine their general state of health and whether they pose a risk 
for transmitting infectious diseases to the recipient 
(<I>376</I>). To detect transmissible infections, all HSCT donor collection site personnel should follow up-to-date published 
guidelines and standards for donor screening (e.g., medical history), physical exam, and 
serologic testing (<I>377--383</I>) (AIII). Initial donor screening and physical exam should be 
performed <U>&lt;</U>8 weeks before the planned donation (BIII). Donor serologic testing should be 
done <U>&lt;</U>30 days before donation to detect potentially transmissible infections (BII); additionally, 
researchers recommend that donors be retested 
<U>&lt;</U>7 days before collection. If testing is done &gt;7 days before donation, donor screening should be repeated to ensure that 
no new risk behaviors have occurred during the interval between the original screening 
and the time of donation (BIII). This practice is critical because if new behavioral risk 
factors have occurred, the potential donor might need to be deferred. Screening and 
testing 

should be done on all allogeneic or syngeneic donors (AIII). Screening and testing 
of autologous donors is recommended to ensure the safety of laboratory personnel and 
to prevent cross contamination (BIII). If autologous donors are not tested, their 
autologous units should be specially labeled and handled as if potentially infected (BIII). For 
donors screened in the United States, FDA-licensed or -approved tests should be used in 
accordance with the manufacturers' instructions (AIII), and the donor samples should be 
tested in laboratories certified by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 
1988 (AIII).
</P><P>All HSCT donors should be in good general health 
(<I>376</I>) (BIII). Acute or chronic illness in the prospective donor should be investigated to determine the etiology. 
Generally, persons who are ill should not be HSCT donors (DIII). A flu-like illness in a 
prospective donor at the time of evaluation or between the time of evaluation and donation 
should prompt evaluation of and serologic testing for infections that might pose a risk to 
the recipient (e.g., EBV, CMV, <I>To. gondii</I>) (BIII). Persons with a positive serum EBV-viral 
capsid antigen IgM but negative serum EBV-viral capsid antigen IgG should not serve as 
donors for allogeneic T-cell--depleted HSCT, particularly for unrelated or mismatched 
transplants, until their serum EBV-viral capsid antigen IgG becomes positive (DIII). 
Persons with acute toxoplasmosis should not donate until the acute illness has resolved 
(DII); however, physicians should be aware that persons who are asymptomatically 
seropositive for <I>To. gondii</I> might transmit this infection through HSCT 
(<I>218</I>).
</P><P>Prospective donors with symptoms of active TB should be evaluated for that 
disease (<I>383</I>) (BIII). Prospective donors with active TB should not donate (EIII) until the TB is 
well-controlled (e.g., no longer contagious as determined by the donor's primary 
physician) after appropriate medical therapy. However, no known risk exists from 
transplanting marrow from an untreated, tuberculin-positive donor who has no evidence of 
active disease. Screening potential donors for TB with Mantoux skin tests (DIII) is not 
necessary. Prospective HSCT donors who reside in or have traveled to areas endemic for 
rickettsia or other tickborne pathogens and who are suspected of having an acute tickborne 
infection should be temporarily deferred as donors until infection with these pathogens 
is excluded (DIII). Relevant pathogens include <I>Rickettsia 
rickettsii</I>, <I>Babesia microti</I> and other 
<I>Babesia</I> species, <I>Coxiella burnetii</I>, and the Colorado tick fever virus, which are 
the etiologic agents of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, babesiosis, Q fever, and Colorado 
tick fever, respectively; these pathogens have been reported to be transmitted by 
blood transfusion (<I>384--388</I>). Researchers recommend deferral for a past history of Q fever 
or babesiosis because these infections can be chronic and the babesiosis parasite 
might persist despite appropriate therapy 
(<I>389</I>) (CIII). Additionally, researchers have 
recommended deferring persons with acute human ehrlichiosis (e.g., human active 
human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [<I>390</I>], human monocytic ehrlichiosis, as well as any 
infections from <I>Ehrlichia ewingii</I>) from HSCT donation (CIII).
</P><P>The medical history of the prospective HSCT donor should include the following:
<UL>
<LI> History of vaccinations 
(<I>377</I>) during the 4 weeks before donation (AII). If 
the potential donor is unsure of vaccinations received, his or her records should 
be reviewed. HSCT donation should be deferred for 4 weeks after the donor 
receives any live-attenuated vaccine (e.g., rubeola [measles], mumps, rubella 
[German measles], oral polio, varicella, yellow fever, and oral typhoid vaccines) (EIII). 
This deferral will avoid the possibility of infusing a live infectious agent into an 
HSCT recipient. HSCT donation need not be deferred for persons who have 
recently received toxoid or killed (i.e., inactivated), recombinant viral, bacterial, 
or rickettsial vaccines as long as the donor is asymptomatic and afebrile 
(<I>389</I>) (BIII). Such vaccines include tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, hepatitis A and 
B, cholera, influenza (i.e., killed intramuscular vaccine), meningococcal, 
paratyphoid, pertussis, plague, polio (i.e., inactivated polio vaccine), rabies, typhoid 
(i.e., inactivated intramuscular vaccine), or typhus vaccines 
(<I>389</I>).
<LI> Travel history (BIII) to determine whether the donor has ever resided in 
or traveled to countries with endemic diseases that might be transmitted 
through HSCT (e.g., malaria). Permanent residents of nonendemic countries who 
have traveled to an area that CDC regards as endemic for malaria can be accepted 
as HSCT donors if 1 year has elapsed since the donor's departure from the 
endemic area and if the donor has been free of malaria symptoms, regardless of 
whether he or she received antimalarial chemoprophylaxis. Because cases of 
HSCT-transmitted malaria have been reported 
(<I>391,392</I>), persons who have had malaria and received appropriate treatment should be deferred from 
HSCT donation for 3 years after becoming asymptomatic. Immigrants, 
refugees, citizens, or residents for <U>&gt;</U>5 years of endemic countries can be accepted as 
HSCT donors if 3 years have elapsed since they departed the malarious area and if 
they have been free of malaria symptoms.
<LI> History of Chagas' disease and leishmaniasis. Persons with active 
Chagas' disease or leishmaniasis should not serve as HSCT donors (DIII) because 
these diseases can be transmitted by transfusion 
(<I>227,229,231,393--395</I>). Researchers also recommend deferral of HSCT donation if a past history exists of either 
of these diseases because the parasite can persist despite therapy 
(<I>227--229,231, 389,393--395</I>) (CIII).
<LI> History of any deferral from plasma or blood donation. The reason for such 
a deferral (<I>376</I>) and whether it was based on a reported infectious disease 
or behavioral or other risk factor should be investigated (BIII).
<LI> History of viral hepatitis. A person with a history of viral hepatitis after his or 
her eleventh birthday should be excluded from HSCT donation (BIII).
<LI> History of blood product transfusion, solid organ transplantation, or 
transplantation of tissue within the last 12 months (BIII). Such persons should be 
excluded from HSCT donation (DIII). Xenotransplant product recipients and their 
close contacts should be indefinitely deferred from donating any blood 
products, including hematopoietic stem cells, whole blood, or other blood 
components including plasma, leukocytes, and tissues 
(<I>396</I>) (AIII). Close contacts to be deferred from donations include persons who have engaged repeatedly 
in activities that could result in an intimate exchange of body fluids with 
a xenotransplantation product recipient. Such close contacts could include 
sexual partners, household members who share razors or toothbrushes, and HCWs 
or laboratory personnel with repeated percutaneous, mucosal, or other 
direct exposures.
<LI> History of risk factors for classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), including 
any blood relative with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, receipt of a human 
pituitary-derived growth hormone or receipt of a corneal or dura mater graft 
(<I>383,397--399</I>) (BIII). Potential HSCT donors should also be screened for new 
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD) risk factors, including a history of 
cumulative travel or residence in the United Kingdom for 
<U>&gt;</U>6 months during 1980--1996 or receipt of injectable bovine insulin since 1980, unless the product was 
not manufactured since 1980 from cattle in the United Kingdom 
(<I>398</I>) (BIII). The clinical latency period for iatrogenic, classic CJD can be &gt;30 years 
(<I>398</I>), and transmission of classic CJD by blood products is highly unlikely 
(<I>398</I>). Although no classic or nvCJD has ever been reported among HSCT recipients, persons with 
a history of classic or nvCJD risk factors should be excluded from donation 
for unrelated HSCT (DIII) if a choice exists between two otherwise equally 
suitable donors. The risk for transmitting classic or nvCJD from an HSCT donor to 
a recipient is unknown, but researchers believe that persons with nvCJD 
risk factors could be at higher risk for transmitting nvCJD to HSCT recipients 
than persons with classic CJD risk factors.
<LI> Past medical history that indicates the donor has clinical evidence of or is at 
high risk for acquiring a bloodborne infection (e.g., HIV-1 or -2, human 
T-lymphotropic virus [HTLV]-I or -II, hepatitis C, or hepatitis B) 
(<I>381,383</I>), including
  <ul>
    <li>men who have had sex with another man during the preceding 5 
years (<I>381,383</I>) (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons who report nonmedical intravenous, intramuscular, or 
subcutaneous injection of drugs during the preceding 5 years 
(<I>381</I>) (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons with hemophilia or related clotting disorders who have 
received human-derived clotting factor concentrates 
(<I>381</I>) (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons who have engaged in sex in exchange for money or drugs 
during the preceding 5 years (<I>381</I>) (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons who have had sex during the preceding 12 months with 
any person described previously (<I>381</I>) or with a person known or suspected 
to have HIV (<I>381</I>) or hepatitis B infections (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons who have been exposed during the preceding 12 months to 
known or suspected HIV, hepatitis B- or C-infected blood through 
percutaneous inoculation or through contact with an open wound, nonintact skin, 
or mucous membrane (<I>381</I>) (BIII);</li>
    <li>inmates of correctional systems 
(<I>379--381</I>) and persons who have been incarcerated for &gt;72 consecutive hours during the previous 12 
months (BIII);</li>
    <li>persons who have had or have been treated for syphilis or 
gonorrhea during the preceding 12 months 
(<I>376,379,380</I>) (BIII); and</li>
    <li>persons who within 12 months have undergone tattooing, acupuncture, 
ear or body piercing (<I>380,400,401</I>) in which shared instruments are known 
to have been used (BIII) or other nonsterile conditions existed.</li>
  </ul>
</UL>
Persons reporting any of these past medical histories should be excluded from 
donation (DIII).
<P>The following serologic tests should be performed for each prospective donor:
<UL>
<LI> HIV-1 antigen, anti-HIV-1 and -2, anti-HTLV-I and -II, hepatitis B surface 
antigen, total antihepatitis B core antigen, antihepatitis C, anti-CMV, and a serologic test 
for syphilis (<I>376,379,380,383</I>) (AIII). Potential donors who have repeatedly 
reactive screening tests for HIV-1 antigen, anti-HIV-1 or -2, anti-HTLV-I or -II, 
antihepatitis C, hepatitis B surface antigen, or antihepatitis B core antigen should be 
excluded as HSCT donors (<I>381</I>) (EII). Persons who refuse infectious disease testing 
should also be excluded as HSCT donors (<I>381</I>) (EIII).
<LI> Investigational nucleic acid tests to detect hepatitis C virus RNA and HIV RNA 
are currently being used in the United States to screen blood donors and could 
be used for screening HSCT donors. If nucleic acid tests are approved by FDA, 
these tests should be incorporated into routine screening regimens for HSCT 
donors. When nucleic acid testing is done for HIV and hepatitis C investigationally, 
a positive result should exclude the potential donor.
</UL>
All infectious disease testing and results should be reported to the HSCT 
physician before the candidate's conditioning regimen begins 
(<I>381</I>) (AIII). Bone marrow should be collected using sterile technique in a medically acceptable setting and according 
to standard operating procedures (AIII).
<P>HSCT transplant center personnel should keep accurate records of all HSCT 
received and the disposition of each sample obtained 
(<I>381</I>). These tracking records must be separate from patients' medical records (e.g., in a log book) so that this information is 
easily obtainable. Recorded information should include the donor identification number, 
name of procurement of distribution center supplying the HSCT, recipient-identifying 
information, name of recipient's physician, and dates of a) receipt by the HSCT center and 
b) either transplantation to the recipient or further distribution 
(<I>381</I>) (AIII). All centers for donation, transplantation, or collection of hematopoietic stem cells should keep 
records of donor screening and testing, and HSCT harvesting, processing, 
testing, cryopreservation, storage, and infusion or disposal of each aliquot of donated 
hematopoietic progenitor cells for <U>&gt;</U>10 years after the date of implantation, 
transplantation, infusion, or transfer of the product 
(<I>378</I>) (AIII). However, if that date is not known, 
records should be retained <U>&gt;</U>10 years after the product's distribution, disposition, or 
expiration, whichever is latest.
</P><h4>
<B>Pediatric Donors</B>
</h4><P>Children aged &gt;18 months who are born to mothers with or at risk for HIV 
infection, who have not been breast-fed during the past 12 months, and whose HIV antibody 
tests, physical examination, and medical records do not indicate evidence of HIV infection 
can be accepted as donors (<I>381</I>) (BIII). Children aged &lt;18 months who are born to 
mothers with or at risk for HIV infection and who have not been breast-fed by an 
HIV-infected woman during the past 12 months can be accepted as donors only if HIV infection 
has been excluded according to established criteria 
(<I>402</I>) (BIII). Children who have been breast-fed by an HIV-infected woman during the past 12 months should be excluded 
as 

stem cell donors regardless of HIV infection status (AIII). The mother and, if possible, 
the father of all pediatric stem-cell donors who are at risk for perinatal transmission of 
HIV and other bloodborne infections, should be interviewed by a health-care 
professional competent to elicit information regarding risk factors for possible bloodborne infection 
in the potential pediatric donor (AIII). Children who meet any of the adult donor 
exclusion criteria should not become HSCT donors 
(<I>381</I>) (EIII).
</P><h4>
<B>Preventing Infection from Extraneous 
Contamination of Donated Units</B>
</h4><P>Personnel of donation, collection, or transplantation centers, cell-processing 
laboratories, and courier services should follow current standards for detecting and 
preventing extrinsic bacterial and fungal contamination of collected stem cell units at the 
collection site, during processing and transportation, and at the transplant center 
(<I>376</I>) (AIII). Quality improvement programs and procedure manuals of collection centers, 
cell-processing laboratories, and transplant programs should include strategies for preventing 
transplant-associated infections. For example, collection centers should use aseptic 
techniques when collecting marrow, peripheral blood, and UCB hematopoietic stem 
cells (<I>376,378</I>) (AIII). Whenever possible, closed systems should be used for pooling 
hematopoietic stem cells during a collection procedure (BIII) because higher rates of 
microbial contamination seen in marrow harvests versus blood stem cell collections can be 
caused by use of open collecting systems 
(<I>375,403,404</I>). The highest risk for extraneous 
microbial contamination of hematopoietic stem cells occurs during extensive 
manipulation and processing in the laboratory 
(<I>404,405</I>). Potential sources include unprotected 
hands and laboratory equipment and freezers 
(<I>406</I>), particularly the liquid phases of 
liquid nitrogen freezers (<I>407</I>). Therefore, stem cell processing should be performed 
according to current standards (<I>378</I>) using approved manufacturing practices (AIII). 
Hematopoietic stem cell units thawed in a water bath should be enclosed in a second bag (i.e., 
double-bagged technique) to prevent contamination of the ports or caps from unsterile 
bath water (<I>407</I>) (BIII). Additionally, water baths should be cleaned routinely (BIII) and 
certain researchers have proposed that the bath contain sterile water 
(<I>407</I>) (CIII). Researchers also report sterilizing liquid nitrogen freezers before initial use for hematopoietic 
stem cell storage (<I>407</I>) until fungal and bacterial cultures are negative (CIII).
</P><P>Cell-processing laboratory personnel should implement programs to detect 
extrinsic bacterial or fungal contamination of collected stem cell units, ideally before 
transplantation (AIII). Although repeated cultures are costly 
(<I>408</I>), donated hematopoietic stem cells should be cultured for aerobic bacteria and fungi 
<U>&gt;</U>1 times during initial processing and freezing (BIII). Researchers also have proposed adding anaerobic bacterial cultures 
and culturing twice, once at the end of processing, and once after thawing just before 
use (<I>407</I>) (CIII). If bacterial culture results are positive, antibiotic-susceptibility tests should 
be performed (BIII). Results of cultures and antibiotic-susceptibility tests should be 
provided to the transplant physician before release of a cryopreserved marrow or blood stem 
cell unit, and as soon as feasible for transplants infused before completion of culture 
incubation (BIII).
</P><P>Collection center, cell-processing laboratory, and transplant program personnel 
should maintain active surveillance of infections among persons who have received 
hematopoietic stem cells from those facilities to collect data regarding the number of infections 
after 

HSCT that might have been caused by exogenous contamination of donor stem 
cells (BIII) because this type of infection has been reported 
(<I>405</I>).
</P><h4>
<B>In Utero or Fetal HSCT</B>
</h4><P>No national standards exist for in utero or fetal HSCT, and the overall risks for 
transmitting infections to a fetus through HSCT 
(<I>409,410</I>) have not been determined. However, in addition to precautions appropriate for adult recipients, physicians performing 
in utero or fetal HSCT are advised to evaluate potential donors for evidence of 
active infectious diseases that could cause serious congenital infections (e.g., rubella, 
varicella, CMV, syphilis, or <I>To. gondii</I>) in the fetus (CIII).

<small><P>* For this report, HSCT is defined as any transplantation of blood- or 
marrow-derived hematopoietic stem cells, regardless of transplant type (e.g., allogeneic or autologous) 
or cell source (e.g., bone marrow, peripheral blood, or placental/umbilical cord blood). 
In addition, HSCT recipients are presumed immunocompetent at 
<U>&gt;</U>24 months after HSCT if they are not on immunosuppressive therapy and do not have graft-versus-host 
disease (GVHD), a condition that occurs when the transplanted cells recognize that the 
recipient's cells are not the same cells and attack them.
