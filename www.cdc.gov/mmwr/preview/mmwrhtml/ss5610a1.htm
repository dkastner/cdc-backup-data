</h3><P><b>Problem/Condition:</b> In 2006, CDC published recommendations to improve health and health care for women 
before pregnancy and between pregnancies (<I>CDC. Recommendations to improve preconception health and health 
care---United States: a report of the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception Care. 
MMWR 2006;55[No. RR-6]</I>). The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) provides data concerning 
maternal behaviors, health conditions, and experiences 
for women in the United States who have delivered a live birth.
</P><P><b>Reporting Period Covered:</b> 2004.
</P><P><b>Description of System:</b> PRAMS is an ongoing, state- and population-based surveillance system designed 
to monitor selected maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among 
women who deliver live-born infants in selected states and cities in the United States. PRAMS employs a mixed mode 
data-collection methodology; up to three self-administered questionnaires are mailed to a sample of mothers, 
and nonresponders are followed up with telephone interviews. Self-reported survey data are linked to selected 
birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, nonresponse, and noncoverage to create annual PRAMS 
analysis data sets that can be used to produce statewide estimates of perinatal health behaviors and experiences 
among women delivering live infants.
</P><P>This report summarizes data from 26 PRAMS reporting areas that collected data during 2004 and that had 
achieved overall weighted response rates of 
<U>&gt;</U>70% and had weighted data available by the time the analysis was conducted 
in January 2007. Data are reported on indicators regarding 18 behaviors and conditions that are relevant to 
preconception (i.e., prepregnancy) health and health care and 10 that are relevant to interconception (i.e., postpartum) health and 
health care. The number of questions that were administered varied by site; certain questions were not asked for all 
reporting areas.
</P><P><b>Results:</b> With respect to preconception maternal behaviors and experiences, mean overall prevalence was 23.2% 
for tobacco use, 50.1% for alcohol use, 35.1% for multivitamin use at least four times a week, 53.1% for nonuse 
of contraception among women who were not trying to become pregnant, 77.8% for ever having a dental visit 
before pregnancy, 30.3% for receiving prepregnancy health counseling, 3.6% for experiencing physical abuse, and 
18.5% for experiencing at least four stressors before pregnancy.
</P><P>With respect to preconception maternal health conditions, mean overall prevalence was 13.2% for women 
being underweight (body mass index [BMI]: &lt;19.8), 13.1% for being overweight (BMI: 26.0--29.0), and 21.9% for 
being obese (BMI: &gt;29.0). Mean overall prevalence was 1.8% for having diabetes, 6.9% for asthma, 2.2% 
for hypertension, 1.2% for heart problems, and 10.2% for anemia. Among women with a previous live birth, the 
mean 

overall prevalence of having a previous low birth weight infant was 11.6% and of having a previous preterm 
infant was 11.9%.
</P><P>With respect to interconception maternal behaviors and experiences, mean overall prevalence was 17.9% for 
tobacco use, 85.1% for contraceptive use, 15.7% for having symptoms of depression, and 84.8% for having social 
support. Mean overall prevalence was 7.5% for the most recent infant being born low birth weight, 10.4% for having 
a recent preterm infant, 89.3% for having a check-up, 89.0% for receiving contraceptive use counseling, 30.4% 
for having a dental visit, and 48.6% for receiving services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).
</P><P>Results varied by maternal age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy intention, and health insurance status. For certain 
risk behaviors and health conditions, mean overall prevalence was higher among women aged &lt;20 years, black 
women, women whose pregnancies were unintended, and women receiving Medicaid; however, no single subgroup 
was consistently at highest risk for all the indicators examined in this report.
</P><P><b>Interpretation:</b> PRAMS results varied among reporting areas. The prevalence estimates in the majority of 
reporting areas and for the majority of indicators suggest that a substantial number of women would benefit 
from preconception interventions to ensure that they enter pregnancy in optimal health. The results also 
demonstrate disparities among age and racial/ethnic subpopulations, especially with respect to prepregnancy medical 
conditions and access to health care both before conception and postpartum. Differences also exist in health behaviors 
between women who reported intended and unintended pregnancies.
</P><P><b>Public Health Action:</b> Maternal and child health programs can use PRAMS data to monitor improvements 
in maternal preconception and interconception behaviors and health status. The data presented in this report, 
which were collected before publication of CDC's recommendations to improve preconception health and health care 
in the United States, can be used as a baseline to monitor progress toward improvements in preconception 
and interconception health following publication of the recommendations. These data also can be used to 
identify specific groups at high risk that would benefit from targeted interventions and to plan and evaluate programs 
aimed at promoting positive maternal and infant health behaviors, experiences, and reproductive outcomes. In 
addition, the data can be used to inform policy decisions that affect the health of women and infants.

</h3>
</H3>
</P><P>In 2006, CDC published 10 recommendations to improve health and health care for women in the United States 
before and after pregnancy (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>) (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#box">Box</a>). CDC developed these recommendations on the basis of a review of published research and 
the opinions of specialists from the CDC/ATSDR Preconception Care Work Group and the Select Panel on Preconception 
Care. The report outlined four goals: 1) improve the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of men and women 
related to preconception health; 2) ensure that all women of childbearing age in the United States receive preconception care 
services (i.e., evidence-based risk screening, health promotion, and interventions) that will enable them to enter pregnancy in 
optimal health; 3) reduce risks indicated by a previous adverse pregnancy outcome through interventions during the 
interconception period, which can prevent or minimize health problems for a mother and her future children; and 4) reduce disparities 
in adverse pregnancy outcomes (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>).
</P><P>The recommendations address both preconception and interconception care. Preconception care is defined as a set 
of interventions to identify and modify biomedical, behavioral, and social risks to a woman's health or pregnancy 
outcome through prevention and management. Interconception care refers to the time between pregnancies, including, but 
not restricted to, the postpartum period.
</P><P>The goal of the recommendations is to improve the health of the woman and increase the likelihood of 
a good pregnancy outcome by encouraging positive behaviors and 
controlling or preventing health problems before 
pregnancy. Providing women with postpartum care serves 
a similar purpose and has the added advantage of targeting for intervention 
women who have had previous poor infant or maternal outcomes and are at risk for subsequent poor outcomes 
(<I>2</I>).
<H4>
<B>Risk Factors</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Maternal behaviors known to be related to poor birth outcomes include tobacco use, alcohol use, and failure to 
consume adequate folic acid through multivitamins or diet. Evidence suggests that successful interventions targeting these 
behaviors prior to pregnancy are associated with improved health of the woman and her infant. For example, tobacco use 
during pregnancy is associated with preterm birth, small size for gestational age, and low birth weight 
(<I>3--5</I>). Tobacco use also contributes to the occurrence of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, fetal death, and sudden infant death syndrome 
(<I>6--9</I>); approximately 5% of infant deaths in the United States can be attributed to maternal tobacco use 
(<I>10</I>). Use of alcohol during pregnancy is associated with spontaneous abortions, birth defects, and developmental disorders, many of which occur early 
in gestation before the woman is aware that she is pregnant 
(<I>11,12</I>). Frequent alcohol use during pregnancy is associated 
with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which is characterized by impaired growth and mental retardation in the infant 
(<I>13,14</I>). Inadequate folic acid intake before pregnancy increases the risk for neural tube defects (NTDs) in the infant 
(<I>15</I>). NTDs affect an estimated 3,000 pregnancies annually, 
and 95% of children born with an NTD are born to couples with no history 
of these birth defects (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5317a3.htm">16</a>,17</I>). Taking a multivitamin or otherwise increasing folic acid intake to 400 
<I>&#181;</I>g daily can reduce the incidence of NTDs by 
50% (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019479.htm">18</a></I>).
</P><P>Other conditions associated with poor pregnancy outcomes include having an unintended pregnancy, experiencing 
physical abuse, and experiencing high levels of stress. Women who experience an unintended pregnancy are more likely than those 
with an intended pregnancy to have poor maternal nutrition, to use alcohol during pregnancy, and to have adverse maternal 
and infant outcomes (<I>19</I>). Physical abuse before pregnancy is related to an increased risk for low birth weight 
and increased maternal and infant mortality and morbidity 
(<I>20</I>). High levels of stress during pregnancy can result in an 
alteration of immune regulation in the fetus 
(<I>21</I>), and persistent disparities in health outcomes among minority women have 
been postulated to be associated with psychosocial indicators such as stress 
(<I>22</I>).
</P><P>Certain maternal health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, and obesity), if uncontrolled, can lead to poor 
infant outcomes and have a long-term negative impact on a woman's health. Uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy can result in 
a threefold increase in birth defects and maternal health problems 
(<I>23,24</I>). These risks are greatly reduced through 
proper diabetes management (<I>25</I>). Obesity before pregnancy and in early pregnancy is associated with late fetal death, 
antepartum stillbirth, early neonatal death, large-for-gestational-age 
infants, birth defects, preeclampsia, and hypertensive 
and thromboembolic disease (<I>26--29</I>). Diabetes and obesity are closely linked, and persons at high risk for either condition 
should be screened early to ensure a healthy prepregnancy weight. In addition to these conditions, having had a previous preterm, 
low birth weight, or small-for-gestational-age infant is a predictor of having a subsequent poor birth outcome 
(<I>30--32</I>).
<H4>
<B>Health-Care Utilization</B>
</H4>
</P><P>CDC's 2006 recommendations underscore the need to create a demand for accessible preconception health services 
among consumers, aid implementation of effective interventions to improve women's health, ensure that clinicians offer such 
services, and ensure that these services are covered by health insurance 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>). Talking to a health-care provider before becoming 
pregnant and obtaining appropriate counseling and screening can assist in identifying harmful behaviors and 
uncontrolled medical conditions that can be managed before pregnancy 
(<I>33--36</I>). Similarly, a prepregnancy dental visit can identify 
periodontal disease, which has been linked with an increased risk for low birth weight and preterm birth 
(<I>37--39</I>). Ensuring optimal maternal oral health before conception also has other potential benefits to both the woman and her infant 
(<I>40</I>).
</P><P>Because a woman might have a subsequent pregnancy, services in the postpartum period (e.g., a postpartum check-up, 
screening for postpartum depression, counseling about birth control, and accessing services such as the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children [WIC]) all are opportunities to help women maintain or regain good health 
(<I>41--46</I>). Approximately 17% of women in the United States aged 18--64 years lack health insurance, which limits their ability to 
access health-care services (<I>47</I>). A substantial proportion of these women have health insurance coverage only during and shortly 
after pregnancy. For preconception and postpartum interventions 
to succeed, women should have access to preventive and 
curative medical services before and after pregnancy.
</P><P>Although data regarding certain Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System 
(PRAMS) indicators have been reported previously 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5509a1.htm">48</a>--<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5211a1.htm">50</a></I>), this report groups multiple indicators related 
to preconception and interconception into a single document and provides estimates for 2004. The data presented in this report can be used as a baseline to monitor progress 
and 

assist states and federal agencies in setting priorities for policy and program planning related to improving preconception 
and interconception health and health care in the United States.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</H3>
<H4>
<B>Project Description</B>
</H4>
</P><P>PRAMS is an ongoing state- and population-based surveillance system designed to monitor selected 
self-reported maternal behaviors and experiences that occur before, during, and after pregnancy among women who deliver 
live-born infants in selected states and cities in the United States. PRAMS is administered in collaboration with state health 
departments by CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Reproductive Health. 
The project supports the activities of CDC's Safe Motherhood Initiative, which aims to reduce 
infant mortality and low infant birth weight.
</P><P>Since its inception in 1987, PRAMS has expanded from six reporting areas to 39 participating 
sites* in 2007 (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#fig">Figure</a>). This number includes 37 states, one tribal-state collaborative project, and one city. Collectively, PRAMS represents 
approximately 75% of all live births in the United States. In 2004, the year for which data in this report were collected, 30 
reporting areas (29 states and New York City) were conducting PRAMS projects, representing approximately 62% of all live births in 
the United States. This report includes data from 26 (87%) reporting 
areas<SUP>&#134;</SUP> that had achieved an overall weighted response rate 
of <U>&gt;</U>70% in 2004 and had weighted data available by the time the analysis was conducted in 
January 2007 (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#fig">Figure</a>).
<H4>
<B>Indicators Studied</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The PRAMS questionnaire collects information on multiple maternal behaviors, conditions, and experiences shortly 
before, during, and after pregnancies that resulted in the 
delivery of a live birth. This report includes data on 28 indicators, 
including 18 indicators that concern the preconception period and 10 that concern the interconception period. These 28 indicators 
were selected on the basis of their potential impact on maternal and infant well-being and relevance to preceonception 
and interconception health.
</P><P>
<B>Preconception Indicators</B>
</P><P>The 18 preconception indicators encompass two broad categories: 1) behaviors and experiences (tobacco use, alcohol 
use, multivitamin use, nonuse of contraception among those women who were not trying to become pregnant, dental visit, 
health counseling, physical abuse, and stress) and 2) health conditions (being underweight, overweight, or obese; having 
diabetes, asthma, hypertension, a heart problem, or 
anemia; or having a previous low birth weight or preterm infant) (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>).
</P><P>
<B>Interconception Indicators</B>
</P><P>The 10 interconception indicators include behaviors 
(tobacco use and contraceptive use) and experiences (symptoms 
of depression, presence of social support, recent low birth weight or preterm infant, check-up, counseling regarding 
contraceptive use, dental visit, and receipt of services from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants and Children [WIC]) (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>).
<H4>
<B>Data Collection</B>
</H4>
</P><P>A detailed explanation of the PRAMS methodology has been published previously 
(<I>51</I>). All participating sites use a standardized data collection methodology developed by CDC. At each site, a monthly stratified sample of 100--300 
new mothers is selected from recent birth certificates. PRAMS employs a mixed-mode data collection methodology in which up 
to three self-administered questionnaires are mailed to mothers, and nonrespondents are followed-up with a telephone 
interview. The first questionnaire usually is mailed 2--3 months after the delivery of a live-born infant to allow for collection 
of information about postpartum maternal and infant experiences. Efforts to contact women end 9 months postpartum in 
order to minimize recall bias. Survey data are linked to 
selected birth certificate data and weighted for sample design, 
nonresponse, and noncoverage. The PRAMS questionnaire is revised periodically to reflect changing priorities and emerging issues. All 
data 

highlighted in this report were collected with the phase five version of the questionnaire 
(<I>52</I>), which was implemented with the 2004 birth cohort.
<H4>
<B>Data Analysis</B>
</H4>
</P><P>To minimize nonresponse bias, the CDC PRAMS team 
established 70% as the minimum overall weighted response rate 
for site data to be included in published results. This 
report includes data from 26 reporting areas that collected data 
during 2004<SUP>&#167;</SUP> and that had achieved overall weighted response rates of 
<U>&gt;</U>70% and had weighted data available by the time the 
analysis was conducted in January 2007. The weighted response rate indicates the proportion of women sampled who completed 
a survey, adjusted for sample design.
</P><P>PRAMS survey respondents are women who gave birth to a live infant within the previous 2--9 months. In this 
report, indicators concerning the time before the woman's pregnancy are referred to as preconception indicators; these indicators 
also are referred to as prepregnancy indicators because women were asked to recall events specific to the 1--12 months before 
their recent pregnancy, which could be considered to be only part of the preconception period. Indicators concerning the time 
after the birth of the infant are referred to as interconception indicators; these indicators also are referred to as 
postpartum indicators because they refer to events that occurred from the birth through 2--9 months postpartum but not to the 
entire interconception period.
</P><P>Prevalence estimates are presented by reporting area. Data on certain indicators were available for all 26 reporting areas 
and were derived from core questions that all PRAMS reporting areas use. Other indicators 
were available only for selected reporting areas and were derived from optional site-selected questions. Definitions of each indicator and a list of reporting areas 
that collected data on each indicator are reported (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>).
</P><P>Alcohol use was calculated on the basis of self-reported consumption of any alcohol during the 3 months before 
pregnancy among those women who reported having any alcoholic drinks during the previous 2 years. Binge drinking (i.e., 
consuming five or more drinks in one sitting) was not examined. In certain states, two questions were asked regarding oral 
health. Prepregnancy and postpartum dental visits were 
assessed only for those reporting areas that asked women first whether 
they had ever had their teeth cleaned by a dentist or dental hygienist and then whether they had their teeth cleaned before or 
after they became pregnant. In four additional reporting 
areas (Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, and West 
Virginia),<B> </B>women were asked only whether they had had a dental visit before or during pregnancy and were not included in the analysis. For 
the physical abuse indicator, two reporting areas (Oregon and Vermont) did not ask about abuse to teen mothers, and so no 
data on this indicator are shown for women aged &lt;20 years for these reporting areas. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated on 
the basis of Institute of Medicine definitions 
(<I>53</I>). Three problematic categories were assessed: underweight (BMI: 
&lt;19.8), overweight (BMI: 26.0--29.0), and obese (BMI: &gt;29.0). For previous low birth weight and previous preterm 
birth, information was recorded from the mother's report on the questionnaire. Recent low birth weight and preterm birth 
were calculated on the basis of birth certificate data that are linked to PRAMS data. Because only data from one infant of twin 
and multiple births are selected randomly for PRAMS, estimates presented in this report might differ from reports by 
vital statistics agencies.
</P><P>For each indicator, data are presented by four demographic variables: maternal age group, race/ethnicity, 
pregnancy intention, and health insurance status. Age group and race/ethnicity were ascertained from the birth certificate file. Race 
and ethnicity are combined as a single variable subdivided as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic other, 
and Hispanic (of any race). Pregnancy intention was determined by a woman's answer to the survey question, &quot;Thinking back 
to just before you got pregnant with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming pregnant?&quot; Out of four possible 
options, women who answered that they wanted to be pregnant either then or sooner were considered to have an intended 
pregnancy, and women who answered either that they wanted to be pregnant later or that they did not want to be pregnant then or at 
any time in the future were considered to have an unintended pregnancy. For the indicator regarding prepregnancy nonuse 
of contraception, women who were not trying to become pregnant and not using contraception were identified as those 
who answered &quot;no&quot; to the question, &quot;When you got pregnant with your new baby, were you trying to get pregnant?&quot; and &quot;no&quot; 
to the question, &quot;When you got pregnant with your new baby, were your or your husband or partner doing anything to 
keep from getting pregnant?&quot; Preconception health insurance status was classified as private, Medicaid, or none. 
Interconception health insurance status (i.e., coverage at time of delivery) was classified as private, Medicaid, or 
other.<SUP>&#182;
</SUP>
</P><P>All analyses were produced using weighted PRAMS data. Percentages and standard errors were calculated by using 
PROC CROSSTAB in SUDAAN version 9.0 to account for the complex sampling design used by PRAMS 
(<I>55</I>). Weighted data were pooled from all reporting areas to calculate mean overall combined estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
PROC DESCRIPT in SUDAAN was used to test for contrasts 
between demographic characteristics, only among the estimates for 
all reporting areas combined. The contrast was considered statistically significant for the demographic characteristic when the 
p-value was &lt;0.05. Only differences in prevalence that were statistically significant are reported. When the number 
of respondents was &lt;30 persons, prevalence was not reported. Prevalence based on &lt;60 respondents are reported and 
footnoted. All missing observations are excluded.

</P><P>The presentation of results is divided into three sections: preconception behaviors and experiences, preconception 
health conditions, and postpartum behaviors and experiences. Data are presented on the mean overall prevalence of each indicator 
by site (<a href="ss5610a1.htm#tab2">Tables 2</a>--<a href="ss5610a1.htm#tab4">4</a>) and by indicators for all reporting areas with available data stratified by four maternal characteristics: 
age, race/ethnicity, pregnancy intention, and health 
insurance status (<a href="ss5610a1.htm#tab5">Tables 5</a>--<a href="ss5610a1.htm#tab32">32</a>). Unless otherwise indicated, data are 
presented for all 26 reporting areas. Periods noted regarding the preconception health indicators reflect how survey questions were 
asked; depending on the question, indicators might refer to the month before pregnancy, the 3 months before pregnancy, or the 
12 months before birth.

<B>Previous Preterm Infant</B>
</P><P>Birth of a previous preterm infant was determined from respondents' reporting that they had a previous live birth and 
that the infant born just before their most recent infant had been born 
<U>&gt;</U>3 weeks before the due date. In 2004, for all 26 
reporting areas combined, mean prevalence of having a previous preterm infant was 11.9% (range: 7.7% 
[Minnesota]--16.7% [Mississippi]) (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>).

<B>Symptoms of Depression</B>
</P><P>Respondents were considered to have symptoms of depression if they reported at 2--9 months postpartum that they 
often or always were feeling down, depressed, or hopeless or had little interest or little pleasure in normal activities since the birth 
of their new infant. Information was available in 16 reporting areas (Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Maine,

<B>Social Support</B>
</P><P>Postpartum social support was assessed on the basis of 
respondents indicating that they had at least three of a list of 
five possible sources of help since the birth of their new infant at 2--9 months postpartum. Information was available in 
three reporting areas (North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Rhode 
Island). In 2004, for all three reporting areas combined, 
mean prevalence of postpartum social support was 84.8% (range: 84.1% [Oklahoma]--86.0% [Rhode Island]) (<a href = "ss5610a1.htm#tab4">Table 4</a>).

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Discussion</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>The indicators discussed in this report reflect the goals and recommendations outlined in CDC's 2006 recommendations 
to improve preconception health and health care in the United States 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>). The results presented in this report can serve as 
a baseline for monitoring changes in preconception and interconception behaviors, health, and health care 
following implementation of the 2006 recommendations. PRAMS data also are useful in measuring progress toward meeting 
<I>Healthy People 2010</I> objectives (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5509a1.htm">48</a></I>). In addition, certain reporting 
areas have used these data to report on Title V core and 
state-negotiated performance measures regarding preconception care 
(<I>56</I>); 23 reporting areas (14 of which were PRAMS 
reporting areas in 2004) have identified Title V Priority Needs focused on preconception health 
(<I>57</I>).
</P><P>The findings outlined in this report indicate that a substantial proportion of women are not engaging in healthy 
behaviors during the preconception period. Healthier living in the preconception period can lead to better women's health and 
improved pregnancy outcomes. With respect to the postpartum period, results were encouraging; a smaller proportion of women 
were 

engaging in risk behaviors, and a greater percentage were using health services postpartum than were 
doing so preconception. However, disparities evident in the preconception period persisted into the postpartum period.
<H4>
<B>Preconception Behaviors and Experiences</B>
</H4>
</P><P>
<B>Risk Behaviors and Experiences</B>
</P><P>Tobacco and alcohol use continue to be priority areas for intervention. Maternal tobacco use before pregnancy 
was prevalent. In the majority of reporting areas, 
tobacco use was highest among teenagers, white women, women 
whose pregnancies were unintended, and women with Medicaid coverage. Findings of high prepregnancy tobacco use among 
teens and white women are consistent with another population-based study that examined prenatal tobacco use utilizing 
birth certificate data (<I>5</I>8).
</P><P>Current medical guidelines advise against any alcohol use around the time of conception and throughout pregnancy; 
no amount of alcohol consumption is known to be safe, and any alcohol use puts a woman at elevated risk for having a 
FAS infant (<I>59</I>). The results outlined in this report indicate that alcohol use in the 3 months before pregnancy is common. 
This finding is consistent with data cited previously 
(<I>60--62</I>). Additional interventions are needed to make women aware of 
the potential harm to the fetus that can be caused by alcohol use during early gestation, before a woman might be aware that she 
is pregnant. Preconception care should include counseling strategies that emphasize these risks and the provision and use 
of effective contraception.
</P><P>Physical abuse can result not only in trauma to a woman and to a fetus if she is pregnant but also in high levels of stress 
and other risk behaviors that could adversely affect maternal health and pregnancy outcomes (e.g., tobacco, 
alcohol and drug use; late entry into prenatal care; and preterm labor and low birth weight) 
(<I>63--66</I>)<I>.</I> This report indicates a low overall 
prevalence of physical abuse before pregnancy, similar to other studies 
(<I>67</I>). Women most likely to report abuse and high levels of 
stress were those aged &lt;20 years, black women, women with unintended pregnancies, and women who were Medicaid 
recipients before pregnancy. Preconception care counseling should include screening to identify women who might have 
experienced abuse and provide referrals and access to other resources.
</P><P>Adequate folic acid consumption has been proven to be an effective preventative measure that reduces the occurrence 
of NTDs (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00019479.htm">18</a></I>). However, only 35.1% of women took a multivitamin or prenatal vitamin four or more times a week in 
the month prior to pregnancy. The findings provided in this 
report are consistent with a state study and a national study 
that reported a higher prevalence of multivitamin use among older women and white women 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5625a3.htm">68</a>,69</I>).
</P><P>The consistent and correct use of effective contraception is central to all of these interventions. Providing women the 
ability to plan pregnancies so health promotion interventions can be implemented contributes to positive outcomes. 
Planned pregnancies have been demonstrated to result in better outcomes for women and their infants 
(<I>70</I>). However, only half of women who were not trying to become pregnant were 
using contraception.
</P><P>CDC recommends that risk assessment and health education be a part of primary care visits for women of reproductive 
age and that a prepregnancy check-up be incorporated as a component of maternity care that is covered by insurance 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>).<I> </I>Results from this report indicate that few women are benefiting from such preventive services; less than one third of women 
reported that they had talked to a health-care provider about preparing for a healthy pregnancy. Expanding access to 
preconception counseling by a health-care provider is critical to achieve the goal of allowing all women to enter pregnancy in optimal health.
</P><P>Another important indicator of access to preventive services is the use of oral health-care services. Good oral health 
and dental visits before pregnancy might help reduce the number of preterm births and low birth weight infants 
(<I>37--39</I>). More than three fourths of women in PRAMS reporting areas that 
assessed prepregnancy dental visits had been to a dentist at 
some point before their most recent pregnancy. Similar to other health-care service indicators, prevalence varied 
by maternal characteristics, with high-risk groups having the lowest level of service utilization.
<H4>
<B>Preconception Health Conditions</B>
</H4>
</P><P>In addition to addressing risk behaviors, an aim of preconception care is to identify and provide appropriate management 
of chronic diseases that might affect women's health during and after pregnancy and have a lifetime impact on infants. 
The results of this analysis confirm that a substantial proportion of women have medical conditions in the preconception 
period that could have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcomes. Among prepregnancy medical conditions studied, the 
highest 

prevalence was for being overweight and underweight, followed by having anemia, asthma, hypertension, and 
diabetes. Prevalence of these chronic conditions varied by maternal characteristics. Similar findings have been reported among 
the general population, with higher rates among minority women and those with low incomes 
(<I>71</I>). Although PRAMS data cannot be used to assess whether these factors are being medically managed in the preconception period, they highlight 
the importance of women receiving quality care before pregnancy and the need for proper management of chronic diseases 
before pregnancy occurs.
<H4>
<B>Postpartum Behaviors and Experiences</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The interconception period provides an opportunity to identify and address known risk factors from prior pregnancies 
(e.g., a previous infant death, fetal loss, low birth weight, or preterm birth) and to implement interventions to reduce the risk 
for women experiencing the same adverse pregnancy outcome again. Interventions can be targeted to women with a 
previous adverse outcome and those with risk factors such as tobacco use, low folic acid intake, alcohol use, obesity, and diabetes. 
The findings in this report underscore the importance 
of interconception care, especially for women with previous 
adverse outcomes.
</P><P>
<B>Risk Behaviors and Experiences</B>
</P><P>The same risk behaviors (e.g., smoking and not using contraception) and protective behaviors (e.g., visiting a 
health-care provider) often continue (or resume) in the postpartum period. In general, this report demonstrates that negative 
behaviors are less prevalant in the postpartum period than in the prepregnancy period. Even so, postpartum health-care visits offer 
another opportunity to address medical risk factors, promote 
behavioral change, provide prevention services, and link women 
with appropriate clinical and public health programs.
</P><P>For example, preventing tobacco use in the postpartum 
period might improve future reproductive outcomes; tobacco 
use during pregnancy is a risk factor for multiple complications, including placenta previa, abruption placentae, preterm birth, 
and low birth weight (<I>3,4,72</I>). Women who smoke could benefit from interconception clinical and public health services on 
tobacco use cessation to reduce risks to them, their 
infants, and to future children should they become pregnant again.
</P><P>Similarly, use of effective contraception is an important 
determinant of unintended pregnancy, and offering 
contraception services to women postpartum is important for planning future pregnancies. Birth spacing has been demonstrated 
repeatedly to reduce adverse events for women and infants 
(<I>73</I>), and almost 90% of women reported using some form of 
contraception in the 2--9 months after delivery.
</P><P>Postpartum depression threatens a woman's health and the social, emotional, and cognitive development of her child 
(<I>74</I>). Thus, identifying and treating postpartum depression in the interconception period is important for the mother and 
her family. The data presented in this report indicate that 15.7% of women with recent deliveries reported experiencing 
symptoms of postpartum depression; this percentage is slightly higher than other estimates of postpartum depression 
(<I>75</I>). If women are screened for postpartum depression at a postpartum health-care visit, numerous treatment options that are available can 
be offered (<I>76</I>).
</P><P>More than three fourths of women reported using postpartum health services. At least 85% of women in 10 
reporting areas attended a postpartum check up, and over three fourths of women in four reporting areas received postpartum 
contraceptive counseling. This represents an important opportunity for health-care providers to reach women during the 
interconception period.
<H4>
<B>Poor Birth Outcomes</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The data presented in this report indicate that as many as one in 10 women have had a poor birth outcome and 
are candidates for interventions to improve maternal health during the interconception period. These findings are similar 
to national estimates published by the National Center for Health Statistics 
(<I>77</I>). Certain subgroups of women (i.e., 
black women, women whose most recent pregnancy was 
unintended, and those who had Medicaid coverage before pregnancy or 
at delivery) displayed higher rates of previous low birth weight and preterm deliveries. This finding underscores the need 
for preconception clinical and public health services and programs targeted 
towards subpopulations of women who are identified to be at risk for poor birth outcomes.
<H4>
<B>Disparities</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The data presented in this report indicate the existence of disparities by maternal characteristics, particularly differences 
in behaviors, health conditions, and utilization of care. For each indicator studied, results varied by age group, 
race/ethnicity, pregnancy intention, and health insurance status; no one group was consistently at highest risk.
</P><P>For example, white women reported the highest prevalence of prepregnancy and postpartum tobacco use and 
prepregnancy alcohol use. Women aged &lt;20 years had the highest prevalence of many risk behaviors and health conditions (e.g., tobacco 
use before and after pregnancy, experiencing abuse and high levels of stress before pregnancy, being underweight, being 
anemic, and experiencing postpartum symptoms of depression) examined in this report. Conversely, these women were more likely 
to have postpartum contraceptive use counseling and use contraceptives postpartum. Women aged 
20--34 years and women aged <U>&gt;</U>35 years had higher prevalence of 
being overweight and obese than women aged &lt;20 years. Older women, particularly 
those aged <U>&gt;</U>35 years, also had the highest prevalence of protective behaviors such as taking a multivitamin before pregnancy 
and utilizing health services (e.g., dental visits, preconception health 
counseling, and postpartum visits). These findings are similar 
to those reported previously (<I>69,78</I>).
</P><P>Black women reported the highest prevalence of prepregnancy stress, overweight, hypertension, anemia, and giving birth 
to recent low birth weight infants and preterm infants. Black and Hispanic women were more likely than white women 
and women of other races to experience prepregnancy physical abuse, prepregnancy diabetes, and the birth of a previous low 
birth weight infant. Such differences have been reported previously 
(<I>79--81</I>). Culturally appropriate interventions to 
improve preconception and interconception health care among minority women should be explored as a mechanism to 
reduce persistent disparities in maternal and infant health 
<I>(82,83).</I>
</P><P>Women with an unintended pregnancy had consistently higher prevalences for negative behaviors, experiences, 
and conditions. These findings are consistent with the results from other studies on unintended pregnancy 
(<I>70,84</I>). Because women who have received preconception health promotion interventions are more likely to have intended pregnancies 
(<I>85</I>), women should be encouraged to work with their partners, health-care providers, and public health programs to implement 
a reproductive life plan to ensure optimal timing and health for pregnancy 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5506a1.htm">1</a></I>).
</P><P>Women with private health insurance were more likely to report positive behaviors and experiences, including 
multivitamin use, postpartum social support, and access to services (e.g., prepregnancy and postpartum dental visits, prepregnancy 
health counseling, postpartum check-up, and postpartum contraceptive counseling). Medicaid and other funding programs can 
play an important role in addressing the access gap and providing continuity of care. A lack of financial coverage for the 
health-care component of preconception care is a major 
barrier to implementation. Women with Medicaid coverage 
before the current pregnancy might constitute a high-risk population that can be targeted for preconception care services such as screening 
and counseling (<I>86</I>).

</H3>
</P><P>The findings presented in this report are subject to a number of limitations. First, because PRAMS does not have data on 
all reproductive-age women, only on women who recently gave birth to a live infant in the selected PRAMS reporting areas, 
the prevalence estimates for indicators in this report cannot be generalized to the entire population of reproductive-age 
women. Second, the data reflect only certain behaviors and risks shortly before, during, and after pregnancy; the 28 
indicators discussed in this report do not represent the universe of measures related to preconception and interconception 
care. Preconception indicators focus only on the 1--12 months before pregnancy, and interconception indicators are based 
on postpartum behaviors and experiences 2--9 months after the birth of a live 
infant. This is a period when behaviors might change because of pregnancy intention and heightened concerns about health. The value of the data for monitoring 
the impact of interventions might be limited by the short timeframe of data collection; however observing changes in risk 
factors in the time surrounding pregnancy might provide information about the impact of population-based interventions. 
Third, PRAMS does not collect data on men, who are important contributors to 
reproductive health. Fourth, PRAMS survey data are self-reported, so negative 
behaviors might be underestimated and positive behaviors overestimated; variables such as 
height, weight, or reported medical conditions cannot be confirmed. Finally, limitations exist with respect to certain indicators. 
For example, the prepregnancy dental question does not specify during what period before pregnancy a women might have 
visited the dentist. For the diabetes indicator, preliminary results from a PRAMS questionnaire evaluation have demonstrated 
that 

women do not differentiate well between the two questions on the PRAMS survey related to prepregnancy diabetes 
and gestational diabetes, resulting in ambiguity as to whether women had prepregnancy or gestational diabetes (Research 
Triangle Institute, unpublished data, 2007). This is important to note because recommendations for care of women with 
prepregnancy and gestational diabetes differ 
(<I>25</I>). Regarding WIC enrollment, what percentage of women were actually eligible for 
these services is not known. Despite these limitations, PRAMS data are a valuable source of information 
regarding maternal and infant health indicators, many of which are not collected elsewhere.

<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Conclusions</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>Targeted and accessible public health and clinical services are needed to improve women's health and the health of 
their infants. The findings discussed in this report document the need for clinical and public health preconception 
and interconception services to ensure that all women have access to health care and are able to enjoy the potential benefits 
of evidence-based interventions.
</P><P>PRAMS data have been used previously to gain support for a wide range of programs and initiatives aimed at improving 
the health of women and infants around the time of pregnancy, not only in the preconception and interconception periods 
(<I>87</I>). The data presented in this report can be used to track progress in implementing CDC's 2006 recommendations 
to improve preconception health and health care and to identify areas in need of policy and programmatic 
improvements. Further analyses are needed to better understand the impact of specific indicators on health outcomes for women and 
their infants.
