<H1>Trends in Blood Lead Levels Among Children --- Boston, 
Massachusetts, 1994--1999</H1>

<P>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and 
national 

childhood blood lead surveillance data from 19 states indicated that average 
blood lead levels (BLLs) in young children decreased during the late 1990s 
(<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00032080.htm">1</a>--<a href="mm4950a3.htm">3</a></I>). The proportion of children tested who had BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL declined from 10.5% in 1996 
to 7.6% in 1998, although the proportion was higher in certain counties 
(<I><a href="mm4950a3.htm">3</a></I>). To determine whether a similar decline had occurred in Boston, Massachusetts, where a 
high proportion of children are tested each year, and whether any changes were similar 
in high- and low-risk neighborhoods, CDC, in collaboration with the Boston 
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (BCLPPP) performed an analysis of BLLs 
among children aged 6--72 months in Boston during 1994--1999. The results indicate that 
BLLs in Boston declined during this period, but because of the geographic variation in 
lead exposure, continued surveillance will be necessary to eliminate childhood 
lead poisoning. 
</P><P>Private laboratories are mandated by Massachusetts law to report all blood 
lead test results to the state laboratory. BCLPPP receives all blood lead test results 
for Boston residents from the state laboratory. Massachusetts lead screening 
regulations require that health-care providers screen children at age 9--12 months and 
annually up to age 48 months. Children at high risk for lead poisoning are screened every 
6 months during ages 6 months--3 years and annually from ages 3--6 years. 
The proportion of children tested who had BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL and <U>&gt;</U>20 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL by fiscal year (FY) from July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1999, was computed. Children were counted 
once in each FY in which they had at least one blood lead test, and the highest test result 
in a given FY was considered in the analysis. Because sample contamination of 
a capillary test can result in a slight over-estimation of BLLs, only tests performed 
on venous samples with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>10 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL were considered in the numerator, and 
tests using both venous and capillary samples were used in the denominator 
(<I>4,5</I>). Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research data were used to 
estimate the population of children aged &lt;6 years for 1994 and 1998 
(<I>4</I>). U.S. census data from 1990 were used to characterize 16 Boston neighborhoods by ZIP code according 
to factors that may indicate risk for lead exposure (e.g., percentage of pre-1950 
housing, minority children, and children aged &lt;6 years living in poverty). Housing 
parcel information was obtained from tax assessor data.
</P><P>The number of children aged 6--72 months screened annually in Boston 
declined 23%, from 35,304 (73.3% of the population aged &lt;6 years) in 1994 to 27,233 (61.6% 
of population aged &lt;6 years) in 1999 (<a href = "mm5017a3.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). However, screening among 
children aged 9--48 months remained high (82% during FY 1999).
</P><P>During 1994--1999, the overall prevalence of children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL declined 45%, from 9.3% (3265) to 5.1% (1398). The prevalence of children with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>20 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL declined 66%, from 1.5 % (545) to 0.5% (140) (<a href = "mm5017a3.htm#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Neighborhoods 
with prevalence rates in the upper tertile in 1994 had a higher percentage of children 
living in poverty, Spanish-speaking households, and vacant parcels than neighborhoods 
with lower prevalence rates (<a href = "mm5017a3.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). Overall, about two thirds of houses were built 
before 1950, and no substantial differences were found in the proportion of houses 
built before 1950 between the highest and lowest risk neighborhoods. The prevalence 
of elevated BLLs declined from 1994 to 1999 in all 16 neighborhoods, with the 
highest absolute average decline (4.8%) in neighborhoods with the highest prevalence in 
1994. In 1999, six high-risk neighborhoods accounted for 80% of children with elevated 
BLLs, 

approximately the same as in 1994 (83%).
</P><P>The decline in prevalence of elevated BLLs during 1994--1999 was similar 
across age groups: 51% among children aged &lt;12 months, 42% among children aged 
12--36 months, and 46% among children aged 36--72 months.

</P><h3><B>Editorial Note:&nbsp; </B>
</h3><P>The findings in this report indicate that the prevalence of 
elevated BLLs in Boston declined consistently during 1994--1999, similar to declines 
reported from 19 states (<I><a href="mm4950a3.htm">3</a></I>). Building of new houses and remodeling of older houses 
that removed lead painted building components, such as windows, may have 
contributed to this decrease (<I>6</I>). In addition, under the Massachusetts Lead Law*, BCLPPP 
has required property owners to correct lead paint hazards in dwellings occupied 
by children aged &lt;6 years. Since 1985, approximately 6800 de-leading 
code enforcement activities have occurred in Boston, and the law has encouraged 
many additional property owners to comply with de-leading activities (BCLPPP, 
unpublished data, 2000).
</P><P>Although BLLs have declined in all Boston neighborhoods, levels remained 
higher in 1999 in the areas with the highest levels in 1994. These high-risk neighborhoods 
are characterized by higher proportions of minority children, children living in poverty, 
and vacant properties; a high proportion of old housing, likely to have leaded paint, is 
found in all neighborhoods. Low socioeconomic status and associated deterioration of 
older housing are major contributors to lead exposure in Boston 
(<I>7</I>).
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, reporting 
of blood lead test results varied among different laboratories; therefore, results may 
not be uniform. Second, children at high risk for blood lead poisoning also may have 
high screening rates. Third, this analysis does not include lead exposure 
measures associated with the children in the study; as a result, the prevalence rates in 
the population screened may not be representative of all children in Boston. Finally, 
the use of older housing and demographic information (i.e., census and tax assessor 
data) may not reflect changes in some Boston neighborhoods.
</P><P>Approximately 1300 children in Boston are identified annually with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>10 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, levels high enough to adversely affect cognitive development and behavior. One of 
the national health objectives for 2010 is to eliminate childhood lead poisoning 
(<I>8</I>). Because of the substantial geographic variation in lead exposure, continued use 
of blood lead data for surveillance purposes will be essential in Boston and 
other jurisdictions to focus resources on high-risk neighborhoods and to achieve the 
health objective.
