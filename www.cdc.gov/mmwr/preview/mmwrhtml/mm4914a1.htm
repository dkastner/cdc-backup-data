<h1>Salmonellosis Associated with Chicks and Ducklings ----
Michigan and Missouri, Spring 1999</h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<P>During the spring of 1999, outbreaks of salmonellosis associated with handling
chicks and ducklings occurred in Michigan and Missouri. This report summarizes the
epidemiologic information for the outbreaks and provides an overview of legislative efforts
to control the distribution of chicks and ducklings. These outbreaks demonstrate that
handling chicks and ducklings is a health risk, especially for children, and highlight the
need for thorough handwashing after contact with chicks, ducklings, and other young fowl.
<H4>
<B>Michigan</B>
</H4>
<P>In May 1999, the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) was notified
of an increase in <I>Salmonella</I> serotype Infantis infections with closely related
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns; 21 case-patients were reported with onset of
illness during April 1--July 31, 1999. Ages of infected persons ranged from 8 days to 82
years (mean: 25 years); eight (38%) were aged &lt;10 years. Twelve (57%) were female.
Symptoms reported during patient interviews included diarrhea (81%), fever (57%),
bloody diarrhea (24%), and vomiting (14%). Three patients were hospitalized. Overall, 17
(82%) patients reported direct and/or indirect contact with young fowl: eight (38%) with
chicks, two (10%) with ducklings, one (5%) with pheasant, and six (29%) with multiple
species, including chicks and ducklings. Of the young fowl that were traceable, 88% were
shipped from a single hatchery.
</P><P>MDCH conducted a case-control study to identify exposures associated with
illness. Nineteen patients were enrolled and were matched by age and place of residence to
37 healthy controls using sequential-digit dialing. During the 5 days before illness
onset, 14 (74%) of 19 patients had direct contact with young fowl or resided in a household
that raised fowl (chicks, ducklings, goslings, pheasants, and/or turkeys) compared with
six (16%) of 37 controls (matched odds ratio [MOR]=20; 95% confidence interval
[CI]=3--378). In several households, young birds were kept inside the home. One child
kept young birds in his bedroom and another carried chicks inside his jacket.
</P><P>MDCH, with assistance from the Michigan Department of Agriculture (MDA),
visited the implicated hatchery in September 1999. During the spring, the hatchery
shipped approximately 100,000 birds per week by mail order directly to customers and to
several feed and farm supply retail outlets across the state. Fowl were shipped in lots of
25
to 100 birds, and usually were raised for backyard use (i.e., meat and egg production
for the family).<I> S</I>. Infantis with the outbreak PFGE pattern was recovered from three of
47 environmental samples and five of 33 bird samples taken at the hatchery. Other
<I>Salmonella</I> serotypes also were isolated from the environmental samples, including
serotypes Montevideo (seven), Chester (one), and Mbandaka (one).
<H4>
<B>Missouri</B>
</H4>
<P>In April 1999, the Missouri Department of Health (MDOH) noted a cluster of
<I>Salmonella</I> serotype Typhimurium infections with an identical PFGE pattern; 40
case-patients were identified with onset of illness during April 4--May 30, 1999. The ages of
infected persons ranged from 8 months to 46 years (mean: 13 years); 28 (70%) were age
&lt;20 years; 23 (58%) were male. Symptoms reported by the 33 patients
interviewed included fever (42%), bloody diarrhea (27%), stomach cramps (27%), and vomiting
(21%). Three patients were hospitalized. Overall, 32 (97%) persons reported exposure to
young fowl: 18 (56%) were exposed to chicks, 10 (31%) to ducklings, three (9%) to both
chicks and ducklings, and one (3%) to a young turkey.
</P><P>MDOH conducted a case-control study of persons exposed to chicks or ducklings
to identify whether specific behaviors were associated with illness. Twenty
case-patients were enrolled; 40 controls who had been exposed to chicks and ducklings during
the same time were identified through media advertisements and word-of-mouth.
During the 4 weeks before onset of patient illness, chicks or ducklings that were identified as ill
by the patient or handler were associated with human illness (odd ratio [OR]=21; 95%
CI=2--508); handwashing after handling fowl was protective against illness (OR=0.0; 95%
CI=0.0--0.2).
<H4>
<B>Legislative Efforts</B>
</H4>
<P>During February 2000, CDC contacted 51 state and territorial public health
departments to ascertain laws on the sale of baby fowl to noncommercial distributors
and private persons; 28 (55%) responded. Ten (36%) states have laws restricting the sale
of baby fowl for noncommercial purposes, including the sale of fowl aged &lt;3 weeks
(Indiana and Maryland), &lt;4 weeks (Ohio and Pennsylvania), &lt;8 weeks (Massachusetts and
Virginia), and &lt;12 weeks (Connecticut). In addition, Connecticut, Ohio, and Virginia
require fowl to be sold in groups of greater than five birds. Illinois prohibits the sale of
chicks during the Easter season, and Kansas requires persons to have a temporary or
permanent license to sell chicks.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
<P> Although most of the 1.4 million human salmonellosis cases that
occur annually in the United States are caused by foodborne sources
(<I>1</I>), direct contact with animals, particularly reptiles and occasionally birds, also may be a source of
infection (<I>2--4</I>). Most reptiles and many birds shed
<I>Salmonella</I> in their feces. Humans become infected when contaminated food, hands, or other objects are placed in the
mouth; therefore, handwashing is critical to prevent
<I>Salmonella</I> infections following direct or indirect contact with animals. The Missouri outbreak described in this report and
previous outbreaks (<I>3,4</I>) demonstrate that handling young fowl can be a risk for
<I>Salmonella</I>

infections, particularly in children who receive fowl as gifts during Easter; children
have more frequent hand-to-mouth contact and are less likely to practice handwashing
after handling fowl. The Michigan outbreak describes the risk for infection associated
with the backyard production of fowl.
</P><P>Prevention efforts, such as sales restrictions and consumer education, may be
difficult because selling pet fowl and raising backyard fowl are largely unregulated.
Several states responding to the survey reported laws that restrict the sale of chicks,
ducklings, and other young fowl. Some of these restrictions are based on previous reports of
chick-associated and duckling-associated salmonellosis during Easter
(<I>5</I>). Enforcement also may be difficult because young fowl can be purchased by mail and Internet orders
from out-of-state hatcheries. State-mandated point-of-sale educational material may be
effective in educating consumers about the risk for salmonellosis. States may wish to
join Michigan and Missouri in issuing a press release during the spring of 2000 to raise
public awareness about the risk for <I>Salmonella</I>
 infections posed by young fowl. MDCH, MDA,  and MDOH have developed safety instructions to be distributed with young fowl
that emphasize the importance of handwashing and supervision of young children
interacting with young fowl.
</P><P>To prevent the transmission of
<I>Salmonella</I> from chicks, ducklings, and other
young fowl to humans, persons should avoid contact with feces and carefully wash their
hands with soap and water after handling young fowl or anything that has come in contact
with them. Chicks, ducklings, and other young fowl may not be appropriate pets for
children and should not be kept in households with infants, children aged &lt;5 years,
or immunocompromised persons. During investigations of
<I>Salmonella</I> infections, especially during spring and Easter, health-care workers and public health personnel
should consider contact with young fowl as a potential source and obtain cultures from
these animals if they are suspected as the source of infection.
