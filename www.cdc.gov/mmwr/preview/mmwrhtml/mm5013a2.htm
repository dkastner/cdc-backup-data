<h1>Occupational and Take-Home Lead Poisoning Associated With 
Restoring Chemically Stripped Furniture --- California, 1998</h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<P>The Occupational Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (OLPPP) of the 
California 

Department of Health Services and a county health department investigated cases 
of lead poisoning in six furniture workers and their families in 1998. The 
investigation, initiated after a blood test of a worker's child revealed an elevated blood lead 
level (BLL), found that lead remaining in previously painted or coated stripped wood 
was carried from the workplace on clothes and shoes and was the source of the child's 
lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Employers in industries in which workers 
restore or build using stripped wood should assess lead exposure and, when 
necessary, should establish a comprehensive lead safety program.
</P><P>During a routine medical examination, the 18-month-old child of a worker 
received a BLL test at his mother's request. The result, 26 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, met the CDC-recommended criterion for a lead poisoning case requiring clinical management (i.e., BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>20 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL) (<I>1</I>). A county public health nurse conducted a home visit and arranged blood testing 
of other family members. Laboratory tests revealed that the father, who worked for 
a company that refinished antique furniture, had a BLL of 46 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL and his 4-month-old daughter a BLL of 24 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL.
</P><P>The nurse contacted OLPPP, the state program that provides follow-up 
for occupational lead poisoning cases. An OLPPP industrial hygienist interviewed 
the employer who described the process for repairing and restoring wood 
furniture. Before arriving at the shop, the furniture was chemically stripped of all paint 
or coatings and was believed to be free of lead. Four carpenters made necessary 
repairs using power tools such as saws and planers. In an adjacent outdoor courtyard, 
two refinishers smoothed the wood using manual and power sanders, washed 
the furniture, and applied wax. Workers routinely ate and drank in work areas, wore 
no protective equipment, and returned home in work clothes and shoes.
</P><P>OLPPP instructed the employer to provide BLL and zinc protoporphyrin testing 
for the six workers and encouraged testing through the county of six family members 
who might have been affected by lead toxicity. All six workers had elevated BLLs: the 
two refinishers had BLLs of 29 and 54 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL, and the four carpenters had BLLs of 46, 
46, 47, and 56 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration lead 
regulation requires employees with BLLs 
<U>&gt;</U>40 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL to receive a medical examination, 
additional laboratory testing, and follow-up 
(<I>2</I>). Five of the six family members, aged 7--12 
years, did not have elevated BLLs; however, a 7-month-old infant, whose father's BLL 
was &gt;40 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL, had a BLL of 16 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL; it was 15 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL on retesting 30 days later.
</P><P>OLPPP recommended that the employer establish a comprehensive lead 
safety program that included exposure monitoring, good hygiene practices, 
medical examinations, protective clothing, respiratory protection, safe dust clean-up 
methods, and training. The employer arranged personal exposure monitoring and surface 
wipe sampling for lead and implemented workplace improvements, including a 
respiratory protection program; use of HEPA vacuum-attached power sanders; use of a 
high-efficiency toxic dust HEPA vacuum; daily clean uniforms; separate storage 
lockers, changing area with showers, and lunch room; warning signs; safety 
training addressing take-home lead; and a lead medical surveillance program. Workers' 
BLLs declined after these steps were taken, and the average BLL decreased 15 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL in approximately 3 months.
</P><P>The nurse advised the affected families on cleaning residences and vehicles. At 
the residence of the index case, a wipe sample taken on a carpet where the worker 
played with his children showed a lead surface concentration of 30 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP>. After steam 

cleaning the carpet, the level was 14 
<I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP>. This lead level on interior floors is below 
40 <I>&#181;</I>g/ft<SUP>2</SUP>, the threshold level the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to 
be harmful (<I>3</I>). In addition to the take-home lead contamination, the 
investigation identified deteriorated lead paint, which the landlord remediated. When the 
4-month-old infant's BLL remained elevated several months later, more thorough testing 
of painted surfaces was performed, and the landlord was required to 
remediate additional lead painted surfaces. The infant's BLL then decreased steadily.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
<P> Exposure to lead in paints and coatings is a known health risk, 
and recommendations have been made to prevent exposure 
(<I>4,5</I>). This investigation revealed that wood chemically stripped of lead-containing coatings can retain 
harmful amounts of lead. The process of alkaline stripping can cause lead to migrate from 
the paint layer into the pores of the wood substrate 
(<I>6</I>). Although the wood appears uncoated, sufficient airborne lead dust is released while using power and hand 
tools to cause surface contamination and elevated BLLs in workers 
(<I>7</I>).
</P><P>Employers in industries that sand or otherwise disturb lead-impregnated 
stripped wood (e.g., furniture refinishing and construction) may be unaware of the risk for 
lead exposure and therefore may not be taking adequate precautions. Public 
health agencies that address lead issues should send hazard alerts to trade associations 
and employers in the affected industries. The incident in this report illustrates 
that industries that handle chemically stripped wood need to comply with lead 
safety measures, including exposure assessment and control, provision of work clothing 
and shoes, good hygiene and workplace housekeeping practices, employee training, 
and medical surveillance. This incident also underscores that a thorough investigation of 
a childhood lead poisoning case should consider the occupations of adults in 
the household. Where take-home lead is suspected, BLL tests of the adults can help 
to confirm workplace exposure. Follow-up at the work- site, 
including screening of other workers and their young children, can identify others at risk.
