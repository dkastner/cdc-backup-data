</h3><P><I><b>Introduction:</b> In Kazakhstan, during 1995--2002, the annual notification rate per 100,000 population for new cases 
of tuberculosis (TB) increased from 67.1 to 165.1. Beginning in 1998, public health authorities have used the national 
case management strategy (DOTS) promulgated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to control TB. Intended goals 
of DOTS include achieving a cure rate of 
<U>&gt;</U>85% for persons with newly detected pulmonary TB 
sputum-smear--positive (PTB+) cases and having PTB+ represent 
<U>&gt;</U>65% of all PTB cases among adults. Surveillance data collected during 
2000--2002 were analyzed to evaluate progress toward achieving these goals and identify factors associated with specific 
treatment outcomes.
</P><P><b>Methods:</b> Surveillance data included the following nonidentifiable information on persons with newly reported cases 
of PTB: dates of disease onset and treatment initiation; methods of diagnosis; treatment outcomes; HIV status; and 
selected demographic, socioeconomic, and behavioral characteristics. Cure rates and proportions of PTB+ cases were calculated 
on the basis of the TB case definition and treatment outcome classification format outlined in DOTS guidelines issued 
by WHO. Denominator data to calculate rates were obtained from the National Census Office of Kazakhstan. 
Logistic regression was employed to investigate factors associated with treatment outcomes using Epi Info version 3.2.
</P><P><b>Results:</b> During 2000--2002, a total of 65,011 new cases of PTB were detected in Kazakhstan. The average 
annual countrywide notification rate per 100,000 population was 146.0; provincial notification rates varied (range: 
65.1--274.0). The countrywide cure rate for newly detected PTB+ was 72.2%; provincial rates varied (range: 65%--81%). 
Of 59,905 cases of PTB among adults during 2000--2002, a total of 26,804 (44.7%) were PTB+. Unfavorable 
treatment outcome of new PTB+ cases was associated with alcohol abuse, homelessness, and previous incarceration.
</P><P><b>Conclusion:</b> The cure rate for new PTB+ cases and the proportion of cases of PTB+ among all adults with PTB 
were below targeted goals. This might, in part, be explained by the 1998 adoption of DOTS. Improving program 
indicators requires evaluation of detection efforts, laboratory diagnostic capabilities, and adherence to treatment regimens, 
especially in provinces in which rates are high and among persons at high risk for unfavorable treatment outcomes.</I>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Introduction</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a national case management strategy (DOTS) to reduce 
the increasing global burden of tuberculosis (TB), especially in developing countries 
(<I>1</I>). The five elements of the DOTS strategy are sustainable government commitment, quality assurance of sputum microscopy, standardized short-course 
treatment (including direct observation of therapy), regular supply of drugs, and establishment of reporting and 
recording systems (<I>2,3</I>). The goal of DOTS is to reduce TB morbidity and mortality and the chance of 
<I>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</I> developing resistance to primary treatment drugs 
(<I>4</I>). Target goals of TB control adopted in 1991 by the 
World Health Assembly (<I>3</I>) include 
<U>&gt;</U>70% detection rate of the estimated incidence of sputum-smear--positive pulmonary 
TB (PTB+) and <U>&gt;</U>85% cure rate for newly detected 
PTB+ cases. The <U>&gt;</U>85% cure rate was adopted on the basis of 
accumulated experience in Africa and certain districts of China 
(<I>5,6</I>).
</P><P>Performance indicators in the DOTS program use the proportion detected of PTB+, which is the most infectious form 
of TB. PTB+ is associated with high mortality 
(<I>7</I>) and is the most effective form of TB to use for bacteriologic monitoring 
of 

treatment progress (<I>8</I>). The proportion of newly detected PTB+ cases among the total number of adults with PTB 
reflects the proper application of diagnostic criteria. In countries with a medium or high TB burden, when necessary laboratory 
resources are available and sputum smears for microscopy 
are taken from TB patients, PTB+ accounts for &gt;50% of all TB cases 
and &gt;65% of new PTB cases in adults (<I>3,9</I>). Achieving a high (i.e., 
<U>&gt;</U>85%) cure rate for PTB+ is a critical priority 
for TB-control programs (<I>3,9</I>). Failure to achieve this rate results in continued infectiousness and possible development 
of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB, which is resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin 
(<I>10,11</I>).
</P><P>During 1980--1994, the countrywide TB notification rate per 100,000 population decreased from 88.2 to 59.7. 
However, since 1995, notification rates have increased constantly, reaching 165.1 in 2002. TB mortality rates per 100,000 
population decreased from 17.2 in 1980 to 10.6 in 1991. During 1992--1998, mortality rates increased, reaching 38.4 in 1998; 
however, rates decreased to 24.2 in 2002 (Kazakhstan Ministry of Health [MoH], unpublished data, 1980--2002). 
Increased TB mortality and morbidity have been attributed to socioeconomic changes and the deterioration of the health-care system 
in Kazakhstan after the country gained its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991 
(<I>12,13</I>).
</P><P>To manage the increasing burden of TB in the country, in 1998, the Kazakhstan MoH adopted and implemented a 
new National Tuberculosis Program (NTP), whose objectives and target goals are in accord with the DOTS strategy 
(<I>14</I>). To implement the DOTS strategy in Kazakhstan, primary health-care physicians and TB specialists received training in 
case-detection policy, and laboratories were equipped with binocular microscopes. During 1997--2000, the number of 
sputum-smear examinations increased from 661,000 to 1,170,000 (Kazakhstan MoH, 
unpublished data, 2001).
</P><P>Since 1998, a uniform TB surveillance system has operated in Kazakhstan. Beginning in 2000, all administrative 
territories collected surveillance data. In 2003, CDC conducted a study to evaluate NTP performance. Annual data for 2000--2002 
were analyzed to describe patterns of PTB notification by person and place, assess progress toward achieving NTP target goals, 
and identify factors associated with unfavorable treatment outcomes.
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Methods</FONT></B>
</H3>
<H4>
<B>Study Design</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The MoH surveillance database in Kazakhstan was analyzed to estimate the PTB notification rate and describe 
NTP performance indicators that could be used to measure progress. Selection of appropriate progress indicators was guided 
by WHO recommendations (<I>15</I>). Two performance indicators were selected: the proportion of new PTB+ cases 
among reported cases of PTB among adults and the proportion of persons with newly detected PTB+ cases who were cured 
(<I>3</I>). Persons in the database, registered during 2000--2002, with new PTB+ cases for which records for DOTS treatment 
regimen were completed by the time of the study were treated as members of a cohort that was used to study 
associations between treatment outcome and risk factors. The study was given institutional review board approval by the Kazakh 
State Medial University ethics committee.
<H4>
<B>Study Definitions </B>
</H4>
</P><P>Diagnostic categories for newly reported cases of PTB (both PTB+ and sputum-smear--negative PTB) and 
treatment outcomes* for newly diagnosed PTB+ were defined in accordance with WHO guidelines 
(<I>3</I>). To study the associations among treatment outcome and risk factors, a new bi-level treatment outcome variable was defined on the basis of the DOTS 
outcome definitions: favorable (i.e., cured) and unfavorable (i.e., failed, died, or defaulted). Patients classified as having 
completed treatment or transferred out were excluded from the risk factor analysis because either information was 
lacking regarding alteration of sputum-smear status from positive to negative or they had been classified according to a new 
diagnostic category. Sociodemographic and behavioral variables in the surveillance database that were available for risk factor 
analysis included age, sex, place of residence, homelessness, employment status, employment in the medical profession, 
previous incarceration, and alcohol abuse. These variables were complete for &gt;95% of records. Data were recorded by 
treating physicians at the time of TB diagnosis (5--10 days after hospital admission) on the basis of information provided by patients.
<H4>
<B>Data Sources</B>
</H4>
</P><P>By law, TB is a reportable disease in Kazakhstan. A standard notification form is completed by the treating physician 
and then entered into an electronic database when a patient receives a TB diagnosis in any TB treatment facility. The 
national TB surveillance database contains nonidentified 
information on cases among civilians from all 16 administrative regions 
(14 provinces and two large urban areas [Astana and Almaty]); data on prisoners and military personnel are not included in 
this database. During 2000--2002, a total of 99,111 extrapulmonary and pulmonary cases were registered in the database; 
65,011 (65.6%) were newly diagnosed PTB cases that were used for the descriptive analysis. Of these, 803 (1.2%) persons 
were excluded from the analysis because of lack of data on bacterioscopic investigation. Of 27,171 persons in the database 
with newly diagnosed PTB+, complete outcome data were available for 20,461 (75.3%) persons and were used for the risk 
factor analysis. Of these, 285 (1.4%) were children aged &lt;15 years; because of these limited numbers, children were not included 
in the risk factor analysis. Population denominator data were obtained from the National Census Office of Kazakhstan.
<H4>
<B>Statistical Analyses</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Data analyses were performed using Epi Info, version 3.2 (CDC, Atlanta, Georgia). Population estimates at midpoint of 
the 2000--2002 study period were used to calculate the average annual notification rates for new PTB by sex, age, and 
region. Chi-square tests were used to evaluate differences in notification rates and estimated target indicators by region. 
Logistic regression analysis was used to study associations 
between the study-defined treatment outcome variable and sociodemographic 
and behavioral risk factors. All variables that were significant at the two-sided 
a = 0.05 level in univariate analyses were included in 
the final multivariate logistic model; adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were used as measures of association.

<H4>
<B>Descriptive Statistics</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During 2000--2002, the countrywide average annual PTB notification rate was 146 per 100,000 population. Rates in 
urban and rural areas were similar (146.1 and 144.9, respectively). However, rates differed significantly (p&lt;0.001) by 
region (range: 65.0 [Almaty City]--274.0 [Kzyl-Orda]). In general, the highest rates were observed in the country's western regions 
(Actobe, Atirau, Mangistau, and West Kazakhstan). Age-specific rate patterns were similar for men and women. The highest 
rates occurred among persons aged 25--34 years (men: 277; women: 241). Among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>25 years, rates were consistently higher for men than for women 
(<a href = "su5501a4.htm#fig">Figure</a>). By region, significant differences were reported in the proportion of 
sputum-smear--positive cases among adults with newly 
reported PTB cases (range: 34.5% [Astana]--59.6% [Northern 
Kazakhstan]) (p&lt;0.001) (<a href = "su5501a4.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>); no region attained 
the goal of <U>&gt;</U>65%. The cure rate for persons with new PTB+ cases varied (range: 
65% [Eastern Kazakhstan]--81% [Almaty City]) (p&lt;0.001) (<a href = "su5501a4.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). No region attained the goal of 
<U>&gt;</U>85%. Among 99,111 persons with TB, 100 (0.1%) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)--infected patients were identified during the study period.
<H4>
<B>Risk Factor Analysis</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Among 20,176 persons aged <U>&gt;</U>15 years, 547 (2.7%) patients had finished the treatment course but their 
sputum-smear status was unknown, and 650 (3.2%) patients were transferred out; both groups were excluded from the risk factor 
analysis. Of 18,979 patients included in the analysis, 4,422 (23.3%) had unfavorable treatment outcomes (i.e., died, failed, 
or defaulted). The proportion recorded as having an unfavorable outcome varied by age group. In univariate analyses, all 
studied variables were statistically significant at the 0.05 level and were included in the final multivariate logistic model. 
Unfavorable treatment outcomes for new PTB+ cases were associated with alcohol abuse, homelessness, previous 
incarceration, unemployment, being male, and urban residence. Being medical personnel was protective. AORs for unfavorable 
treatment outcomes  increased with age (<a href = "su5501a4.htm#tab3">Table 3</a>).
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">
<B><FONT COLOR="#0b3d91">Discussion</FONT></B>
</H3>
</P><P>The high countrywide notification rate of new PTB cases (146 per 100,000 population for the 
3-year study period) underscores the importance of controlling TB in Kazakhstan. Substantial 
regional differences were recorded; in certain areas 
(e.g., Kzyl-Orda, 274 per 100,000 population), the 
notification rate was approximately twice the national average. As 
in other countries, regional differences might result from different underlying socioeconomic conditions and the quality of 
the performance of local TB-control programs 
(<I>16,17</I>). Further research is needed to identify the reasons for regional 
differences, so corrective measures can be taken as needed.
</P><P>The age-specific notification rate of new PTB cases was similar for children aged &lt;15 years for both sexes. However, 
for persons aged <U>&gt;</U>15 years, notification rates were higher among males. Similar results have been reported in other countries 
(<I>18--20</I>). The reasons for this difference in TB notification rates are not known. No evidence exists that 
health-seeking behaviors are substantially different in countries of the former Soviet Union and could not have accounted for male-female 
differences. Genetic factors or transmission dynamics 
might explain this difference.
</P><P>During 2000--2002, the proportion of PTB+ cases among the total number of new PTB cases among adults in 
Kazakhstan was 44.7% (program target: <U>&gt;</U>65%). In certain 
areas, the proportion was lower (e.g., Astana-City: 34.5%; South 
Kazakhstan: 37.2%). The DOTS strategy was adopted recently (i.e., in 1998), and the quality of laboratory services and the application 
of the diagnostic criteria might not be up to the required standard, especially in certain areas.
</P><P>Since the DOTS strategy was implemented, the supply of primary TB drugs in TB-treatment facilities has been 
adequate; consequently, this factor cannot explain the low cure rate for new PTB+ cases, especially in certain regions (e.g., East 
Kazakhstan and Pavlodar, both 65%). Data were not available 
to explore reasons for the low cure rate (e.g., the prevalence of MDR-TB). 
The single study available indicated that high (14.2%) MDR-TB rates among new TB patients in Kazakhstan might contribute to 
a low cure rate in the country (<I>21</I>).
</P><P>Unemployment and urban place of residence were highly prevalent (&gt;54%) in the study group and associated 
with unfavorable treatment outcomes; this could have contributed to the low cure rate. Other factors (i.e., homelessness, history 
of incarceration, alcohol abuse, and age 
<U>&gt;</U>55 years) had more effect on the unfavorable treatment outcome; however, their 
overall effect on the cure rate might have been limited 
because of low prevalence.
</P><P>Among medical personnel, the protective odds ratio for 
unfavorable treatment outcome (AOR = 0.6) might be 
explained by their stricter adherence to treatment regimen. The high percentage of unfavorable treatment outcomes among persons aged 
<U>&gt;</U>55 years was attributable to deaths from any cause; however, among persons in other age groups, the majority of unfavorable treatment 
outcomes were attributable to treatment failure.
</P><P>Kazakhstan is in the beginning stage of an HIV epidemic. During 2000--2002, a total of 100 (0.1%) cases of HIV were 
identified among 99,111 persons with TB. The contribution of HIV infection to the TB burden is believed to be insubstantial.
</P><P>The findings in this report are subject to at least one limitation. All study factors were measured by the treating 
physicians on the basis of patient self-reports. Patients might not have reported certain behaviors, particularly those regarded as 
socially unacceptable (e.g., alcohol abuse). As a result, the low prevalence of these behaviors among TB patients and their 
consequent low overall impact on the cure rate might reflect inaccurate self-reporting.
</P><P>Continued evaluation is needed to improve performance of the TB program in Kazakhstan. Improving program 
indicators requires evaluation of detection efforts, laboratory diagnostic 
capabilities, and adherence to treatment regimens, especially 
in provinces where rates are high and among persons at high risk for unfavorable treatment outcomes, so recommendations 
for improvement can be offered as needed. In addition, laboratory quality control and quality assurance for TB culture should be 
further implemented in the country to assist in assessing 
the impact of MDR TB on the cure rate of PTB patients.
