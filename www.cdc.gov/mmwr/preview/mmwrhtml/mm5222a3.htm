<H1>Progress Toward Poliomyelitis Eradication --- Southern Africa, 
2001--March 2003</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Since the 1988 World Health Assembly resolution to eradicate poliomyelitis globally, substantial progress has been made 

in all World Health Organization (WHO) regions, and three regions (Americas, European, and Western Pacific) are classified 
as polio-free (<I>1,<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5216a4.htm">2</a></I>). The African Region comprises four epidemiologic blocks (Central, Eastern, Southern, and Western). The Southern African block comprises 14 countries --- 10 on the mainland (Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, 

Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe) and four in the Indian Ocean (Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Seychelles) --- with a combined total population in 2002 of approximately 120 million persons. This report summarizes polio eradication efforts in the Southern African block during January 2001--March 2003, which indicate the possible interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission and underscore the need to sustain 
polio eradication efforts.
<H4>
<B>Routine Vaccination</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During 2001, coverage with 3 doses of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) was estimated at &gt;90% in two countries 
(Mauritius and Seychelles), at 80%--89% in four countries (Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, and South Africa), and at 70%--79% in five 

countries (Comoros, Mozambique, Swaziland, Zambia, and Zimbabwe). Coverage was lowest (&lt;70%) in three 
countries: Namibia (64%), Madagascar (58%), and Angola (44%) 
(<I>3</I>).
<H4>
<B>Supplementary Immunization Activities</B>
</H4>
</P><P>During 1996--2000, all countries in the Southern African block conducted supplementary immunization activities 
(SIAs) with OPV during <U>&gt;</U>2 years (<a href = "mm5222a3.htm#tab1">Table 1</a>). SIAs consisted of two rounds of National Immunization Days (NIDs)* in the winter (May--September), targeting children aged 
<U>&lt;</U>59 months. Angola, Namibia, and Zambia continued annual NIDs 
through 2002 because of WPV transmission in Angola and cross-border transmission in western Zambia. After having 

discontinued NIDs for 3 years, Madagascar resumed conducting NIDs in 2002 after a polio outbreak caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV).
</P><P>During 2001--2002, SIA quality improved substantially through more detailed microplanning (i.e., planning at the 
district level), house-to-house vaccination, intensified supervision of house-to-house vaccination teams, and separate tallying of children who never had received OPV. During the first round of NIDs in Madagascar in September 2002, of 
the approximately 3.7 million children aged &lt;5 years who were vaccinated, approximately 492,000 (15%) never had 
received OPV. Analysis of the distribution of these children enabled the Ministry of Health to determine which geographic areas to focus on to improve routine vaccination. In 2002, SIAs were coordinated among countries inside and outside the 

Southern African block, and NIDs in Angola and Namibia were synchronized with SIAs in the Democratic Republic of Congo and selected countries of the Central African block. Angola plans to conduct additional NIDs in June and August 2003. <H4>
<B>Incidence of Polio</B>
</H4>
</P><P>Countries of the Southern African block with the most 

recent isolation of WPV from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) 
cases include Zambia (2002, two cases imported from Angola), Angola (2001, one case), Madagascar (1997, one case), 
and Namibia (1995, at least eight cases) (<a href="mm5222a3.htm#tab1">Tables 1</a> and 
      <a href="mm5222a3.htm#tab2">2</a>). In the other countries of the Southern African block, WPV was last isolated in 1993 or earlier. In Madagascar, a polio outbreak 
related to cVDPV during 2001--2002 was detected 

and controlled after NIDs were conducted during 
September--October 2002 (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5128a5.htm">4</a></I>).
<H4>
<B>AFP Surveillance</B>
</H4>
</P><P>The goal of AFP surveillance is to detect circulating polioviruses and provide data for developing 
appropriate supplementary vaccination strategies. AFP surveillance quality is evaluated by two key indicators: sensitivity of 
reporting (target: nonpolio AFP rate of 
<U>&gt;</U>1 case per 100,000 children aged &lt;15 years) and completeness of specimen collection 
(target: two adequate stool 
specimens<SUP>&#134;</SUP> from <U>&gt;</U>80% of persons with AFP). All countries of the Southern African block 
except Madagascar and Mozambique have achieved a level of AFP surveillance that allows use of virologic case classification 
criteria (i.e., annual adequate specimens collected from 
<U>&gt;</U>60% of persons with AFP) (<I>5</I>). Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, 
and South Africa have not yet achieved certification-quality AFP surveillance (adequate specimens from 
<U>&gt;</U>80% of persons with AFP) in any year (<a href = "mm5222a3.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). Analysis of AFP performance indicators at the subnational level indicates considerable surveillance deficiencies at the provincial and district level. During January--March 2003, surveillance performance in Southern 
African block countries continued to improve, especially 

in Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, and Swaziland. Performance decreased substantially in Angola (<a href = "mm5222a3.htm#tab2">Table 2</a>). <H4>
<B>Regional Laboratory Network</B>
</H4>

</P><P>The polio laboratory network in the Southern African block consists of four laboratories: one each in Madagascar, 
Zambia (which also serves Tanzania), Zimbabwe (which also serves Malawi), and South Africa (a regional reference laboratory 
that serves the remaining countries in the block and countries in other blocks). During 2002, network laboratories 
processed 2,114 samples from 1,088 persons with AFP with paralysis onset (South Africa, 571 cases; Zambia, 277 cases [including 
144 samples from Tanzania]; Zimbabwe, 182 cases; and Madagascar, 58 cases). The nonpolio enterovirus (NPEV) isolation 
rate (target: <U>&gt;</U>10% of stool specimens with NPEV isolation) serves as a combined indicator of specimen quality (i.e., quality of the reverse cold chain for specimen transport) and laboratory sensitivity. For the eight countries that reported an NPEV 
isolation 

rate, the rate ranged from 0 to 44%. Angola, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, and South Africa all reported 
NPEV isolation rates of &gt;10%.
<H4>
<B>Certification and Laboratory Containment of Poliovirus</B>
</H4>
</P><P>All countries in the Southern African block except Namibia have established National Polio Expert Committees 
(NPECs) comprising experts who make the final classification of AFP cases as confirmed polio, polio-compatible, or nonpolio AFP. 
All countries have National Committees for the Certification of Polio Eradication (NCCs) comprising independent experts 
who work closely with the African Regional Certification Commission (ARCC) to achieve the eventual polio-free certification 
of the region. Although NPECs exist in the majority of countries of the Southern African block, delays in AFP case 

classification have occurred, with large numbers of AFP cases pending final classification for approximately 6 months; as of December 2002, a total of 283 persons with AFP with paralysis onset during 2002 had not been classified. In 2002, a total of 13 AFP cases were classified as polio-compatible (nine from Angola and four from South Africa). No clusters of 
polio-compatible cases were found.
</P><P>NCCs in all Southern African block countries have begun to submit annual country progress reports on polio 

eradication to the ARCC. After &gt;3 years of certification-quality AFP surveillance without detecting WPV, Malawi is one of the first eight countries in the African Region selected by ARCC to begin submitting final national documentation 
toward eventual certification in 2003. Efforts toward the eventual laboratory containment of WPVs also have begun, with the designation of national task forces (NTFs) for laboratory containment in Angola, Botswana, Madagascar, Malawi, Namibia, South 
Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe. Lesotho and Zambia are in the process of establishing NTFs.

</P><P><b>Editorial Note.</b> The last reported cases of polio confirmed with isolation of WPV in the Southern African block were observed in Zambia in February 2002. During January 2001--March 2003, WPV was isolated only in Angola and Zambia, and AFP surveillance quality improved in several countries, most notably in Angola, which had faced enormous 
challenges because of war (<I><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4920a4.htm">6</a></I>). However, the decline in surveillance performance in Angola during January--March 2003 demonstrates the fragile nature of surveillance in this country, and steps have been taken to ensure that surveillance quality will 

rebound rapidly.
</P><P>Although transmission of indigenous WPV in the Southern African block might have been interrupted, the possibility of ongoing transmission of WPV in the Southern African block cannot be excluded despite improved AFP surveillance in 
several countries (particularly Madagascar, Mozambique, and South Africa) and the absence of reports of AFP cases in many areas (particularly in eastern Angola).
</P><P>AFP surveillance quality in all countries of the Southern African block should be improved to ensure that inadequate AFP surveillance does not delay eradication and the eventual polio-free certification of the African Region. During 2002, an external surveillance review, an important tool to assess both the organization and performance of surveillance, was conducted in Angola, and reviews are planned in 2003 for Madagascar, Mozambique, and South Africa. In addition, the 
country technical advisory group for Angola will convene in June to review the polio eradication initiative in this country, monitor the implementation of the recommendations resulting from the 2002 surveillance review, and offer advice on 
further strengthening of surveillance and the need for SIAs 
(<I>7</I>).
</P><P>The formation of functional NPECs and NCCs in the majority of countries indicates that progress is being made 

toward achieving certification. However, further political commitment to accelerate the implementation of key polio-eradication strategies, including all aspects of AFP surveillance, is needed in all countries in the Southern African block, particularly those that have not yet achieved certification-quality surveillance.
</P><P>Support for the polio eradication initiative in Southern 

Africa has been provided primarily by WHO member states, 
the Netherlands, the United States, the United Kingdom, Rotary International, and CDC. For polio eradication activities in 
these countries to be sustained until global certification is achieved, additional funding will be required. Through 
national Expanded Program on Immunization Interagency Coordination Committees, polio 
eradication partners should explore opportunities to raise funds from government and local partner agencies to support some activities. Strengthening polio 

eradication strategies in Southern Africa will prevent importation and circulation of polioviruses until global polio 
eradication is certified.
