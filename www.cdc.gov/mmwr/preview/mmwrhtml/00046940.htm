<h1>Salmonella Serotype Montevideo Infections Associated with Chicks
-- Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, Spring 1995 and 1996 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>During 1995 and 1996, public health laboratories in Idaho,
Washington, and Oregon identified clusters of infections with
Salmonella serotype Montevideo. Epidemiologic investigations,
including enhanced surveillance, of these clusters indicated
association with exposure to chicks. This report summarizes the
findings of these investigations, which suggest that handling
chicks is a health risk, especially for children; consequently,
thorough handwashing is recommended after handling of chicks. </p>
<p>Idaho and Washington </p>
<p>During April 1-May 31, 1995, the public health laboratories
of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare (IDHW) and the
Washington Department of Health (WDH) identified three and nine
S. Montevideo isolates, respectively, compared with annual
averages of less than 1 and 20 during 1984-1994. In April and May
1996, a total of 11 S. Montevideo isolates were reported in
Washington. For this investigation, a case was defined as
culture-confirmed S. Montevideo infection in an Idaho or
Washington resident with onset of illness during April 1-May 31
in 1995 or 1996; illness in all 23 persons met the case
definition. Of the 23 case-patients, 12 (52%) were aged less than
or equal to 2 years; of these, five (42%) were aged less than or
equal to 6 months. An isolate obtained from a child aged 14
months was cultured from blood, indicating invasive disease.
Three (13%) case-patients were hospitalized. </p>
<p>To identify exposures associated with illness, IDHW and WDH
conducted a case-control study in 1995 and 1996. Twenty-two of
the 23 persons with illness meeting the case definition were
included in the study. Two controls (i.e., persons reporting no
diarrheal illness during the referent period) were matched to
each case-patient by age and neighborhood. Of 22 case-patients,
17 (77%) had exposure to chicks during the week before illness
onset, compared with four (9%) of 44 controls (matched odds
ratio=29.3; 95% confidence interval {CI}=4.6-1243.2). </p>
<p>The chicks associated with the 17 case-patients who reported
such exposure were purchased in at least four different counties
in 1995 and at least six different counties in 1996. No common
hatchery, place of purchase, or feed sources were identified.
Fecal samples were obtained from two chicks associated with two
geographically separated case-patients; S. Montevideo was
isolated from each. </p>
<p>Isolates from the seven Washington patients who had chick
exposure in 1995 and from the seven Washington patients who had
chick exposure in 1996 and two chicks were subtyped by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The patterns differed in
1995 and 1996. However, for the 1995 isolates, the patterns from
five isolates were indistinguishable, and for the 1996 isolates,
the patterns from five of the human isolates and the two chick
isolates were indistinguishable. </p>
<p>Oregon </p>
<p>During March-June 1996, the Oregon State Public Health
Laboratory identified 16 cases of S. Montevideo, compared with an
annual average of nine cases during 1984-1995. For this
investigation, a case was defined as culture-confirmed S.
Montevideo infection in an Oregon resident with illness onset
during April 1-June 30. Illness in all 16 persons met the case
definition. The median age of case-patients was 32 years (range:
5 months-81 years); three (19%) were aged less than or equal to
2 years; of these, two (67%) were aged less than or equal to 6
months. Two (13%) case-patients were hospitalized. </p>
<p>To identify exposures associated with illness, the State
Health Division, Oregon Department of Human Resources, began a
case-control study by reviewing salmonellosis case-report forms.
Eleven of the 16 case-patients were included in the study.
Controls were selected from among culture-confirmed cases of
Salmonella infection other than S. Montevideo identified during
the same period from counties reporting S. Montevideo cases.
Nineteen controls were selected with a median age of 22 years
(range: 9 months-80 years). Seven (64%) of 11 persons with S.
Montevideo infection compared with one (5%) of 19 persons with
other Salmonella infections had handled live poultry (chicks,
hens, or roosters) during the 5 days before illness onset (odds
ratio=31.5; 95% CI=2.5-1494.5). Fecal samples were obtained from
five poultry, including two chicks, associated with two
case-patients; S. Montevideo was isolated from the two chicks
obtained from one of the case-patients. No common hatchery, place
of purchase, or feed sources were identified among poultry
associated with different case-patients. </p>
<p>S. Montevideo isolates were available from five of the seven
patients who reported handling live poultry. Among these five
isolates, two PFGE patterns were identified. The pattern for four
of these isolates and the two chick isolates were
indistinguishable; this pattern also was indistinguishable from
the pattern identified in the five human and two chick isolates
in Washington in 1996. The two culture-positive chicks in Oregon
had been purchased from the same hatchery as one of the
culture-positive chicks in Washington. </p>

<p>Editorial Note: Salmonella infections occur in an estimated 2-4
million persons each year in the United States; of these,
approximately 40,000 are culture-confirmed and reported to CDC by
state health departments (1). Most human Salmonella infections
are foodborne, but when contact with pets has been implicated,
reptiles have been a common source (2,3). Molecular subtyping
techniques (e.g., PFGE) are valuable tools in epidemiologic
investigations because they can link geographically dispersed
cases and small clusters of cases to a common source. </p>
<p>The proportion of all salmonellosis cases associated with
exposure to chicks and ducklings is unknown; however, previous
reports document transmission of Salmonella from these small fowl
to humans (4-7). Many of these outbreaks have occurred during the
spring, particularly around Easter. Children may be at greater
risk for salmonellosis from these pet or farmyard fowl because of
more frequent receipt of fowl as gifts, less frequent handwashing
after handling, and more frequent hand-to-mouth contact. In
addition, infants with salmonellosis may be at greater risk for
developing invasive disease (8). </p>
<p>Previous reports of chick- and duckling-associated
salmonellosis have resulted in statewide legislation restricting
the sale of these baby fowl as pets, such as in Maryland in 1967
(9). However, these regulations are difficult to enforce and the
effectiveness of such legislation is unknown. Interstate
transport and sale of pet baby turtles were banned in 1975 by the
Food and Drug Administration to prevent turtle-associated
salmonellosis (10). The likelihood of transmission of Salmonella
from pet or farmyard chicks and ducklings can be reduced by
avoiding contact with feces from these animals and carefully
washing hands with soap and water after handling either chicks,
ducklings, or anything that has had contact with these fowl. In
addition, persons who, if infected with Salmonella, may be at
increased risk for illness (e.g., infants, immunocompromised
persons, or the elderly) should consider limiting their exposure
to these fowl. Chicks and ducklings may not be appropriate pets
for children. During investigations of Salmonella infections,
especially during the spring and Easter seasons, health-care
workers and public health personnel should consider contact with
chicks and ducklings as a potential risk factor for
salmonellosis. </p>
