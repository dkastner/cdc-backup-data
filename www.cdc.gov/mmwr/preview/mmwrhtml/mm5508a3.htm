<H1>Deaths Associated with Hypocalcemia from Chelation Therapy --- 
Texas, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, 2003--2005</FONT></H1>
</P><P>Chelating agents bind lead in soft tissues and are used in the treatment of lead poisoning to enhance urinary and 
biliary excretion of lead, thus decreasing total lead levels in the body 
(<I>1</I>). During the past 30 years, environmental 
and dietary exposures to lead have decreased substantially, resulting in a considerable decrease in population blood lead 
levels (BLLs) (<I><a href="mm5420a5.htm">2</a></I>) and a corresponding decrease in the number of patients requiring chelation therapy. Chelating agents also 
increase excretion of other heavy metals and minerals, such as zinc and, in certain cases, calcium 
(<I>1</I>). This report describes three deaths associated with chelation-therapy--related 
hypocalcemia that resulted in cardiac arrest. Several drugs are used in the 
treatment of lead poisoning, including edetate disodium 
calcium (CaEDTA), dimercaperol (British anti-Lewisite), D-penicillamine, 
and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (succimer). Health-care providers who are unfamiliar with chelating agents and 
are considering this treatment for lead poisoning should consult an expert in the chemotherapy of lead poisoning. 
Hospital pharmacies should evaluate whether continued stocking of 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA is necessary, given the established 
risk for hypocalcemia, the availability of less toxic alternatives, and an ongoing safety review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
Health-care providers and pharmacists should ensure that 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA is not administered to children during chelation therapy.
</P><P>Chelating agents, especially those intended for use in children, should be effective in reducing lead and other heavy 
metals from the body without producing substantial adverse effects on levels of critical serum electrolytes, such as calcium. The 
only agent recommended for intravenous (IV) chelation therapy for children is CaEDTA 
(<I>1</I>). However, hospital formularies usually stock multiple chelation agents. One such agent, 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA, was formerly used for treatment of hypercalcemia, but its use 
has become infrequent because of concerns regarding nephrotoxicity and because of the availability of less toxic alternatives 
(<I>3</I>). Furthermore, Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA contains a warning stating, &quot;The use of this drug in any particular patient is recommended 
only when the severity of the clinical condition justifies the aggressive measures associated with this type of 
therapy.&quot;<B> </B>According to the package insert, 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA is &quot;indicated in selected patients for the emergency treatment of hypercalcemia and for 
the control of ventricular arrhythmias associated with digitalis toxicity.&quot; According to FDA and CDC, the safety and 
effectiveness 

of Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA in pediatric patients has not been established, and its use is not recommended because it induces 
hypocalcemia and possibly fatal tetany (<I>1</I>).
</P><P>In 2005<B>,</B> the Texas Department of Health childhood lead poisoning surveillance program reported a death attributable 
to chelation-associated hypocalcemia to CDC. Subsequently, CDC queried state and local lead-surveillance 
programs regarding chelation-related fatalities; additional deaths were identified in Pennsylvania and Oregon.
<H4>
<B>Case Reports</B>
</H4>
</P><P><b>Texas.</b><I> </I>In February 2005, a girl aged 2 years who was tested for blood lead during routine health surveillance had a 
capillary BLL of 47 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL. A venous BLL of 48 
<I>&#181;</I>g/dL obtained 12 days later confirmed the elevated BLL. A complete blood count 
and iron study conducted concurrently revealed low serum iron levels and borderline anemia. On February 28, 2005, the girl 
was admitted to a local medical center for combined 
oral and IV chelation therapy.
</P><P>The patient's blood electrolytes at admission were within normal limits. Initial medication orders included IV 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA and oral succimer (an agent primarily used for treatment of lead poisoning). The medication order subsequently was 
corrected by the pediatric resident to IV CaEDTA. At 4:00 p.m. on the day of admission, the patient received her first dose of 
IV CaEDTA (300 mg in 100 mL normal saline at 25 mL/hr). At 4:35 p.m., she was administered 200 mg of oral succimer. 
Her vital signs remained normal throughout the night. At 4:00 a.m. the next day, a dose of IV 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA (instead of IV CaEDTA) was administered. An hour later, the patient's 
serum calcium had decreased to 5.2 mg/dL (normal value for pediatric 
patients: 8.5--10.5 mg/dL). At 7:05 a.m., the child's mother noticed that the child was limp and not breathing. Bedside procedures 
did not restore a normal cardiac rhythm, and a cardiac resuscitation code was called at 7:25 a.m. The child had no palpable 
pulse or audible heartbeat. Repeat laboratory values for serum drawn at 7:55 a.m. indicated that the serum calcium level was 
&lt;5.0 mg/dL despite repeated doses of calcium chloride. All attempts at resuscitation failed, and the girl was pronounced dead 
at 8:12 a.m.
</P><P>An autopsy revealed no results of toxicologic significance. A postmortem radiologic bone survey indicated areas of 
sclerosis at the metaphyses (growth arrest and recovery lines compatible with lead exposure). The cause of death was recorded as 
sudden cardiac arrest resulting from hypocalcemia associated with chelation therapy. The hospital's child mortality 
review board findings indicated that a dose of IV 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA was unintentionally administered to the child.
</P><P><b>Pennsylvania.</b> In August 2005, a boy aged 5 years with autism died while receiving IV chelation therapy with 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA in a physician's office.<B> 
</B>During the chelation procedure, the mother noted that the child was limp. The physician 
initiated resuscitation, and an emergency services team transported the child to the hospital. At the emergency 
department (ED), further resuscitation was attempted, including administration of at least 1 and possibly 2 doses of IV calcium 
chloride. Subsequently, the boy's blood calcium level was recorded in the ED as 6.9 mg/dL. The child did not 
regain consciousness. The coroner examination indicated cause of death as diffuse, acute cerebral hypoxic-ischemic injury, secondary to 
diffuse subendocardial necrosis. The myocardial necrosis resulted from 
hypocalcemia associated with administration of 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA. The case is under investigation by the Pennsylvania State Board of Medicine.
</P><P><B>Oregon</B>. In August 2003, a woman aged 53 years with no evidence of coronary artery disease, intracranial disease, or 
injury was treated with 700 mg IV EDTA in a naturopathic practitioner's clinic. The EDTA was provided by a 
compounding laboratory (Creative Compounding, Wilsonville, Oregon) and was administered by the practitioner to remove heavy 
metals from the body. The practitioner had provided a similar treatment to the patient on three previous occasions, once in 
June 2003 and twice in July 2003. Approximately 10--15 minutes after treatment began, the patient became 
unconscious. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated, and an emergency services team was contacted. Attempts to revive the 
patient en route to and in the ED were unsuccessful. The medical examiner determined the cause of death to be cardiac 
arrhythmia resulting from hypocalcemia associated with EDTA infusion and vascuolar cardiomyopathy. The patient's ionized 
calcium level during code was 3.8 mg/dL (normal value for adult 
patients: 4.5--5.3 mg/dL) after one IV injection of 
calcium gluconate administered by emergency medical 
technicians en route to the hospital and another IV injection of calcium chloride in 
the ED. The Oregon State Naturopath Licensing Board is conducting an investigation to determine whether 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA or CaEDTA was administered to this patient.
</P><P>The cases described in this report have been reported to FDA. FDA is performing a safety assessment of 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA, including a review of the adverse event reporting system to determine whether other deaths related to use of chelating 
agents have been reported.

<H3>Editorial Note:</H3>
</P><P><B> </B>Both children and adults are subject to 
potentially lethal prescription errors involving &quot;look-alike, 
sound-alike&quot; substitutions (i.e., confusion of drugs with similar names). In a 1-year study of errors in a tertiary care teaching 
hospital, 11.4% of medication errors were found to have resulted from use of the wrong drug name, dosage form, or abbreviation 
(<I>4</I>). A review of medical records in the Texas case described in this report revealed that the brand names for the 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA product, 
Endrate<SUP>&#174;</SUP> (Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, Illinois), and the CaEDTA product, Calcium Disodium 
Versenate<SUP>&#174;</SUP> (3M Pharmaceuticals, St. Paul, Minnesota), were used interchangeably; this improper use of drug names likely resulted in 
the inappropriate administration of Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA.
</P><P>Although CaEDTA and succimer were ordered for one 
patient and the form<B> </B>of EDTA administered to 
another remains under investigation, these drugs singly or in combination probably were not responsible for the low calcium 
levels.<B> </B>Hypercalcemia as a result of IV administration of CaEDTA has been reported 
(<I>5</I>). Succimer by itself is a weak calcium 
binder but is not associated with a drop in essential minerals such as calcium 
(<I>6</I>). Moreover, the reported doses of CaEDTA 
and succimer in the Texas case were appropriate and within established safety limits.
</P><P>Medical center records and coroner reports indicate that 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA was administered in at least two of the cases. 
Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA is often part of a standard hospital formulary; however, it should never be used for treating lead or other heavy 
metal poisoning in children because it induces hypocalcemia, which can lead to tetany and death 
(<I>7</I>). The error that caused the death in Texas most likely resulted from miscommunication between the pharmacy and the pediatric unit.
</P><P>Chelation therapy with CaEDTA, dimercaperol, or succimer has been the mainstay of medical management for 
children with BLLs <U>&gt;</U>45 <I>&#181;</I>g/dL 
(<I>1</I>). The effectiveness of chelation therapy in 
improving renal or nervous system symptoms of 
chronic mercury toxicity has not been established. Nonetheless, certain health-care practitioners have used chelation therapy 
for autism in the belief that mercury or other heavy metals are producing the symptoms 
(<I>8</I>). Other practitioners have recommended chelation therapy for treatment of coronary 
artery disease, hoping to eliminate calcified atherosclerotic 
plaques that can lead to coronary artery occlusions and myocardial infarctions. These off-label uses of chelation therapy are 
not supported by accepted scientific evidence. The Institute of Medicine found no scientific evidence that chelation is an 
effective therapy for autism spectrum disorder 
(<I>8</I>). Because limited consistent data exist on the use of chelation therapy to 
treat coronary artery disease, a clinical trial to 
assess the safety and effectiveness of chelation therapy is being conducted by 
the National Institutes of Health.*
</P><P>Deaths associated with lead poisoning are rare 
(<I>9</I>), and childhood deaths caused by cardiac arrest associated with 
chelation therapy have not been documented previously 
(<I>9</I>). As BLLs among children in the United States continue to 
decline (<I><a href="mm5420a5.htm">2</a></I>), fewer children require chelation therapy. Primary care providers should consult experts in the chemotherapy of lead before 
using chelation drug therapy. If such an expert is not available, primary care providers should contact state or local childhood 
lead poisoning prevention programs or the Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch of the National Center for Environmental 
Health, CDC.
</P><P>CDC and its state and local partners will continue to educate health-care providers and pharmacists to ensure 
that Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA is never administered to children during chelation therapy. CDC recommends that hospital pharmacies 
evaluate the need to keep Na<SUB>2</SUB>EDTA in their formularies. Case reports of cardiac arrest or symptoms of hypocalcemia during 
chelation therapy should<B> </B>be reported to the CDC Lead Poisoning Prevention Branch (770-488-3300) or to MedWatch, the 
FDA adverse event reporting system, at <a href="http://www.fda.gov/medwatch">http://www.fda.gov/medwatch</a>.
