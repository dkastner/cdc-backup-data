<h1>Epidemic Typhoid Fever -- Dushanbe, Tajikistan, 1997 </h1></a>	
<!-- content area --> 


	  	  


<p>Typhoid fever, a severe systemic illness transmitted through
 food or
water, is caused by the bacterium Salmonella serotype Typhi (1).
 This
report describes a major epidemic of typhoid fever in Dushanbe,
 Tajikistan
(<a href="00054823.htm#00001788.gif">Figure_1</a>), that resulted from contamination of the municipal
 water
system. </p>
<p>In Tajikistan, the Sanitary Epidemiologic Service (SES)
 maintains
records for reportable diseases (2). Dushanbe (1997 population:
 600,000)
residents receive health care through assigned polyclinics;
 surveillance
for reportable diseases is based on polyclinic records. A case of
 typhoid
fever is defined as physician diagnosis or isolation of S. Typhi
 from
stool, blood, or urine cultures. In February 1997, a sudden
 increase in the
number of typhoid fever cases was identified by SES in Dushanbe,
 with
approximately 2000 cases registered during a 2-week period. In
 March, the
Ministry of Health of Tajikistan requested assistance from CDC. In
collaboration with local authorities and nongovernmental partners,
 CDC
reviewed epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance; conducted a
case-control study to identify risk factors for infection; and
 evaluated
municipal drinking water quality, water wastage, and
 health-education
campaigns. </p>
<p>Of 10,766 cases of typhoid fever reported to SES during
 January
1996-July 1997, 8901 cases (2659 {30%} confirmed) and 95 deaths
(case-fatality rate: 1.1%) occurred during January-June 1997
(<a href="00054823.htm#00001789.gif">Figure_2</a>). The monthly typhoid fever incidence peaked at 570
 per
100,000 population during February and decreased to 93 in June.
 Median
patient age was 16 years (range less than 1-80 years); 50% were
 female. </p>
<p>The microbiology laboratory of City Hospital Number 2
 monitored
antimicrobial resistance during the epidemic. Of 56 isolates at
 that
hospital from January through March 1997, 52 (93%) were resistant
 to
chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,
antimicrobial agents used traditionally as first-line therapy for
 treatment
of typhoid fever. On additional testing at CDC, 79% of the isolates
 also
were resistant to nalidixic acid; none were resistant to
 ciporfloxacin. </p>
<p>CDC and SES conducted a case-control study to determine risk
 factors
for developing typhoid fever. Using a written questionnaire, SES
interviewed 43 culture-positive patients or their parents and 123
age-matched, neighborhood controls. Illness was associated with
 drinking
unboiled water in the 30 days before onset (matched odds ratio
 {MOR}=6.5;
95% confidence interval {CI}=3.0-24.0), obtaining drinking water
 from a tap
outside the home (MOR=9.1; 95% CI=1.6-82.0), and eating food from a
 street
vendor (MOR=2.9; 95% CI=1.4-7.2). On multivariate conditional
 logistic
regression analysis, drinking unboiled water (MOR=9.6; 95%
 CI=2.7-34.0) and
obtaining water from an outside tap (MOR=16.7; 95% CI=2.0-138.0)
 were
significantly associated with illness. Routinely boiling water in
 one's
home for drinking was protective (MOR=0.2; 95% CI=0.05-0.5). </p>
<p>Municipal drinking water in Dushanbe is supplied by two
 surface water
(Varzob River) and two ground water treatment plants. On inspection
 of the
surface water treatment plants in March 1997, sedimentation basins
 and
filters were full of silt, rendering them ineffective at removing
 solids
and biological contaminants from river water. Finished water
 samples
obtained before distribution from both surface treatment plants
 during
March 22-April 7 revealed concentrations of 100-200 colony forming
 units
(CFU) of fecal (thermotolerant) coliform bacteria per 100 mL. Water
 leaving
the treatment plants entered an interconnected distribution system
 where
surface and ground water blended. In the distribution system, the
 average
concentration of fecal coliform bacteria in water, adjusted for the

proportion of water supplied by each plant, was approximately 60
 CFU per
100 mL. World Health Organization guidelines for potable water
 require less
than 1 CFU per 100 mL (3). </p>
<p>To evaluate further municipal water quality, water samples
 were
collected from taps in randomly selected 1 hectare areas in
 Dushanbe. Fecal
coliform bacteria were detected in 26 of 27 household tap water
 samples
tested (mean=175 CFU per 100 mL; range: 4-greater than 400 CFU per
 100 mL).
Although water leaving the surface water treatment plants was
 fecally
contaminated, higher colony counts at taps suggested that further
contamination occurred within the distribution system. Water
 distribution
pipes were frequently located in open storm channels that also
 contained
wastewater runoff. Low water pressure in the distribution system
contributed to cross-contamination of drinking water with
 wastewater. To
determine how pressure in the municipal water system could be
 increased,
investigators measured water wastage from open and broken taps and
 pipes in
randomly selected Dushanbe neighborhoods. Average water wastage was

estimated to be 1040 liters per person per day. </p>
<p>Chlorination of the municipal water supply ceased in December
 1996,
when chlorine supplies were exhausted, and resumed in April 1997,
 after
international relief organizations provided chlorine to the water
 utility.
After chlorination resumed, free chlorine residuals were monitored
 at the
treatment plants and in tap water samples at 14 randomly selected
 sites
during June 24-August 15, 1997. Free chlorine residuals in 30% of
 tap water
samples tested remained below the targeted goal of 0.2 mg/L set by
 the
water utility and international relief organizations. Follow-up
 testing in
March 1998 revealed adequate chlorine residuals in tap water
 throughout the
city. </p>
<p>To control the epidemic, local authorities and nongovernmental

organizations initiated public information campaigns for water
 conservation
and typhoid fever prevention in June 1997. In August, 200 randomly
 selected
households in Dushanbe were surveyed to assess knowledge,
 attitudes, and
practices regarding these issues. Ninety-one percent of respondents

reported having heard or read the campaign messages and having
 altered some
of their behaviors. However, 51% of those surveyed reported they
 still
drank unboiled water because they perceived municipal water to be
 safe.
Repeated surveys indicate that after water conservation campaigns
 were
initiated, water wastage in Dushanbe decreased by approximately
 half. These
savings have enabled Dushanbe's water utility to plan closure of
 its
largest surface water treatment plant, thus providing a larger
 proportion
of the population with water from cleaner and safer groundwater
 sources. </p>

<p>Editorial Note: Epidemic typhoid fever emerged in Dushanbe because
 of
contamination of the city's water treatment and distribution
 systems
following the dissolution of the Soviet Union and an ensuing civil
 war.
Through support from the U.S. Agency for International Development
 (USAID),
the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
 Societies, and
other partners, measures to improve chlorination, repair
 infrastructure,
conserve water, and educate the public have contributed to
 controlling the
epidemic. </p>
<p>During January-March 1998, the incidence of typhoid fever in
 Dushanbe
decreased approximately 90% compared with January-March 1997;
 however,
continued epidemiologic and laboratory surveillance are needed to
 guide
resource allocation, monitor the effectiveness of prevention
 efforts, and
determine appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The judicious use of
fluoroquinolones is recommended to treat typhoid fever in Dushanbe.

However, patients infected with nalidixic acid-resistant S. Typhi
 who
receive short-course therapy with fluoroquinolones may not
 demonstrate
clinical recovery and require repeated or alternative retreatment
 (4). In
addition, the potential emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant
 strains
warrants close vigilance. </p>
<p>The control and prevention of typhoid fever and other
 waterborne
epidemic diseases in Dushanbe depends on repairing the water
 treatment and
distribution systems and achieving adequate chlorination of
 drinking water.
Major infrastructure repairs may require years of investment and
 should be
complemented by water conservation efforts and the eventual
 introduction of
a fee-for-use schedule. Reducing water wastage will improve water
 pressure
in the distribution system and decrease the volume of water that
 needs to
be provided and the amount of resources required to treat water. </p>
<p>Until the municipal water supply reliably provides safe
 drinking
water, public education campaigns stressing the importance of
 boiling all
drinking water, conserving municipal water, and promoting basic
 hygiene
measures to prevent the spread of typhoid fever will need to be
strengthened. Other central Asian cities have similar economic and
infrastructure problems and may be at risk for similar waterborne
epidemics. To reduce the risk for similar epidemics in the region,
 CDC is
working with USAID and the governments of the other central Asian
 republics
to evaluate water treatment and distribution systems and enhance
surveillance for diseases caused by waterborne pathogens. </p>
