In addition, it is a person who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution, or a well-founded fear of persecution, on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Refugees are required to apply for Legal Permanent Resident status 1 year after entry into and physical presence in the United States.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/ilink/docView/SLB/HTML/SLB/act.html">Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)</a> was enacted in 1952. Before the INA, a variety of statutes governed immigration law but were not organized in one location. The McCarran-Walter Bill of 1952, Public Law No. 82-414, collected and codified many existing provisions and reorganized the structure of immigration law. The Act has been amended many times over the years but is still the basic body of immigration law.</p>

<p>Although it stands alone as a body of law, the Act is also contained in the United States Code. The code is a collection of all the laws of the United States, arranged in 50 subject titles by general alphabetic order. Title 8 of the U.S. Code, one of the 50 titles, deals with "Aliens and Nationality."</p>

Quarantine regulations apply to all persons entering the United States, whether legally or illegally. Refugees are also subject to quarantine laws of the Public Health Service Act upon arrival in the United States. <a href="../../quarantine/aboutlawsregulationsquarantineisolation.html"> By Executive Order of the President, as amended April 11, 2005 and updated July 31, 2014, federal isolation and quarantine are authorized for the following communicable diseases:</a> cholera; diphtheria; infectious tuberculosis; plague; smallpox; yellow fever; and viral hemorrhagic fevers (Lassa, Marburg, Ebola, Crimean-Congo, South American, and others not yet isolated or named); severe acute respiratory syndromes; and influenza caused by novel or re-emerging influenza viruses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/orr/resource/the-refugee-act">Refugee Act of 1980</a> (Section 412 of the Immigration and Nationality Act) created The Federal Refugee Resettlement Program to provide for the resettlement of refugees and to assist refugees in achieving economic self-sufficiency as soon as possible after arrival in the United States.</p>

<p>The CDCâs DGMQ has been delegated certain responsibilities under this act. These responsibilities include:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>providing for the identification of refugees who have been determined to have medical conditions affecting the public health and requiring treatment;</li>

<li>assuring that State and/or local health officials at the resettlement destination of each refugee are promptly notified of the refugeeâs arrival and provided with all applicable medical records;</li>

<li>providing for such monitoring of refugees identified with medical conditions affecting public health and requiring treatment, ensuring that they receive appropriate and timely treatment; and developing and implementing methods for monitoring and assessing the quality of medical screening and related health services provided to refugees awaiting resettlement to the United States.</li>

<p>The âMedical Examination of Aliensâ (42 CFR, Part 34) regulation lists certain health-related conditions that, if identified during the medical examination, are grounds for inadmissibility (Class A condition) or represent such significant health problems (Class B condition) that must be brought to the attention of consular authorities.</p>

<p>Class A conditions include diseases that may pose a threat to public health or may require an individual to be quarantined. Class A conditions include:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>active tuberculosis;</li>

<li>untreated syphilis;</li>

<li>untreated gonorrhea;</li>

<li>Hansenâs disease, which is also known as leprosy;</li>

<li>pandemic flu;</li>

<li>severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS);</li>

<li>viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Marburg and Ebola;</li>

<li>cholera;</li>

<li>diphtheria;</li>

<li>plague;</li>

<li>smallpox; and</li>

<li>yellow fever.</li>
</ul>

<p>The list of diseases that are considered Class A conditions can change. New diseases may be added to the list in the event of a public health emergency, and the President of the United States can issue an Executive Order to make updates to the list of Class A conditions. The World Health Organization may also identify a global public health emergency that requires CDC to update or change the list of Class A conditions.</p>

<p>Other Class A conditions are:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>Physical or mental disorders with current associated harmful behavior or history of associated harmful behavior that is likely to recur; and</li>

<li>Substance-related disorders</li>
</ul>

<p>Class B conditions are health-related conditions that may require extensive medical treatment or follow-up. Class B conditions include:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>inactive or noninfectious tuberculosis;</li>

<li>treated syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases;</li>

<li>Hansenâs disease (leprosy), which has been treated or meets certain criteria;</li>

<li>certain substance-related disorders that are in remission; and</li>

<li>certain physical or mental disorders that donât have associated harmful behaviors or behaviors that are likely to recur.</li>
</ul>

<p>Class B conditions will not prevent a person from being admitted into the United States. However, Class B conditions are significant enough to interfere with a personâs ability to care for themselves or their ability to attend work or school. Class B conditions often require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization.</p>

<p>On September 30, 1996, the U.S. Congress amended the Immigration and Nationality Act by adding to the health-related grounds of inadmissibility a new subsection, âProof of Vaccination Requirements for Immigrants.â This new subsection requires any person who seeks an immigrant visa to show proof of having received vaccination against vaccine-preventable diseases, as recommended by the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.</p>

<p>The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service â now Department of Homeland Security, United States Citizenship and Immigrant Service â determined that the vaccination requirements do not apply to refugees and nonimmigrants at the time of their initial admission to the United States. However, refugees and V (spouses or children of permanent residents) and K (fiancÃ©(e) of permanent resident) visa holders in the United States must comply with the vaccination requirements when they apply for adjustment of status to Legal Permanent Resident; for refugees, this application occurs 1 year after arrival in the United States.</p>

			<h3>Medical Screening: Domestic Guidelines and Recommendations</h3>			
			<div id="accordion_1177337" class="accordion">			
														<h4>Is there domestic guidance for states performing refugee health assessments for newly arrived refugees?</h4>
					<div>
						            			
		<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Currently, the guidance for states for the domestic follow-up examination for newly arrived refugees is the 1995 ORR Medical Screening Protocol (State Letter 95-37). Many states have added requirements in addition to the ORR protocol. The Department of Health and Human Services is now drafting guidance for an expanded domestic protocol for states.</p>

<p>Current domestic medical screening guidelines for newly arrived refugees are available on CDCâs Immigrant and Refugee Health <a href="domestic/domestic-guidelines.html">website</a>.</p>

	</div>
	  				
					</div>
														<h4>Is there guidance for healthcare providers performing refugee health assessments that provides targeted health and cultural information for specific refugee populations resettling to the United States? </h4>
					<div>
						            			
		<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>The Immigrant, Refugee, and Migrant Health Branch (IRMHB) of DGMQ has developed refugee health profiles, which provide key health and cultural information for specific refugee groups resettling to the United States. The profiles are provided to resettlement agencies, clinicians, and public health providers facilitating medical screening and interventions appropriate for each refugee group. Each profile has six components: priority health conditions, background, population movements, healthcare and nutrition in camps/urban settings, medical screening of U.S.-bound refugees, and general health information. Information was gathered from the World Health Organization (WHO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), U.S. Department of State, and other sources.</p>

<p>Available refugee health profiles can be found <a href="../profiles/index.html">here</a>. Additional profiles are under development. As refugee resettlement continues in the United States, and refugee populations become increasingly diverse, CDC will work to update existing profiles, as well as develop new profiles, as new information becomes available.</p>

	</div>
	  				
					</div>
														<h4>Is the post-arrival medical screening mandatory for immigrants and refugees who have B1 or B2 tuberculosis classifications?</h4>
					<div>
						            			
		<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>The post-arrival medical screening for immigrants and refugees with TB conditions is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended that the assessment be done. Any follow-up examination should be completed within 30 days post-arrival.</p>
	</div>
	  				
					</div>
														<h4>What are the post-arrival recommendations for health assessments of HIV-positive refugees?</h4>
					<div>
						            			
		<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>Current CDC guidelines for the United States recommend HIV screening in healthcare settings for all persons, including refugees, 13-64 years of age. Screening of refugees â¤12 years and â¥64 years of age is also recommended upon arrival. Repeat screening 3-6 months following resettlement is recommended for refugees with a recent exposure or high-risk activity to identify individuals who may be in the âwindow periodâ when they arrive in the United States.</p>

<p>Screening should be performed on all refugees unless they decline (opt out). When a refugee declines an HIV test, this decision should be documented in the medical record. Refugees should be clearly informed orally or in writing that HIV testing will be performed. Oral or written information should include an explanation of HIV infection and the meanings of positive and negative test results, and the patient should be offered an opportunity to ask questions. Appropriate referral for care, treatment, and preventive services should be made for all individuals confirmed to be HIV infected.</p>

		<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>All immigrant visa and refugee applicants must undergo a physical examination and mental status assessment as part of their application process. Panel physicians in foreign countries conduct these examinations. DS forms are Department of State forms used to the medical screening results from these medical examinations.</p>

<p>DS forms include the U.S. Department of State Medical Examination for Immigrant or Refugee Applicant (DS-2054) and the associated worksheets:</p>

<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>DS-3030 (Tuberculosis Worksheet)</li>

<li>DS-3025 (Vaccination Documentation Worksheet)</li>

<li>DS-3026 (Medical History and Physical Examination Worksheet)</li>

														<h4>What is EDN?</h4>
					<div>
						            			
		<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>The Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system is a web-based system that notifies state or local health officials when immigrants with notifiable conditions and refugees arrive in their jurisdictions. EDN provides medical information recorded on the DS form during the application process to these health officials for stateside follow-up. EDN was launched on March 20, 2006, and has been deployed to all states.</p>
