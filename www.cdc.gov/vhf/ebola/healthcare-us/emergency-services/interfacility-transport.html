<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="background" name="background" title="Background"><!-- --></a>Background</h2>

<p>The Ebola outbreak in West Africa increased the possibility of patients with Ebola traveling from countries with widespread transmission or uncertain control measures to the United States.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#one"><sup>1</sup></a> The likelihood of contracting Ebola is extremely low unless a person has had direct, unprotected contact with blood or body fluids (including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen) of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#two"><sup>2</sup></a> Symptoms of Ebola include fever, severe headache, muscle pain, weakness, fatigue, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and unexplained hemorrhage (bleeding or bruising).<a href="interfacility-transport.html#three"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>PUIs or patients with confirmed Ebola<a href="interfacility-transport.html#four"><sup>4</sup></a> may need to be transported to a designated Ebola treatment center (ETC)<a href="interfacility-transport.html#a"><sup>a</sup></a> for further management and care, particularly if they initially present at a frontline healthcare facility or Ebola assessment hospital.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#five"><sup>5</sup></a> Coordination is needed to facilitate patient transfers to a designated ETC.</p>

<p>To address the needs of America’s EMS providers, CDC and partners from the Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) developed <a href="ems-systems.html"><em>Interim Guidance for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Systems and 9-1-1 Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) for Management of Patients with Known or Suspected Ebola Virus Disease in the United States</em></a>. An accompanying <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/ems-911-patients-with-possible-ebola.pdf">algorithm</a> for EMS and 9-1-1 centers/Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) was also developed that illustrates the process of patient management and care from 9-1-1/PSAPs to the scene, then to the hospital and afterwards, including addressing key topics such as disinfection and waste disposal. Partner conference calls with EMS stakeholders highlighted a need for interfacility transport guidance. As planning for regional ETCs, state- or jurisdiction-designated ETCs<a href="interfacility-transport.html#b"><sup>b</sup></a>, and Ebola assessment hospitals is ongoing, much of the success of this strategy will depend on the ability to safely and efficiently transport patients to the appropriate facility.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#six"><sup>6</sup></a> This will require coordination and collaboration among many groups, including state and local public health, state and local EMS agencies, private and public providers (which includes fire-based delivery models), ground and air medical transport agencies, emergency management, healthcare, healthcare coalitions, and others.</p>

<p>The purpose of this document is to provide guidance for developing plans for personnel, including ground and air medical transport providers, as well as managers of EMS agencies, EMS medical directors, local and state EMS systems, local and state health departments, healthcare facilities, and others involved in the interfacility (including intrastate or interstate) transport of PUIs or patients with confirmed Ebola<a href="interfacility-transport.html#c"><sup>c</sup></a>. While each jurisdiction is different, regional and state EMS planners can use this planning guidance to assist with increasing coordination, developing regional transport networks, local transport plans, and standard operating procedures (SOPs), and engaging partners to prepare and conduct interfacility transports of PUIs or patients with confirmed Ebola. A variety of stakeholders from the jurisdiction, region, and/or state should be involved in the development of the plans. Jurisdictional needs and resources should be taken into consideration and planners should clarify the level of engagement expected from local EMS agencies.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#six"><sup>6</sup></a> The guidance is presented at a level of detail that will afford local planners and operators the flexibility to develop procedures that are suitable for their environment. This guidance document is to be used as a supplement to other published guidance.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#seven"><sup>7,</sup></a><a href="interfacility-transport.html#eight"><sup>8,</sup></a><a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirteen"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>In this document the term “EMS transport agency” refers to EMS agencies and ambulance services that are conducting the interfacility transport of a PUI or patient with confirmed Ebola.</p>

<p>Of note, the air transport aspects of this guidance are focused on fixed-wing transport and not rotor-wing. In addition, this guidance does not address the transportation of human remains that may contain Ebola virus. CDC developed separate <a href="../hospitals/handling-human-remains.html">guidance</a> about postmortem preparation, transportation of human remains, mortuary care, and disposition of remains.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-nine"><sup>39</sup></a></p>

<p>Three separate standard operating procedures (SOPs) are appendices to this guidance. They include:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="patient-handoff.html">Example: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Patient Handoff between a Healthcare Facility and a Transporting Ambulance</a></li>

<li><a href="ambulance-decontamination.html">Example: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Decontamination of an Ambulance that has Transported a Person under Investigation or Patient with Confirmed Ebola</a></li>

<li><a href="air-ground-patient-handoff.html">Example: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Air-to-Ground (Air-Ground) Patient Handoff</a></li>
</ol>

<p>These SOPs can be used as templates or guides for the development of local/state/jurisdiction level SOPs. <a href="http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/responders/ebola/Pages/air-transport-factsheet.aspx">Other resources</a> may also be used for the development of SOPs.</p>

<h2><a class="onThisPageAnchor" id="coordination" name="coordination" title="1. Coordination, Planning, and Partners"><!-- --></a>1. Coordination, Planning, and Partners — Before, During, and After the Transport</h2>


				    <div class="module-typeB" >
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
		<div>
		<ul class="list-bullet"> 
 <li>Coordination among public health, healthcare, EMS, healthcare coalitions, law enforcement, and emergency management should occur during all phases of preparation and planning, and throughout the interfacility transport, as appropriate.</li> 
 <li>Multidisciplinary coordination is an essential element of safe and effective interfacility transport and is strongly emphasized in this planning guidance.</li> 
 <li>Existing relationships between healthcare facilities and EMS providers should be respected and encouraged. A strong EMS/hospital interface, with training, exercises, and development of SOPs that involve both healthcare and EMS providers, will contribute to confusion-free operations and development of best practices. A strong EMS/hospital interface will also provide optimal care for the patient, while providing for the safety of the healthcare providers, both in and out of the hospital.</li> 
 <li>Planners may consider adopting a phased approach due to the complexity of coordination for this event. A deliberate, measured approach may be helpful when developing these plans and procedures, while allowing stakeholders to think critically about each phase of the process, including before, during, and after the transport.</li> 
 <li>Some jurisdictions may choose to stand up an Emergency Operations Center (EOC) or Incident Command System (ICS) using Unified Command during the transport process.</li> 
</ul>				</div>

<h3><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></h3>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Pre-transport planning</span></h4>

<h5><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Coordination with public health, state/local EMS, emergency management, and healthcare coalition</span></h5>

<h6><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Relationship-building</span></h6>

<ul>
<li>Identify and coordinate with state/local governments, state/local public health, state/local EMS, emergency management, healthcare coalitions, law enforcement, unions, and others as appropriate to the jurisdiction who should be involved in planning for interfacility transport of a PUI or patient with confirmed Ebola.</li>

<li>Identify and define the role of the state/local public health official(s) and ensure they are integrated into the planning and coordination of these transports, with particular emphasis on EMS system coordination.</li>

<li>Coordinate with state and local public health agencies and other government entities (local, county, state) on training, planning, and transport activities.</li>

<li>Coordinate with state/local law enforcement on planning and transport issues, such as airport security, facilitating transport, security at receiving facility, etc.</li>

<li>Coordinate with state/local authorities on planning and transport, specifically pre-approval of roadway routes and ensuring proper authorities are available to respond to any issues related to the route during transport. Determine who will establish primary transport routes and alternatives, including security and maintenance of the routes (e.g., plowing or salting during a snow event).</li>

<li>Identify and build relationships with authorities at the local airport.</li>

<li>Ensure involvement in healthcare coalition planning efforts by EMS, emergency management, law enforcement, and others with roles in interfacility transport of the PUI or confirmed patient.</li>

<li>For interstate transport, pre-identify and coordinate with the primary liaison(s) or contact(s) in other state(s) involved with transport.</li>
</ul>

<h6><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Notification and decision-making</span></h6>

<ul>
<li>Verify whether your jurisdiction has a state/local infectious disease transport plan and what agencies are responsible for implementing the plan. Ensure all efforts in the jurisdiction are aligned to this transport plan, if available.</li>

<li>Determine which agencies have the responsibility and authority for the following:

<ul>
<li>Developing a coordinated Unified Command through each stage of the event. Determine if any modifications to the ICS structure will be needed for the response.</li>

<li>Providing notification to public health, healthcare agencies, hospitals, EMS, emergency management, and law enforcement that a PUI or patient with confirmed Ebola is in their jurisdiction, determining how this notification will occur, and coordinating the transfer with the facilities.</li>

<li>Deciding which facility will receive the patient and whether this is the assessment hospital (for PUIs) or regional, state, or jurisdiction-designated ETC. This discussion should include the possible length of time for the transport and staffing needs.</li>

<li>Identifying an alternative receiving facility in the event that the designated ETC is unavailable to accept patients.</li>

<li>Deciding which EMS transport agency will conduct the transport. Check with the receiving facility and with local EMS agencies to see if there is already a dedicated ambulance and/or transport team identified. All EMS agency staff should be trained to screen for symptoms of Ebola, including during transport. Due to the extensive training necessary and the equipment and supplies that may be needed both for transport and training, one EMS agency may be selected or volunteer to take the responsibility of being the designated transport team.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>For interstate transports, determine which state will be the lead for the transport. This may impact financial responsibility and chain of command.</li>

<li>Verify your jurisdiction’s plan and the designated ETCs for caring for patients with Ebola.</li>

<li>Determine who has financial responsibility for the transport services.</li>

<li>Ensure that protocols are in place for notifying and activating the EMS transport agency. Engage state/local public health and designated healthcare facilities in these discussions.</li>

<li>Determine the medical authority for the patient while in transit. This will generally be the transporting EMS agency medical director or designee.</li>

<li>Determine contacts among law enforcement required for escort.</li>

<li>Determine the process for establishing routes and alternate routes if needed.</li>

<li>If a transport team from the ETC will be used, determine how long it will take for the team to arrive and how they will be activated.</li>

<li>Determine which staff will conduct the transfer (e.g., a specially trained group of prehospital providers, trained hospital staff, etc.). Consider how many and what level of staff will be involved, their necessary training, and the vehicle configuration and capabilities.</li>

<li>Engage the person(s) responsible for worker safety and infection control of EMS transport crew.</li>

<li>Determine who will conduct monitoring<a href="interfacility-transport.html#twenty-two"><sup>22</sup></a> of the EMS transport agency personnel that have direct contact with the patient.</li>

<li>Discuss appropriate level of personal protective equipment (PPE) based on risk of exposure and patient symptoms.</li>

<li>Discuss PPE supply and availability for the transport teams through local partners, including healthcare coalitions and other non-EMS external partners.</li>

<li>Ensure that policies and protocols exist for transporting pediatric patients.</li>

<li>Consider coordinating with social services to assist with additional support for the patient’s family and significant others.</li>

<li>Ensure there are capabilities for patients with functional or access needs (e.g., hearing, vision, limited mobility), device dependence, and limited English proficiency, and for pediatric or elderly patients.</li>

</ul>

<h5><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Coordination with sending and receiving facilities</span></h5>

<ul>
<li>Ensure appropriate packaging, transport, and disposal of PPE and waste materials generated while caring for the patient to facilities authorized to process and dispose of the waste. Waste generated while performing emergency medical services on a PUI or patient with confirmed Ebola is excepted from the HMR under §177.823(a)(3), but once an ambulance or emergency motor vehicle is at a location where decontamination of the vehicle is performed, any suspected Ebola waste offloaded from the vehicle must be packaged and transported in accordance with the HMR or transported under a special permit granted by PHMSA. Several waste transportation companies hold party status to Department of Transportation (DOT) Special Permit 16279, which allows for transportation of Ebola-contaminated waste. For a current listing of permit holders, please refer to <a href="http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/hazmat/regs/sp-a/special-permits/search">PHMSA’s special permit database</a>.</li>

<li>Ensure completion of proper decontamination of the ambulance and equipment.</li>

				    <div class="module-typeB" >
		<h3>Key Points</h3>
		<div>
		<ul class="list-bullet"> 
 <li>Medical oversight is the medical authority and responsibility for all medical care provided by the EMS service, including active day-to-day role in the function and management of the service as it relates to patient care activities.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#ten"><sup>10</sup></a> Medical oversight ensures that care is provided by competent medical professionals, consistent with accepted standards.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#nine"><sup>9</sup></a></li> 
 <li>Medical oversight of patient care during the interfacility transfer is essential to ensure quality patient care throughout the transport of the PUI or patient with confirmed Ebola. Medical oversight includes online medical direction, such as direct observation of treatment and communication with the transport crew, or offline medical direction, such as protocols and standing orders, or a combination thereof. The authority and responsibility of medical directors varies by state.</li> 
 <li>Medical oversight should be consistent with all states’ legal authorities, pre-planned with each facility, institutionalized by pre-established Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) among the sending/receiving facilities and the transporting agencies, and well-known among all partners including healthcare coalitions.</li> 
 <li>The primary role of the medical director is to ensure quality patient care, with responsibilities including the ongoing design, operation, evaluation, and revision of the EMS system from initial patient access to final patient care destination, the development of medical policies and procedures, and ensuring that patient care activities performed by EMS providers are appropriate and within their scope of practice.<sup><a href="interfacility-transport.html#nine">9</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#ten">10</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#eleven">11</a></sup></li> 
 <li>Generally, medical oversight during transport will reside with the medical director of the EMS transport agency, but this may vary depending on the jurisdiction. In some instances, the transport agency may not have a medical director and authority may come from a jurisdictional (e.g., county) EMS medical director.</li> 
 <li>The medical director or appropriate person providing medical oversight should be actively involved in planning/preparation and available for consultation during interfacility transport of PUIs or patients with confirmed Ebola.</li> 
 <li>EMS transport agency providers will generally use clinical care guidelines/protocols developed and/or approved by the agency medical director or as otherwise directed by their local jurisdiction. This helps to ensure the appropriate training and competencies of the providers. Patients with Ebola often require specialized clinical protocols and management strategies that balance clinical requirements and patient needs with the safety of responders and the public.</li> 
</ul>				</div>
	</div>
	  

<h3><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></h3>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Role of medical director (or appropriate person providing medical oversight)</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Participate in pre-planning with state EMS directors and state/local system medical directors for states in which transports may cross state lines. This will help to ensure consistency of protocols, clearly define who has what authority to practice and under what conditions, and clarify other issues that may be involved with the interstate transport of the patient and actions needed to address these issues.</li>

<li>Collaborate with the sending facilities, receiving facilities, and transporting agencies to ensure that pre-established MOUs/agreements are in place and include the delineation of responsibilities and authorities for medical oversight of the transport and pre-determined modes of secure communication.</li>

<li>Consider the level of care of the ambulance and its crew and the minimum number of staff needed during the transport in order to reduce possible risk of exposure.</li>

<li>In conjunction with the state office of EMS, determine who has legal authority for medical oversight of providers practicing in geographical areas outside of their normal operating area and who assumes the liability for care they provide.</li>

<li>Consider the role of medical oversight following transport, including continuous quality improvement and evaluation of metrics (e.g., transport times, equipment failure, educational opportunities, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Protocol development</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Develop protocols for the management of the patient during transport. This should include any invasive procedures (e.g., suctioning, resuscitation) that should or should not be performed during transport in order to reduce the potential risk of exposure (see <a href="interfacility-transport.html#care">Section 8: Clinical Care during Transport</a>). Consider including a medical ethicist, infectious disease physicians with expertise in this area, and labor unions in these conversations. Determine if scope of practice of the transport providers is affected with interstate transports.</li>

<h3><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></h3>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Overview of basic infection control strategies</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Designate an infection control officer/specialist and determine his or her role during the transport based on CDC guidelines and supported by the EMS agency medical director. Determine if multiple infection control officers/specialists will be involved (e.g., from sending facility, from receiving facility, from EMS transport agency) and which infection control officer has responsibility/authority as the patient is moved from sending facility to receiving facility.</li>

<li>Identify a protocol for how to respond in the event of a PPE breach.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#twenty-three"><sup>23</sup></a></li>

<li>Ensure that a plan is in place for storage and disposal of waste and disinfection of PPE and contaminated equipment/facilities.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of PPE for EMS transport agency providers and protocols for obtaining additional PPE supplies.</li>

<li>Be cognizant of expiration dates of certain PPE, including respirators.</li>

<li>Collaborate with state EMS office and public health, emergency management, sending and receiving facilities, and other healthcare organizations or systems to address any potential supply chain issues.</li>

<li>Coordinate with partners (e.g., state and local public health, healthcare coalitions, private partners).</li>

<li>Determine the role of state/federal public health authorities in assisting the healthcare sector in prioritizing orders with manufacturers/suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Appropriate PPE</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Determine the appropriate level of PPE for each member of the transport team based on patient condition and symptoms, length of transport, operating environment, provider competencies, availability of supplies, and guidelines provided by CDC and supported by the EMS agency medical director. Involve stakeholders in these discussions, including EMS, public health, and clinical care providers. The determination should also consider a worker’s ability to wear certain types of PPE (e.g., medical clearance, and fit testing).</li>

<li>Select PPE that is appropriate for use in healthcare infection control scenarios. If EMS personnel plan to use PPE and procedures based on HAZMAT training, encourage them to review the appropriateness of these processes with the state or local health department and to consider that OSHA recommends avoiding cleaning techniques, such as using pressurized air or water sprays, that may result in the generation of bioaerosols.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#twenty-four"><sup>24</sup></a></li>

<li>Determine work/rest cycles for personnel wearing PPE.</li>

<h3><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span>:</h3>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Ambulance preparation</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Consider the following when developing plans for ambulance preparation: patient symptoms, length of time required for the patient transport, whether the driver compartment is isolated from the patient, and whether a designated transport vehicle will be used.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#twenty-nine"><sup>29,</sup></a><a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty"><sup>30</sup></a></li>

<li>Determine the resources needed to prepare the ambulance for transfer of a PUI or a patient with confirmed Ebola.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-one"><sup>31</sup></a></li>

<li>Determine if a designated vehicle will be used for these transports.</li>

<li>Determine what type of vehicle and capabilities will be used for these transports (e.g., Type I).</li>

<li>Consider the use of a step-by-step checklist during ambulance preparation.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Minimum equipment</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Some agencies may have a designated transport vehicle for transporting patients with Ebola. Carry all equipment in compliance with state minimum requirements for an ambulance, but in a manner that protects from contamination. Meet equipment requirements necessary for the patient transfer (and approved by the medical director) and provider protection that are consistent with state/local licensing regulations.</li>

<li>Consult state recommendations on minimum ambulance equipment.<a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-two"><sup>32</sup></a> Consider whether the minimum equipment list is consistent with the recommended equipment for ground ambulances, or if additional equipment and supplies should be included.</li>

<li>Coordinate the list of minimum equipment with the state EMS office and local medical director to address consistency with state law/rules or obtain a waiver from them, if required. These may vary by state. Depending on the jurisdiction, the state EMS regulatory agency may need to approve a waiver if certain equipment deemed not necessary for the transport is removed from the ambulance.</li>
</ul>

<h4><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Transport resources and staff</span></h4>

<ul>
<li>Determine recommended specialized items that may be necessary during transport, as well as their availability. Items may include:

<ul>
<li>Diapers (adult and pediatric)</li>

<li>Medications (e.g., antidiarrheal/antiemetic)</li>

<li>Barrier sheets or body bags</li>

<li>Patient PPE</li>

<li>Large capacity emesis containers</li>

<li>Disposable stethoscopes and blood pressure cuffs</li>

<li>EPA-registered disinfectant wipes (for spills during transport)</li>

<li>Fluid administration guidelines</li>

<li>Sedation and/or pain control guidelines</li>

<li>Additional gear, as needed, based on condition of the patient</li>

<li>SOPs to prevent contamination of environmental surfaces</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Address ambulance licensing and patient care personnel licensing requirements within, and between, the states in which the transports will be occurring. Determine if there are reciprocity requirements (if needed) for EMS transport (ambulance) licensing and patient care personnel licensing and if there are provisions for an occasional transport with the states in which the ambulance and personnel may not be licensed.</li>

<li>If transport resources are limited, develop a contingency plan for appropriate isolation and/or quarantine. Include who will provide medications, equipment, supplies, and provisions for the quarantined patient and their wastes.</li>

<li>For interstate transports, determine if there are requirements for licensed staffing in ambulances or if a waiver is needed to deviate from the standard. Determine if all transport staff crossing state lines meet these requirements, or if other legal workarounds have been provided in advance.</li>

		<h3>Key Points</h3>
		<div>
		<ul class="list-bullet"> 
 <li>The presence of a guardian/parent might be needed in caring for these children so that the child can continue to be nurtured and supported while ill. Such caregivers should only travel with a child if the child is not exhibiting obvious bleeding, vomiting, or diarrhea. In the event that a parent or legal guardian cannot be present for transport, they may designate an alternative adult caregiver. The caregiver must use a face shield and surgical face mask, an impermeable gown, and two pairs of gloves.<sup><a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-three">33</a></sup></li> 
</ul>				</div>
	</div>
	  

<h3><span style=" text-decoration: underline;">Considerations</span></h3>

<ul>
<li>Determine appropriateness of parental/guardian presence for children.</li>

<li>Ensure that capabilities and protocols exist for transporting pediatric patients, with details for how to handle those with special healthcare needs, those who are device dependent, or those with access and functional needs.<sup><a href="interfacility-transport.html#fourteen">14</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#sixteen">16</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-three">33</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#forty-one">41</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#forty-two">42</a>,<a href="interfacility-transport.html#forty-three">43</a></sup> Coordinate with relevant state/local social services agencies.</li>

<li>Ensure that equipment to meet both basic and advanced life support needs of children is available.</li>

<li>Consider staffing requirements and if these will change for the transport of a pediatric patient.</li>

<li>Review the most current guidance regarding PPE use for the pediatric patient and caregiver.<sup><a href="interfacility-transport.html#thirty-three">33</a></sup></li>

<li>Discuss the use of isopods<a href="interfacility-transport.html#d"><sup>d</sup></a> with medical authorities to determine if these will be used when transporting pediatric patients.</li>

<li>Provide the patient’s family with information about what to expect during and after the transport.</li>

<li>Infants and young children can have difficulty in managing body fluids. A diapered child shedding Ebola virus in the stool poses a risk to others in a care setting. There should be adequate availability of diapers of different sizes.</li>

  <!-- --></a><a id="a" name="a"> </a><sup>a</sup><span class="smallFontSize">Acute healthcare facilities can serve one of three roles: as a frontline healthcare facility, Ebola assessment hospital, or Ebola treatment center. Frontline healthcare facilities should be prepared to promptly identify and isolate patients who may have Ebola and promptly inform the hospital/facility infection control program and state and local public health agency. Frontline healthcare facilities, in accordance with the state’s plan, should consider immediately transferring patients who have a higher probability of Ebola or are more severely ill to either an Ebola assessment hospital or to an Ebola treatment center that can provide Ebola testing and care for the higher risk patients until an Ebola diagnosis is either confirmed or ruled out. Ebola assessment hospitals are facilities prepared to receive and isolate PUIs and care for the patient until a diagnosis of Ebola can be confirmed or ruled out and until discharge or transfer is completed. Because it may take 72 hours or longer after symptom onset to definitively confirm or rule out an Ebola diagnosis (with an additional 12 to 24 hours for specimen transport, testing, and identification of another facility for transfer if needed), Ebola assessment hospitals should be prepared to provide care for PUIs for up to 96 hours. Ebola treatment centers are facilities that plan to care for and manage a patient with confirmed Ebola for the duration of the patient’s illness. State and local decisions to designate Ebola treatment centers are informed by the results of a CDC site visit conducted by an interdisciplinary team of subject matter experts. Additional information about the tiered approach is available at <a href="../preparing/hospitals.html">http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/healthcare-us/preparing/hospitals.html.</a></span></p> 
<p><a id="b" name="b"> </a><sup>b</sup><span class="smallFontSize">HHS’ Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) awarded approximately $20 million through its Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP) to enhance the regional treatment centers’ capabilities to care for patients with Ebola or other highly infectious diseases. Regional ETCs are part of a national network of ETCs, but have enhanced capabilities to treat a patient with confirmed Ebola or other highly infectious disease.</span></p> 
<p><a id="c" name="c"> </a><sup>c</sup><span class="smallFontSize">This guidance does not address the transportation of human remains that may contain Ebola virus.
