However, CDC no longer recommends active monitoring for travelers arriving in the United States from Guinea.

<ul type="circle">
<li>Travelers coming from Guinea will still undergo exit screening before leaving the country.</li>

<li>Upon entry to the United States, travelers will answer questions about travel history and possible exposures to Ebola. They will also provide contact information so that the health department at their destination can connect with them, if needed.</li>

<li>Travelers from Guinea will receive a modified CARE (Check and Report Ebola) Kit including information about Ebola, a thermometer, and contact information for state and local health departments. CDC recommends these travelers watch their health for 21 days after leaving Guinea, and to contact their state or local health department or seek health care if they develop fever or any other symptoms that might be consistent with Ebola.</li>

<li>According to the <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-25-november-2015">WHO’s November 25 Situation Report</a>, Liberia reported a cluster of three confirmed cases of Ebola in the week up to November 22, 2015.

<li>On November 7, 2015, <a href="http://www.afro.who.int/en/sierra-leone/press-materials/item/8139-who-commends-sierra-leone-for-stopping-ebola-virus-transmission.html" target="_blank" title="Link to External Web Site">WHO declared the end of Ebola virus transmission in Sierra Leone</a> after 42 days had passed since the second negative test of the last confirmed patient with Ebola in the country. The country has now entered a 90-day period of enhanced surveillance.</li>

<li>As of November 10, 2015, enhanced entry screening and monitoring have changed for travelers entering the United States from Sierra Leone. These travelers will continue to enter through one of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/travelers/ebola-screening-factsheet.html">five U.S. airports conducting enhanced entry screening</a>. However, because the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone is now over, CDC no longer recommends active monitoring for those travelers arriving in the United States from Sierra Leone.

<ul type="circle">
<li>Travelers will still undergo exit screening before leaving Sierra Leone.</li>

<li>Upon entry to the United States, travelers will still have their temperatures taken and answer questions about travel history and possible exposures to Ebola. Travelers will also provide their contact information so that the health department at their destination can connect with them, if needed.</li>

<li>Travelers from Sierra Leone will now receive a modified CARE Kit including information about Ebola, a thermometer, and contact information for state and local health departments. Travelers from Sierra Leone will be encouraged to watch their health for 21 days after leaving Sierra Leone, and to contact their state or local health department or seek health care if they develop fever or any other symptoms that might be consistent with Ebola.</li>

<li>Entry screening and monitoring will not change for travelers entering the United States from Guinea – this includes travelers from Sierra Leone who have also been in Guinea within the past 21 days.</li>

The other case was reported in Bombali, which has not reported a case for over 5 months. A rapid response team has been deployed to coordinate case investigation and contact tracing.

<h5>Outbreak Update</h5>

<ul>
<li>According to <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-29-july-2015">WHO’s July 29 Situation Report</a>, there were seven confirmed cases of Ebola reported in the week up to July 26. This is the lowest weekly total in over a year and comes after eight consecutive weeks during which case incidence had stayed at between 20 and 30 cases per week. Despite this decline, there have been several high-risk events in Guinea and Sierra Leone recently, and there are still more than 2,000 contacts still within their 21-day monitoring period in all three countries. No new cases have been reported in Liberia, and the remaining four patients have been discharged after treatment.</li>

<li>On June 29, 2015, a confirmed case of Ebola was reported in a 17-year-old male in Liberia. Five contacts associated with this case have been confirmed to have Ebola, one of whom died. Genetic sequencing show this virus appears to be related to the one previously circulating in Liberia, suggesting the virus was not imported from Sierra Leone or Guinea. A CDC field team continues to work with the Liberian Ministry of Health and other partners to determine the source, understand the chain of transmission, and prevent further spread. As of July 21, 56 contacts associated with the chain of transmission are being monitored.</li>

<li>As of June 17, 2015, entry screening changed for travelers coming to the United States from Liberia. These travelers will continue to enter through one of five U.S. airports (New York’s JFK, Washington-Dulles, Newark International, Chicago O’Hare, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson). However, because the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now over, CDC no longer recommends active monitoring for those travelers arriving in the United States from Liberia.

<h5>Outbreak Update</h5>

<ul>
<li>According to <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-22-july-2015">WHO’s July 22 Situation Report</a>, there were 26 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in the week up to July 19. Of those cases, 22 were in Guinea and four were in Sierra Leone. All but two of these cases arose from registered contacts of previous cases. This is the highest proportion of cases to arise among contacts since the beginning of the outbreak. No new cases were reported from Liberia.</li>

<li>On June 29, 2015, a confirmed case of Ebola was reported in a 17-year-old male in Liberia. Five contacts associated with this case have been confirmed to have Ebola, one of whom died. Genetic sequencing show this virus appears to be related to the one previously circulating in Liberia, suggesting the virus was not imported from Sierra Leone or Guinea. A CDC field team continues to work with the Liberian Ministry of Health and other partners to determine the source, understand the chain of transmission, and prevent further spread. As of July 21, 56 contacts associated with the chain of transmission are being monitored.</li>

<li>On July 20, Italy was declared free of Ebola transmission after 42 days had passed since the country’s first and only case of Ebola to date was confirmed Ebola-negative.</li>

<li>As of June 17, 2015, entry screening changed for travelers coming to the United States from Liberia. These travelers will continue to enter through one of five U.S. airports (New York’s JFK, Washington-Dulles, Newark International, Chicago O’Hare, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson).

<h5>Outbreak Update</h5>

<ul>
<li>As of July 20, two incubation periods (42 days) have passed since the patient diagnosed with Ebola in Italy last tested negative for the disease on June 9. Italy is now considered free of Ebola virus transmission in accordance with WHO guidelines.</li>

<li>According to WHO’s <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-15-july-2015/">July 15 Situation Report</a>, there were 30 confirmed cases of Ebola reported in the week up to July 12. Only one of these cases came from an unknown source of infection; however, a substantial proportion continue to be identified only after postmortem testing.</li>

<li>On June 29, 2015, a new confirmed case of Ebola was reported in a 17-year-old male in Liberia. As of July 15, five contacts associated with this case have been confirmed to have Ebola.

These travelers will continue to enter through one of five U.S. airports (New York&#8217;s JFK, Washington-Dulles, Newark International, Chicago O&#8217;Hare, and Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson). However, because the Ebola outbreak in Liberia is now over, CDC no longer recommends active monitoring for those travelers arriving in the United States from Liberia.</p><ul><li>Upon entry, travelers will still have their temperatures taken and be asked questions about travel history and possible exposures to Ebola. Travelers will also need to provide their contact information so that the health department at their destination can connect with them, if needed.</li><li>Travelers from Liberia will now receive a modified CARE Kit including information about Ebola, a thermometer, and contact information for state and local health departments. Travelers from Liberia will be encouraged to watch their health for 21 days after leaving Liberia, and to contact their state or local health department if they develop fever or any other symptoms that might be consistent with Ebola.</li><li>Travelers will still undergo exit screening before departing from Liberia. Entry screening and monitoring will not change for travelers entering the United States from Guinea or Sierra Leone &#8211; this includes travelers from Liberia who have also traveled to either Guinea or Sierra Leone within the past 21 days.</li></ul></li><li>According to WHO&#8217;s <a href="http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-17-june-2015">June 17 Situation Report</a>, 76 confirmed cases of Ebola were reported from Guinea and Sierra Leone in the 21 days leading up to June 14. Most of these cases came from well-characterized chains of transmission and arose among registered, monitored contacts of previous cases.</li><li>The last health worker infections in Guinea and Sierra Leone were reported on April 6 and May 14, respectively. There have been a total of 869 confirmed health worker infections reported from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone since the start of the outbreak, with 507 reported deaths.</li></ul>

This is the lowest weekly total this year. &#160;In the previous week, both countries reported nine cases. As of May 12, Sierra Leone had reported eight consecutive days without a confirmed case. Of the seven cases reported for Guinea, six came from one prefecture, &#160;which has been the focus of transmission for several weeks.&#160; Four of the six cases were from one sub-prefecture that borders Sierra Leone. The seventh confirmed case was identified post mortem in a separate prefecture. Investigations have not been able to establish a link with a previously reported case. The absence of an established epidemiological link between this case and a known chain of transmission is of concern. Preliminary reports from that prefecture since May 10 indicate that the case has resulted in at least three additional confirmed cases.</li><li>In total, four of the seven cases reported from Guinea in the week leading up to May 10 were identified post mortem. One of the seven cases was a registered contact of a previous case. For the third consecutive week there was a decline in the number of reported unsafe burials, with 23 unsafe burials out of 368 reported community deaths. Based on the information above, tracking transmission chains is still a challenge and there remains a possibility of an increase in case reports and/or geographical spread in the coming weeks.</li><li>In Sierra Leone, the two reported cases were from one area of Freetown. The two patients were known contacts of a previous case and were under quarantine when symptoms developed. Following treatment, one of the two patients has tested negative for Ebola two times.&#160;</li><li>On May 9, the Ebola virus outbreak in Liberia was declared over after 42 days had elapsed since the burial of the last confirmed case in the country. The country has now entered a three-month period of heightened vigilance. WHO will maintain an enhanced presence in the country until the end of 2015, with a particular focus on areas that border Guinea and Sierra Leone.</li><li>On May 12, WHO received notification of a laboratory-confirmed case in Italy. The patient is a volunteer health worker who returned from Sierra Leone on May 7. The patient developed symptoms on May 10 and was transported to a hospital infectious diseases ward on May 11. The patient was transferred to the National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome on May 12, following confirmation of Ebola.
