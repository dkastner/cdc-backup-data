CDC and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry work together to find out how common autism is in Brick Township and to study the possible relationship of environmental factors to autism in the community. At this time, the prevalence of ASDs in the United States is 6.7 per 1,000 children. The prevalence of autism in Brick Township seems to be higher than that in other studies, particularly other studies conducted in the United States, but within the range of a few recent studies among smaller populations that used more thorough case-finding methods.&#160;</li><li>The CBDRP begin collecting data as part of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a population-based case&#8211;control study to investigate genetic and environmental risk factors for birth defects.&#160;</li><li>Congress passes the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1998, directing CDC to implement programs to collect data on birth defects, operate regional centers for epidemiological research, and provide information to the public about the prevention of birth defects.&#160;</li><li>A CDC-funded study concludes that screening newborns to identify children with sickle cell disease (SCD) reduces early childhood mortality from the disease to very low levels.&#160;</li><li>In Atlanta, Georgia, CDC initiates one of the few programs in the world that conducts active, ongoing monitoring of the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) among children by adding ASDs as a condition monitored through MADDSP.&#160;</li><li>CDC works with the FDA before the first U.S. rerelease of thalidomide, a well-known cause of birth defects, to develop usage guidelines in order to minimize the potential for future birth defects from this medication.&#160;</li><li>NCBDDD initiates Legacy for Children&#8482;, a set of longitudinal, randomized, controlled studies examining the potential for improving child developmental outcomes through parenting programs designed to promote self-efficacy and a sense of community.&#160;</li><li>CDC begins collaborating with approximately 140 federally funded hemophilia treatment centers in the United States and its territories through the Universal Data Collection (UDC) Program to monitor blood product safety and outcomes of care for people with bleeding disorders.&#160;</li><li>The FDA approves hydroxyurea.

<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>The Second National Conference on Blood Disorders in Public Health held to present, discuss, and examine strategies, experiences and techniques that focus on promoting and improving the health of blood disorder populations.</li>

<li>The 2nd Meeting of the Worldwide Initiative on Social Studies on Hemoglobinopathies. Implemented Public Health Research Epidemiology and Surveillance for Hemoglobinopathies (PHRESH), a demonstration project that focuses on three areas: surveillance, health promotion and prevention awareness, and laboratory capacity building. The project is intended to expand upon, and learn more about, the data collected from RuSH and is being piloted in California, Mississippi, and Georgia.</li>

<li>NCBDDD/DBD initiated VTE surveillance by awarding cooperative agreements to Duke University Medical Center and the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center to develop and evaluate pilot programs for population-based surveillance of VTE. Implemented Blood Safety Surveillance among People with Blood Disorders, a pilot project that focuses on infectious and non-infectious complications for those who receive multiple therapeutic transfusions for non-malignant blood disorders.</li>

<li>In recognition that prevention of hospital-associated VTE (HA-VTE) has become a national priority, NCBDDD/DBD convened a stakeholder meeting to inform the development of and assess the need for HA- VTE surveillance to monitor the occurrence of and use of prevention for HA-VTE.</li>

<li>In 2012, NCBDDD publishes <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss6103a1.htm?s_cid=ss6103a1_w">Prevalence of autism spectrum disorders – Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, 14 sites, United States, 2008</a> in CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Findings indicate that about 1 in 88 children in multiple communities in the United States has been identified with an autism spectrum disorder. In 2012, NCBDDD publishes its <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22350336">first scientific</a> article from the Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research and Epidemiology (CADDRE) Network. The publication describes the methods of the Study to Explore Early Development.</li>

<li>In 2012, NCBDDD launches a second phase of the Study to Explore Early Development, currently the largest multisite collaborative study in the United States to help identify factors that may put children at risk for autism spectrum disorder and other developmental disabilities.</li>

<li>In 2012, CDC released a children’s book called <em><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/amazingme">Amazing Me: It’s Busy Being 3!</a></em> This is a story about an amazing 3-year old kangaroo that holds the child’s attention and inspires an interest in books and reading while educating the parent-reader about milestones that are important signs of a child’s development. <em>Amazing Me</em> also encourages the parent-reader to look for milestones in their own child, provides parents a tool to track their child’s development, and encourages parents to talk with their child’s doctor about their child’s development.</li>

<li>In 2012, NCBDDD publishes <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6128a4.htm?s_cid=mm6128a4_e%0d%0a">Alcohol use and binge drinking among women of childbearing age – United States, 2006-2010</a> in CDC’s <em>Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</em> (MMWR). The report describes findings from CDC’s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) examining any alcohol use and binge drinking among pregnant and nonpregnant women of childbearing age (18-44 years) in the U.S. from 2006 to 2010. Findings from these data include that 7.6% of pregnant women (or 1 in 13) and 51.5% of nonpregnant women (or 1 in 2) reported drinking alcohol in the past 30 days.</li>

<li>NCBDDD received funding to enhance and expand public health tracking of congenital heart defects (CHD) across the lifespan. With this new funding, CDC is working on a project with the New York State Department of Health, Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to develop population-based tracking of adolescents and adults with CHD. These tracking activities will help us better understand the survival, healthcare use, and long term outcomes of adolescents and adults affected by CHD. Understanding health issues and needs across the lifespan is vital to improving the lives of individuals born with these conditions.</li>

<li>NCBDDD conducted the first study to look at the costs and health outcomes (cost-effectiveness) of newborn screening for early identification of children with a critical congenital heart defect (CCHD). This information is helpful for state officials considering adding this condition to their existing newborn screening programs.</li>

The report finds that binge drinking is a serious, under-recognized problem among women and high school girls. Some of the key findings include that 1 in 8 adult women and 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink. Binge drinking increases a woman&#8217;s chance of breast cancer, heart disease, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and many other health problems. Drinking during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). &#160;</li><li>NCBDDD launches Birth Defects COUNT, a global initiative to reduce death and lifelong disability due to neural tube defects. Worldwide, more than 300,000 neural tube defects occur each year. Birth Defects COUNT aims to increase folic acid intake among women of reproductive age through fortification and other means. These efforts can help prevent the majority of neural tube defects globally each year. The initiative is supported by three main goals: improve the science base (surveillance, epidemiology, laboratory and prevention capacity) to support prevention efforts; educate and inform on the benefits of fortification policies and other interventions; and enhance strategic partnerships and communication to support prevention strategies. Currently, we are only preventing about 10% of neural tube defects globally through folic acid fortification. The initiative aims to reduce infant and child disability and death resulting from neural tube defects. Birth Defects COUNT will continue to engage key partners in these efforts.&#160;&#160;</li><li>NCBDDD met with partners from other federal agencies, public and private organizations and the public to collaborate on the <em>Treating for Two Initiative: Safer Medication Use in Pregnancy</em>.&#160;&#160;February 2013 &#8211; NCBDDD sent Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers to investigate a birth defects cluster in Washington State. From January 2010 to January 2013, a three-county area of central Washington had four times as many pregnancies affected by anencephaly than were expected based on the most recent U.S. estimates. To look for potential causes, researchers compared women who had a pregnancy affected by anencephaly and those who did not have a pregnancy affected by a birth defect. Researchers did not find differences between the groups.&#160;</li><li>September 2013 &#8211; The Birth Defects Study To Evaluate Pregnancy exposureS (BD-STEPS) is publicly announced. BD-STEPS builds upon the foundation of birth defects research from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). This new study further examines findings from the NBDPS and follows up on leads to understand more about what causes birth defects and how to prevent them. CDC coordinates the Centers for Birth Defects Research and Prevention (CBDRP) to collaborate on BD-STEPS. Participating sites are located in Arkansas, California, Georgia (CDC), Iowa, Massachusetts, New York, and North Carolina.</li></ul></div></div>				</div>
