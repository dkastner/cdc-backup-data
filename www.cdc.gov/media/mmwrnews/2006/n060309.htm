    <p>Since 1995, the

        season also was notable for the wind speed and intensity of the storms
        produced. The combined effect of death, injury, destruction, and population
        displacement from Hurricane Katrina was unprecedented in U.S. history.
        The disaster was compounded when Hurricane Rita made landfall 26 days
      later. The economic and health consequences of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
      extended
        beyond the Gulf region to affect states and communities across the United
        States.</p>    <h3><a name="2"></a>Surveillance for Illness and Injury after Hurricane Katrina &#8211; Three

    <p>The Mississippi Department of Health (MDH) asked CDC to help conduct active
        surveillance at hospital emergency departments (EDs) and federal Disaster
        Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) operation sites in Hancock, Harrison,
      and Jackson counties. On September 4, a team of 17 CDC staff members was
      deployed
        to Mississippi to work with MDH and an epidemiology response team from
        the Florida Department of Health to provide surveillance for injury and
        illness, looking for public health concerns such as outbreaks of infectious
        disease or clusters of preventable injury. No major outbreaks were detected,
        which helped to reassure the MDH and emergency response practitioners
      and public, allowing attention to be focused on immediate needs such as
      food,
        water and shelter. Pre-hurricane preparations might potentially reduce
        the post-hurricane burden on health-care systems by 1) improving tetanus
        booster vaccination coverage, 2) communicating to residents that tetanus
        immunization is not required acutely after disasters, and 3) encouraging
        residents to maintain an emergency travel medical kit with a supply of
        critical medications. For optimal monitoring of illness and injury in
      a post-disaster setting, surveillance should allow for simple, direct electronic
        data entry of key syndromes of public health concern.</p>    <h3><a name="3" id="3"></a>Rapid Community Needs Assessment Following Hurricane Katrina &#8211; Hancock

      problems with
        mosquitoes (49 percent) and trash removal (33 percent). A need for health
        services was also identified. Thirty-four percent (34 percent) of the
      households reported having a member who needed medical care, (29 percent)
      needed prescription
        refills, and (13 percent) reported emotional distress. As a result of
      these findings, the Mississippi Department of Health publicized the names
      and
        locations of functioning medical care facilities, pharmacies and mental
        health services. Restoration of debris removal services, restoration

    <p>More than 10,000 evacuees fleeing
        Hurricane Katrina arrived in San Antonio, Texas, and several thousand
      evacuees remained in evacuation centers 2 weeks after the evacuation. The
      San Antonio
        Metropolitan Health District and CDC conducted a needs assessment to
      help city authorities prepare for evacuees&#8217; future health, housing, and
        social services needs. This assessment of 1,360 heads of household determined
        that 51 percent of evacuee households planned to settle in San Antonio.
        In addition, 42 percent of households had a household member with a chronic
        medical condition, 28 percent had a member with a physical or mental disability,
        and 20 percent had a member needing counseling services. These findings
        helped San Antonio officials plan long-term resources to better assist
        both current and future evacuee populations.</p>    <h3><a name="5"></a>Carbon Monoxide Poisonings after Two Major Hurricanes &#8211; Alabama

        and found that over 50 percent of the poisonings involved generators
      placed
        outside, but close to the home. In half of the poisonings, the generator
        was placed near a window air conditioner, which could potentially bring
        generator exhaust from outside into the home. Portable generators should
        only be used outside far from homes and window air conditioners. </p>    <h3><a name="6"></a>Mortality Associated with Hurricane Katrina &#8211; Florida and Alabama,

    </table>    <p><strong><em>Hurricane related deaths are preventable. Addressing the direct and indirect
      impact of hurricane during preparation, warning, and response period is
      important to prevent hurricane related deaths.</em></strong></p>
    <p> On August 25, 2005, Hurricane
        Katrina made landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura, Florida,
      as a Category 1 hurricane. After crossing southern Florida and entering
      the
        Gulf of Mexico, the hurricane strengthened and made landfall on August
        29 as a strong Category 3 hurricane in southeastern Louisiana. To define
        the impact of the hurricane and to describe the etiology of deaths, CDC
        in collaboration with Florida and Alabama state health department conducted
        a review of mortality records of Florida&#8217;s Medical Examiners Commission
        (FMEC) and the Alabama Department of Forensic Science (ADFS). In Florida,
        the review of death records identified 14 deaths associated with Hurricane
        Katrina. Further this finding indicated that trauma (drowning, hit by tree
        of fallen limb, car collision) directly or indirectly related to the hurricane
        was the leading cause of death, the majority of deaths occurred during
        the impact phase; the rapid (less than 24 hours) strengthening of Katrina
        from a tropical storm to a hurricane and the subsequent landfall later
        the same day might have left many residents unprepared. In Alabama, 24
        deaths were identified as indirectly or possibly related to Hurricane Katrina,
        most of the deaths were attributed to indirect causes, both natural (heart
        disease, sepsis, seizure etc) and traumatic (gunshot, suicide, car collision);
        the majority of these were attributed to natural causes exacerbated by
        the hurricane. Persons with preexisting medical conditions might die when
        access to care is interrupted. Mental stress associated with evacuation,
        changes in residence or work, property damage, and loss of human life might
        increase in communities affected by hurricanes and can lead to suicide
        in persons with a history of psychological problems. (1) 71 percent of
        deaths in Florida were as the result of trauma, drowning and carbon monoxide
        poisoning occurred during impact phase. (2) 54 percent of the deaths in
        Alabama, which occurred in post impact phase, were attributed by underling
        heart and neurological problems. (3) 42 percent of deaths in Alabama were
        related to trauma as a result of gunshot, suicide, car collision and drowning.</p>    <h3><a name="7"></a>      Surveillance for Illness and Rapid Needs Assessment among Hurricane Katrina

      plans to settle in San Antonio, Texas. </em></strong></p>
    <p>More than 10,000 evacuees fleeing
        Hurricane Katrina arrived in San Antonio, Texas, and several thousand
      evacuees remained in evacuation centers 2 weeks after the evacuation. The
      San Antonio
        Metropolitan Health District and CDC conducted a needs assessment to
      help city authorities prepare for evacuees&#8217; future health, housing, and
        social services needs. This assessment of 1,360 heads of household determined
        that 51 percent of evacuee households planned to settle in San Antonio.
        In addition, 42 percent of households had a household member with a chronic
        medical condition, 28 percent had a member with a physical or mental disability,
        and 20 percent had a member needing counseling services. These findings
        helped San Antonio officials plan long-term resources to better assist
        both current and future evacuee populations.</p>    <h3><a name="8"></a>Progress in Reducing Global Measles Deaths, 1999-2004</h3>

        216,000 deaths in 2004. The 45 targeted countries were identified by

        measles mortality by 9 percent by 2010. </p>
