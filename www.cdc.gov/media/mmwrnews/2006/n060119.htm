    </table>    <p>On August 29, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast near
      the Louisiana-Mississippi border, creating devastating storm-surge conditions.
      Storm-induced breeches in the New Orleans levee system resulted in the
      catastrophic flooding of that city. The hurricane disrupted basic utilities,
      food-distribution systems, health-care services, and communications. Hurricane
      Katrina was the deadliest hurricane to strike the United States since 1928.
      The preliminary mortality rates indicate approximately 1,000 Katrina-related
      deaths in Louisiana, 200 in Mississippi, and 20 in Florida, Alabama and
      Georgia. In the days after the hurricane struck, more than 200,000 persons
      congregated in evacuation centers. During and after Hurricane Katrina the
      majority of deaths resulted from storm surges along the Mississippi and
      Louisiana coastline and flooding in the New Orleans area. The situation
      was compounded on September 24, when Hurricane Rita forced the cessation
      of response activities in New Orleans and the evacuation of Louisiana and
      Texas cities near the Gulf. Advances in warning technology and timely evacuation
      have decreased hurricane related mortality. </p>

    <p>No evidence suggests any increased risk for cholera among Gulf Coast
        residents or consumers of Gulf Coast seafood after the hurricanes. Louisiana
        was
          struck by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and by Hurricane Rita
        on September 24, 2005. The two Gulf Coast hurricanes caused unprecedented
          damage from wind and storm surge to the Louisiana coastline, and levee
          breaks caused flooding of large residential areas in New Orleans. With
          the flooding, one of the immediate public health concerns was the potential
          for outbreaks of infectious diseases, including cholera. Cases of cholera
          rarely occur in the United States, and cholera epidemics, such as those
          reported in certain developing countries, are highly unlikely, even with
          the extreme flooding conditions caused by the two hurricanes. No evidence
          suggests any increased risk for cholera among Gulf Coast residents or
        consumers
          of Gulf Coast seafood after the hurricanes. This report describes the
        investigation by the Louisiana Office of Public Health and CDC into two
        cases of toxigenic
          <em>Vibrio cholerae </em>O1 in a Louisiana couple; the cases were attributed to
          consumption of undercooked or contaminated seafood. Although noncholeragenic
          <em>Vibrio </em>illnesses (not cholera) were reported in 22 residents of Louisiana
          and Mississippi, no epidemic of cholera was identified after the hurricanes
          (1 figure).</p>    <h3><a name="3"></a>Update: Injury and Illness Surveillance Following Hurricanes Katrina and

      the New Orleans area, highlights the importance of conducting detailed
      data collection following natural disasters. Understanding Injury and illness

    <p>This report describes injury
          and illness surveillance following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita (September
          8&#8211;25, 2005) and provides frequencies of these events following
          Hurricane Rita and during re-population of the New Orleans area. The
          results indicate
          that 17,446 emergency department visits occurred at participating facilities
          during this period where the proportion of relief workers with acute
          respiratory events and unintentional injuries was higher compared with
          residents. In
          addition, the proportion of falls and motor-vehicle crashes among relief
          workers was lower as compared to residents. Although the initial collection
          of detailed data using a paper-based active surveillance system was
          initially implemented; the burden of such system required the transition
          to an electronic
          syndromic surveillance system that would be more sustainable in the
          long term.</p>    <h3><a name="4"></a>Syndromic Surveillance in Hurricane Evacuation Centers &#8211; Louisiana,

    </table>    <p>Persons who survive natural disasters face numerous physical,
          mental, and social challenges. To identify health-related needs among
          New Orleans area residents after Hurricane Katrina, state and local
      public health and mental health agencies and CDC conducted an assessment
      of
          living conditions, access to basic services, and physical and mental
          health status. This assessment determined that, approximately 7 weeks
          after Hurricane Katrina made landfall, 20.2 percent of housing units
          lacked water, 24.5 percent had no electricity, 43.2 percent had no
      telephone service, and 55.7 percent of households contained one or more
      member
          with a chronic health condition. In addition, 49.8 percent of adults
          exhibited levels of emotional distress indicating a potential need
      for mental health services. As a result of these findings, the Louisiana
          Office of Mental Health established a crisis-counseling program to
      provide
      interventions and support to hurricane survivors.</p>    <h3> <a name="6"></a>Health Concerns

    </table>    <p>For public communications about
        mold, television or radio announcements are recommended in both Spanish
        and English along with education of employees in stores that sell respiratory
        protection. After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita made landfall on August
      29 and September 24, 2005, many buildings in the New Orleans area were
      damaged
        by rain and flooding, leading to extensive mold growth in buildings.
      Visible mold growth was evident and growth of mold and bacteria was above
      levels
        reported to be associated with health effects, yet residents and remediation
        workers did not consistently use appropriate respiratory protection.
      Public health interventions should emphasize the importance of safe mold
      removal
        and clean-up practices and ensure the availability of recommended personal
        protective equipment. Specifically, measures to increase awareness of
      the need for the use of protective equipment by the public are warranted.
      Television
        and radio announcements and educational sessions conducted for and by
      employees of stores that sell respirators should emphasize the importance
      of appropriate
        respiratory protection. Relevant occupational safety training for remediation
        workers should be supported by their employers.</p>    <h3>      <a name="7"></a>High Levels of Adamantane Resistance Among Influenza A (H3N2) Viruses and
