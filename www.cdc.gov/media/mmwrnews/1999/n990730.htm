    ranks as one of the 10 major public health achievements of the 20<sup>th</sup> 
    century, only smallpox has been eradicated globally. New infectious diseases 
    continue to emerge and old ones recur, sometimes in outbreaks and pandemics. 
    The control of infectious diseases is an achievement that can never be 
    considered accomplished because infectious agents (microbes) continually 
    evolve and adapt. The average life span of Americans increased by 30 years 
    in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Much of this increase is attributable to the 
    control of infectious diseases. However, the worst epidemic in history 
    occurred in 1918-19, when pandemic flu killed 25 million people worldwide, 
    including 500,000 in the United States. Infectious diseases continue to 
    emerge and reemerge and represent a threat to public health both in the 
    United States and globally.</td>

    increased from 1993 to 1997 and then declined in 1998 to rates similar to 
    those reported in the United States. Rhode Island had a significantly higher 
    case-fatality rate than other states. From November 1997 to February 1998, 
    Rhode Island reported a cluster of cases of meningococcal disease with 
    several different serogroups. Although this cluster did not constitute an 
    outbreak as defined by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a 
    statewide vaccination program was initiated. Although some cases may be 
    prevented by this approach, this overall impact is likely to be limited 
    because of the limitations of currently available meningococcal vaccines. 
    Improved control and prevention of sporadic cases of meningococcal disease 
    will require improved vaccines. New meningococcal conjugate vaccines will be 
    used routinely in the United Kingdom this year and should be available in 
    the United States within 2-4 years.</td>

    successful in southern Sudan and Somalia even in the absence of a formal 
    negotiated cease-fire. In northern Somalia in August- September 1998, and in 
    southern and central Somalia in November - December 1998, over 1.5 million 
    children under five years of age were immunized against polio and 1.3

    <p><strong><em>In 1996, the number of legal induced abortions remained at 
     about the same level as in 1995; however, the national abortion rate and 
     abortion ratios continue to be at an all-time low.</em></strong><br>
     In 1996, 1,221,585 legal, induced abortions were reported to CDC, 
     representing a slight increase (0.9%) from the number reported in 1995. As 
     in 1995, the 1996 national abortion rate of 20 per 1,000 women of 
     reproductive age (aged 15-44 years) continues to be the lowest rate 
     recorded since 1975. The national abortion ratio (number of legal abortions 
     per 1000 live births) increased slightly from 311 in 1995 to 314 in 1996 
     and is at the lowest recorded level since 1976. CDC receives data on legal 
     induced abortions from the 50 states, New York City and the District of 
     Columbia. Women who obtained legal abortions in 1996, as in previous years, 
     were predominantly white, and unmarried. As in 1995, most women obtaining a 
     legal induced abortion in 1996 were 20 years and older; about one-fifth of 
     women who obtained abortions were aged 19 years or younger.</td>

    <ul>
      <li>Deaths from infectious diseases declined markedly in the United States 
      during the 20th century, contributing to a sharp drop in infant and child 
      mortality and a &gt;30-year average increase in life expectancy. In 1900, 30% 
      of children died before their fifth birthdays; in 1997, only 1% died. </li>
      <li>In 1900, the three leading causes of death were pneumonia, 
      tuberculosis (TB), and diarrhea and enteritis, which (together with 
      diphtheria) were responsible for one third of all deaths. Of these deaths, 
      40% were deaths of children aged &lt;5 years. Today, heart disease and 
      cancers account for almost three quarters of deaths, with 5% attributable 
      to pneumonia, flu, and HIV infection. </li>
      <li>One of the most devastating epidemics in human history occurred during 
      the 20th century. The the 1918 flu pandemic killed 20 million people, 
      including 500,000 persons in the United States, in less than 1 year. </li>
      <li>Chlorination and other treatments of drinking water began in the early 
      1900s and became widespread 20th century public health practices, 
      decreasing the incidence of cholera, typhoid, and other waterborne 
      diseases. </li>
      <li>In 1900, TB killed 200 out of every 100,000 Americans, most of them 
      residents of urban areas. In 1940 (before the introduction of antibiotic 
      therapy) TB remained a leading killer, but the death rate had decreased to 
      60 per 100,000 persons </li>
      <li>Malaria, which had been endemic throughout the U.S. Sunbelt 
      (southeastern and south-central states), was reduced to negligible levels 
      by the late 1940s through regional mosquito control programs. </li>
      <li>The last major rat-associated outbreak of plague in the United States 
      occurred in 1924-1925 in Los Angeles. This outbreak included the last 
      identified instance of human-to-human transmission of plague (through 
      inhalation of infectious respiratory droplets from coughing patients) in 
      this country. </li>
      <li>By 1900, 40 states had established public health departments, and the 
      first county health departments were established in 1908. Between the 
      1930s and 1950s, state and local health departments made substantial 
      progress in disease prevention activities including sewage disposal, water 
      treatment, food safety, and public education on hygienic practices (e.g., 
      food handling and handwashing). </li>
      <li>Over the past 50 years, strategic vaccination campaigns have virtually 
      eliminated diseases that used to be common in the United States -- 
      including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, smallpox, 
      measles, mumps, rubella, and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b 
      meningitis. </li>
      <li>A federally coordinated vaccination program was established through 
      the passage of the Vaccination Assistance Act of 1962. A landmark piece of 
      legislation, this Act has been continuously renewed and now supports the 
      purchase and administration of a full range of childhood vaccines. </li>
      <li>Smallpox was eradicated in 1980, after an 11-year campaign (1967-1977) 
      involving 33 nations, approximately one decade after it had been 
      eliminated from the United States and the rest of the Western Hemisphere. 
      Polio and dracunculiasis may be eradicated by 2000. </li>
      <li>Antibiotics have been in civilian use for 57 years and have saved the 
      lives and health of hundreds of thousands of persons with infections such 
      as streptococcal and staphylococcal infections, gonorrhea, and syphilis.
      </li>
      <li>New diseases that have emerged during the 20th century include 
      hepatitis C, Lyme disease, human ehrlichiosis, hantavirus pulmonary 
      syndrome, AIDS, Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers, new variant 
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Nipah virus disease. </li>
      <li>Recent examples of microbial evolution include the emergence of a 
      virulent strain of avian influenza in Hong Kong; the multidrug-resistant W 
      strain of TB in the United States; and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> with 
      reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in the United States and Japan. </li>
      <li>Between 1980 and 1994 there was an overall increase in infectious 
      disease mortality in the United States, due in part to the emergence of 
      AIDS and the re-emergence of TB (including multi-drug resistant TB). </li>
      <li>Current research suggests that infectious agents may cause or 
      intensify certain chronic diseases, including some types of diabetes, 
      cancers, and heart conditions. </li>
