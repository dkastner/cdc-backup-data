    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->Human albumin is a sterile solution used in the 
    management of several medical conditions. It is available in various 
    concentrations, all of them formulated for immediate infusion without 
    admixture. Large volumes of 5% albumin are commonly used during therapeutic 
    plasma exchange. When commercial 5% albumin is not available, 25% albumin 
    diluted to a 5% concentration with 0.9% NaCl or, when sodium load is of 
    concern, 5% glucose can be used. If sterile water is used as the diluent, 
    the final product will be hypotonic. Hemolysis may occur as a result of 
    infusing hypotonic solutions to patients, and it can be associated with 
    several complications. Since 1994, in the United States, 10 patients have 
    been reported to suffer hemolysis associated with the infusion of 25% 
    albumin diluted with sterile water for injection. Of these, six developed 
    acute renal failure and another one disseminated intravascular coagulopathy 
    that resulted in death.</td>

    Administration (FDA) estimates that in 1997 there was a 20% IGIV shortfall, 
    and in 1998 a 30% shortfall. FDA attributes the shortage to production 
    problems, withdrawals for risk of contamination with Creutzfeldt-Jakob 
    Disease (CJD), export of IGIV, changes in packaging, and increased use for 
    both FDA-approved and non-approved indications. The FDA sent a letter to 
    doctors reminding them of the six approved uses for IGIV, and recommended 
    that priority for IGIV use be given to patients who have FDA-approved 
    indications for its use. </td>

    <!-- mmwr3 synopsis -->Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection is a rare but 
    serious cause of hospital-acquired postpartum and postoperative infections. 
    GAS may be transmitted to patients by asymptomatic healthcare workers who 
    are carrying the organism. When a single episode of postoperative or 
    postpartum GAS is identified, enhanced surveillance and epidemiologic 
    investigation, including screening of healthcare workers, may prevent 
    additional cases. Healthcare workers identified as carriers should refrain 
    from patient care while being treated. The majority of GAS infections are 
    relatively mild illnesses, such as &quot;strep throat&quot; or impetigo. Occasionally, 
    however, these bacteria can reach parts of the body where bacteria are not 
    usually found, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue, or the lungs, 
    and can cause invasive infections.</td>

    <h2><font face="Arial Narrow,Arial" size="5">Group A Streptococcus</font></h2>

     CDC, Division of Media Relations<br>

    <p><font>Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a bacterium commonly found in the 
     throat and on the skin. GAS can be present in the throat or on the skin and 
     cause no symptoms of disease.</font></p>
    <p><font>The majority of GAS infections are relatively mild, such as &quot;strep 
     throat&quot; or impetigo. Occasionally, however, these bacteria can reach parts 
     of the body where bacteria are not usually found, such as the blood, deep 
     muscle and fat tissue, or the lungs, and can cause invasive infections.</font></p>
    <p><font>GAS is spread by direct contact with secretions from the nose and 
     throat of infected persons or by contact with infected wounds or sores on 
     the skin. The risk of spreading the infection is highest when a person is 
     ill, such as with &quot;strep throat&quot; or an infected wound.</font></p>
    <p><font>Two of the most severe but least common forms of invasive GAS 
     disease are necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. 
     Necrotizing fasciitis (sometimes described as &quot;the flesh-eating bacteria&quot;) 
     is a destructive infection of muscle and fat tissue. Streptococcal toxic 
     shock syndrome is a rapidly progressing infection causing shock and injury 
     to internal organs such as the kidneys, liver, and lungs.</font></p>
    <p><font>CDC estimates that 500 to 1,500 cases of necrotizing fasciitis and 
     2,000 to 3,000 cases of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome occur each year 
     in the United States. Approximately 20% of patients with necrotizing 
     fasciitis die, and 60% of patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome 
     die. In contrast, several million persons get &quot;strep throat&quot; and impetigo 
     annually.</font></p>
    <p><font>Few people who come in contact with a virulent strain of GAS will 
     develop invasive GAS disease; many will have a routine throat or skin 
     infection, and most will have no symptoms whatsoever.</font></p>
    <p><font>GAS infections can be treated with many different antibiotics. 
     Early treatment may reduce the risk of death in cases of invasive disease, 
     although even appropriate therapy does not prevent death in every case. It 
     is always important to complete the entire course of antibiotics as 
     prescribed.</font></p>
    <p><font>The spread of all types of GAS infections may be reduced by good 
     handwashing, especially after coughing and sneezing, before preparing foods 
     and before eating. Persons with sore throats should be seen by a doctor who 
     can perform tests to find out whether it is &quot;strep throat&quot;; if so, the 
     person should stay home from work, school, or day care until 24 hours or 
     more after taking an antibiotic. All wounds should be kept clean and 
     watched for possible signs of infection: increasing redness, swelling, 
     drainage, and pain at the wound site. A person with signs of an infected 
     wound, especially if fever develops, should seek medical care.</font></td>
