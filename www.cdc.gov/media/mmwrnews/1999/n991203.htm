      Fertility rates in the United States decreased in the 19th and 20th centuries as couples chose
      to limit family size. Smaller family size and longer birth intervals have contributed to
      improved health of infants, children and women, and improved the social and economic roles for
      women. The most common methods of contraception have changed dramatically over the past 50
      years, from the condom in 1955 to oral contraceptives in 1965, and female sterilization today.
      Condom use rose dramatically during the 1980s and 1990s, especially among teens. While
      unintended pregnancy remains high in the United States (49% of all pregnancies), publicly
      supported family planning services are estimated to prevent 1.3 million unintended pregnancies
      annually. Modern contraceptive methods have contributed to a 17% decline in the worldwide
      fertility rate in the past decade.</td>

      In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 23 countries are actively working to eliminate measles
      from the region. The measles elimination strategies are 1) achieving and maintaining routine
      measles vaccination coverage at &gt;=95% among 1-year-old children, 2) conducting a one-time
      mass vaccination campaign (catch-up program), 3) conducting periodic national follow-up
      campaigns, and 4) strengthening measles surveillance and laboratory confirmation of cases. In
      14 of the 23 countries, a total of 13 million children have been vaccinated. Before the
      introduction of vaccination in the early 1980s, approximately 200,000 measles cases were
      reported each year from those 14 countries (except Palestine). Once vaccination programs
      began, the reported number of measles cases decreased from 184,000 (in 1980) to 61,000 (in
      1985).

      In 1998, 15,935 people died and 305, 000 were injured in alcohol-related traffic crashes in
      the United States. During 1988-1998, the proportion of all traffic fatalities that were
      alcohol-related decreased from 50% to 38%, and the rate of alcohol-related traffic fatalities
      declined from 9.7 to 5.9 per 100,000 people. However, the percentage of alcohol-related deaths
      has remain constant at 38.4% in 1998 and 38.5% in 1997. The national health objective for 2000
      for alcohol-related motor vehicle deaths is 5.5 per 100,000 persons. A fatal crash is
      considered alcohol-related by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) if
      either a driver or nonoccupant (e.g., pedestrian) had a blood alcohol concentration of
      &gt;0.01% grams per deciliter in a police-reported traffic crash. December is &quot;National
      Drunk and Drugged Driving Prevention Month.&quot;

      <ul>
        <li>In 1900 the average mother gave birth to 3.5 children, and 6-9 of every 1,000 women died
          in childbirth. One in 5 children died before their 5th birthday.
        <li>Family size declined from 7.0 children to 3.5 between1800-1900. During the Great
          Depression, it declined further to 2.3, until the baby boom of the 1940s and 1950s when
          family size peaked at 3.7.
        <li>The Comstock laws enacted in the late 1800s outlawed the distribution of information
          about contraception and contraceptive devices.
        <li>In 1916 Margaret Sanger, a public health nurse and birth control activist, opened the
          first family planning clinic in Brooklyn. Her subsequent legal battles paved the way for
          birth control to come under the professional control of physicians.
        <li>71% of women born between 1901 and 1910 reported using contraception. The most common
          forms were condoms, douches, withdrawal, rhythm and diaphragm.
        <li>Modern methods of contraception began in 1960 with the development of the birth control
          pill and intrauterine device (IUD). Surgical sterilization which became more common after
          1965 is now the most widely used contraceptive method in the US.
        <li>Federal funding for family planning services was authorized in 1970 by Title X of the
          Public Health Service Act. Medicaid funding was authorized in 1972.
        <li>In 1994, 3,119 agencies operated 7,122 family planning clinic sites serving about 6.6
          million women. These services prevented an estimated 1.3 million unintended pregnancies,
          534,000 unintended births, 632,000 abortions and 165,000 miscarriages.
        <li>Barrier methods of contraception such as condoms help protect against sexually
          transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS.
        <li>Oral contraceptives reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, cancers of the ovary
          and endometrium, recurrent ovarian cysts, benign breast cysts and fibroadenomas, and
          discomfort from menstrual cramps.
        <li>Even though notable declines in the worldwide fertility rate have been observed in the
          past decade, particularly in Asia and Latin America (24%), worldwide population growth has
          been a central concern of this century. The world's population was 1.6 billion in 1900. On
          October 12, 1999, the 6 billionth baby was born.
        <li>With an overall17% decline in fertility in the developing world, the rate of infant
          mortality has fallen approximately 150 deaths per 1,000 live births in the 1950s to about
          80 per 1,000 in the early1990s.
        <li>Family planning services offer opportunities for health screening counseling and
          treatment for such diseases as cervical and breast cancer, sexually transmitted diseases
          (STD) and HIV/AIDS.
        <li>49% of pregnancies are unintended and 54% of these end in abortion.
        <li>Teenage pregnancy rates remain high and the proportion of births to unmarried teens
          continued to increase in the 1990s.
        <li>An estimated 12 million new STDs occur each year in the United States; mostly among
          adolescents and young adults.
        <li>The growth of managed care is rapidly changing patterns of health care delivery. In the
          late 1990s, 19 states mandated partial or comprehensive insurance coverage for reversible
          methods of contraception such as birth control pills and IUDs.
