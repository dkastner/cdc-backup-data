      Most women still don't know that the B-vitamin folic acid can prevent some serious birth
      defects. Even fewer women know that folic acid must be taken <em>before</em> and during the
      first few weeks of pregnancy. Most women do not get any information about folic acid from
      their physician. It has been almost 8 years since the Public Health Service recommended that
      all women capable of becoming pregnant should consume 400 micrograms of folic acid everyday to
      prevent serious birth defects of the spine and brain, but little progress has been made toward
      preventing these birth defects. CDC, March of Dimes and the National Council on Folic Acid are
      launching an education outreach with public service announcement messages called --
      &quot;Before You Know It&quot; -- to get this important message to women and their health care

      In March 1999, Angola reported 21 cases (3 deaths) of acute flaccid paralysis. By early April,
      there were 102 cases; by April 26<sup>th</sup> there were 562 cases. The Angola Ministry of
      Health (MOH) found that most of these cases were among children less than 5 years of age; 90%
      had received two or fewer doses of oral polio vaccine.<strong> </strong>The MOH soon began a
      vaccination campaign to control the epidemic. With war intensifying in the region at the end
      of 1998, large groups of displaced persons settled in crowed areas where sanitation is poor
      and water supplies inadequate -- an ideal environment for the spread of polio. Travelers to
      Angola are advised to review their polio vaccination history; ensuring that they have
      completed a primary series of three doses before beginning their travel.

      Over 200,000 U.S. children receive emergency department care for playground injuries each
      year. As part of a national action plan to prevent such injuries, the National Program for
      Playground Safety conducted a survey of the nation's child care, elementary school, and park
      playgrounds. Results indicated that safety measures focusing on supervision, age-appropriate
      design of equipment, fall surfacing, and equipment maintenance should be implemented to reduce
      the number of playground injuries. Further information on the survey and safer playgrounds is

      Investigations of six deaths on Minnesota farms between 1994-1997 show that younger
      agricultural workers are at-risk for injuries similar to those incurred by adult workers
      (e.g.; being struck by farm wagons, implements, or machine parts; tractor overturn; and
      suffocation in grain bins). Although youth under 16 years of age employed on farms are covered
      by provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, these protections do not apply to children
      working on their family's farm. Children working in agriculture are permitted to perform tasks
      prohibited in other industries. Exposure to agricultural machinery poses a particularly
      serious injury risk for young workers. CDC, National Institute for Occupational Safety &amp;
      Health recommends that in assigning work tasks to youth, farm managers and parents evaluate
      the youth's training, experience, maturity, physical ability.

      Singapore since abattoirs were closed, and the decrease in cases in Malaysia coincides with

      From Health Care Providers and Others to Encourage Women to Take Folic Acid Every Day</font></h2>
      <p align="right"><strong>April 30, 1999</strong><br>
      CDC, Division of Media Relations<br>
      (404) 639-3286
      <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a report today showing that
      most women of childbearing age still do not know that taking 400 mcg (.4 mg)* of the B-vitamin
      folic acid every day throughout their childbearing years will prevent neural tube birth
      defects in their children.</p>
      <p>The report, authored by staff of the March of Dimes (MOD), and CDC's Division of Birth
      Defects and Pediatric Genetics Division, was published in CDC's <em>Morbidity and Mortality
      Weekly Report</em>. It shows that of the women studied, only 13% knew that folic acid helps
      prevent birth defects, and only 7% knew that it should be taken before pregnancy to prevent
      the birth defects. Of those who knew that folic acid prevents neural tube birth defects, 31%
      received their information from print media, 23% from radio or television, and only 19%
      received the information from their health care providers. &quot;Women need to know about the
      lifesaving potential of folic acid but not enough are hearing about it from their health care
      providers,&quot; said Jennifer L. Howse, Ph.D., President, March of Dimes Birth Defects
      Foundation.</p>
      <p>&quot;Recent focus group research conducted by CDC revealed that most health care providers
      don't talk to their female patients about birth defect prevention <em>before</em> they get
      pregnant,&quot; said Katherine Lyon Daniel, Ph.D., Behavioral Scientist, CDC, Birth Defects
      and Pediatric Genetics Division. In addition, CDC identified the need for more educational
      materials to assist health care providers to inform women about taking folic acid before and
      during pregnancy to prevent neural tube defects.</p>
      <p>CDC, MOD, and the National Council on Folic Acid will kick-off an educational campaign
      entitled, &quot;Before You Know It&quot; on Mother's Day which will include a series of public
      service announcements and other outreach activities to both health care providers and women.
      The key message is to urge women in their childbearing years to take 400 micrograms of folic
      acid every day before and during pregnancy to reduce their risk of having a baby born with
      neural tube birth defects.</p>
      <p>&quot;Women of childbearing years should be getting 400 micrograms daily,&quot; said J.
      David Erickson, DDS, Ph.D., Acting Director, CDC, Birth Defects and Pediatric Genetics
      Division.</p>
      <p>CDC and the National Council on Folic Acid estimate that if folic acid were taken by all
      women of childbearing years every day prior to conception and throughout the early stages of
      pregnancy, the incidence of neural tube birth defects could be reduced by 50% to 70%.</p>
      <p>Neural tube birth defects affect an estimated 4,000 pregnancies each year. The most common
      of these defects is spina bifida, the leading cause of childhood paralysis. Another is
      anencephaly, which affects the brain and results in miscarriage, stillbirth, or babies who
      live only a few days.</p>
      <p>To prevent these birth defects, women must have sufficient folic acid in the body when they
      become pregnant. &quot;The critical time when folic acid is needed is in the very first days
      of pregnancy, usually before a woman knows that she is pregnant,&quot; said Dr. Erickson,
      &quot;and this is well before her first prenatal visit.&quot;</p>
      <p>Experts advise that women consume foods fortified with folic acid like breakfast cereals,
      enriched breads and pastas, in addition to a balanced diet including foods rich in folate,
      such as leafy green vegetables, orange juice, and beans.</p>
      <p>Although it is possible to get enough folic acid from fortified foods, it is not easy. Most
      experts caution that it may be difficult to maintain the daily requirement without taking a
      folic acid pill or multivitamin.</p>
