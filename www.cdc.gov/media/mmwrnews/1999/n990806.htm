    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->In one of the major public health achievements of the 
    20<sup>th</sup> century, age-adjusted death rates from cardiovascular 
    diseases have declined 60% since 1950 and account for approximately 73% of 
    the decline in all causes of deaths during the same period. In 1996, there 
    were 621,000 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease than would have been 
    expected had the rate remained at its 1963 peak. Trends associated with 
    fewer deaths from heart disease and stroke include the decline in cigarette 
    smoking, decreases in blood pressure levels in the U.S. population, an 
    increase in the percentage of people with hypertension who have the 
    condition under control, and decreased levels of cholesterol in the blood. 
    Despite this remarkable progress, significant challenges in battling heart 
    disease and stroke remain to be addressed to reduce racial, ethnic, gender, 
    and socioeconomic gaps in heart disease and stroke deaths.</td>

    The proportion of nonsusceptible isolates ranged from 15.3% in Maryland to 
    38.3% in Tennessee. Despite the regional variation in resistance, all 
    regions showed a wide range of resistance among individual hospitals. For 
    example, in Connecticut hospitals, the proportion of nonsusceptible <em>S. 
    pneumoniae</em> ranged from 0 to 39.1%. Drug-resistant <em>S. pneumoniae</em> 
    has become more common the United States, increasing from 14 percent in

    <!-- mmwr3 synopsis -->This article presents the findings of an

    Ivanovo (Russia) from 1995 to 1998. As part of an international 
    collaboration with the World Health Organization and others, CDC 
    investigated high levels of treatment failure and drug resistance to two or 
    more first-line therapies (isoniazid and rifampin) among 514 reported 
    never-treated cases in this community. The percentage of P-MDRTB cases more 
    than doubled from 3.8% to 9.4% between 1996 and 1998. This study underscores 
    the need for additional program strategies in areas with drug resistance, 
    including improved TB treatment supervision and greater availability of 
    second-line TB therapies. These efforts have already been initiated to 
    improve treatment outcomes in current TB patients and prevent the further 
    spread of MDR-TB. Global efforts to reach such cases remain critical to 
    worldwide control of TB. </td>

    <p>The decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke during the 20<sup>th</sup> 
     century is an important public health achievement. Dramatic improvements in 
     health and overall life expectancy have been observed as a result of the 
     overall 60 percent decline in cardiovascular disease death rates since 
     1950. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Age-adjusted death rates for diseases of the heart have fallen 56 
      percent from 1950 to 1996; stroke rates declined 70 percent during the 
      same period.</li>
      <li>The decline in total cardiovascular disease death rates accounts for 
      approximately 73 percent of the decline in all causes of deaths in the 
      last half century.</li>
      <li>In 1996, there were 621,000 fewer deaths from coronary heart disease 
      than would have been expected had the rate remained at its 1963 peak.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Prevention efforts and improvements in early detection, treatment and 
     care are associated with the declining rates. Trends which have contributed 
     to the decline in deaths from heart disease and stroke include the 
     following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A decline in cigarette smoking among adults 18 and older from about 42 
      percent in 1965 to 25 percent in 1995.</li>
      <li>A decrease in mean blood pressure levels and blood cholesterol levels 
      in the U.S. population and an increase in the percentage of persons having 
      hypertension that is treated and controlled.</li>
      <li>Less consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol, and a decrease in 
      blood cholesterol levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite these advances, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause 
     of deaths and a major cause of disability in the United States. The overall 
     decline masks important differences in death rates by race-ethnicity, sex, 
     socioeconomic status and geographic region. Also, evidence suggests that 
     some important trends have leveled off or are reversing. For example, death 
     rates from stroke have remained stable or have even slightly increased 
     during the 1990s.</td>
