    1999, based on early surveillance reports of intussusception (a type of 
    bowel obstruction) among some infants who received rotavirus vaccine. 
    Although intussusceptions occur among infants who have not received 
    rotavirus vaccine, CDC will be collecting additional data in the next 
    several months that may indicate more clearly whether the rotavirus vaccine 
    increases the risk of intussusception. An estimated 1.5 million doses of 
    rotavirus vaccine have been administered to infants since it was licensed on 
    August 31, 1998. As of July 7, 1999, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting 
    System has received 15 reports of intussusception. Although cases of 
    intussusception following rotavirus vaccine have been reported, it has not 
    been established that these cases were caused by the vaccine.</td>

    <p>On June 17, 1999, the ACIP recommended that an all inactivated polio 
     vaccine (IPV) schedule for routine childhood polio immunization be used in 
     the United States. As of January 1, 2000, all children should receive four 
     doses of IPV at 2 months, 4 months, 6-18 months, and 4-6 years of age. Oral 
     polio vaccine should be used only for special circumstances:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Salmonell</em>a is actually a group of bacteria that can cause 
      diarrheal illness in people. <em>Salmonella</em> has been known to cause 
      illness in people for over 100 years.</li>
      <li>Every year, approximately 800,000 to 4 million cases of <em>Salmonella</em> 
      result in 500 deaths in the United States. Children are the most likely to 
      get <em>Salmonella</em>. Young children, the elderly, and the 
      immunocompromised are the most likely to have severe infections.</li>
      <li>Symptoms of <em>Salmonella</em> include diarrhea, fever, and abdominal 
      cramps that develop 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually 
      lasts 4 to 7 days, and most persons recover without treatment.</li>
      <li>If the patient becomes severely dehydrated or the infection spreads 
      from the intestines. Persons with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, 
      often with intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are not usually necessary 
      unless the infection spreads from the intestines.</li>
      <li><em>Salmonella</em> passes from the feces of people or animals, to 
      other people or other animals. There are many different kinds of <em>
      Salmonella</em> bacteria. <em>Salmonella</em> serotype Typhimurium and <em>
      Salmonella</em> serotype Enteritidis are the most common in the United 
      States.</li>
      <li>Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Contaminated foods 
      are often of animal origin, such as beef, poultry, milk, or eggs, but all 
      foods, including vegetables may become contaminated. Food may also become 
      contaminated by the unwashed hands of an infected person handling such 
      food.</li>
      <li><em>Salmonella</em> may also be found in the feces of some pets. 
      Reptiles are particularly likely to harbor the bacteria.</li>
      <li>Some <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria have become resistant to 
      antibiotics, largely as a result of the use of antibiotics to promote the 
      growth of feed animals.</li>
      <li>There is no vaccine to prevent <em>Salmonella</em>. Therefore, to 
      prevent infection</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not eat raw or undercooked eggs, poultry, or meat. Raw eggs may 
        be unrecognized in some foods such as homemade hollandaise sauce, caesar 
        and other salad dressings, tiramisu, homemade ice cream, homemade 
        mayonnaise, cookie dough, and frostings. </li>
        <li>Poultry and meat, including hamburgers, should be well-cooked, not 
        pink in the middle. Persons also should not consume raw or unpasteurized 
        milk or other dairy products. Produce should be thoroughly washed before 
        consuming.</li>
        <li>Cross-contamination of foods should be avoided. Uncooked meats 
        should be keep separate from produce, cooked foods, and ready-to-eat 
        foods. Hands, cutting boards, counters, knives, and other utensils 
        should be washed thoroughly after handling uncooked foods. Hand should 
        be washed before handling any food, and between handling different food 
        items.</li>
        <li>Persons infected with <em>Salmonella </em>should not prepare food or 
        pour water for others until they have been shown to no longer be 
        carrying the <em>Salmonella</em> bacterium.</li>
        <li>Wash your hands after contact with animal feces. Since reptiles are 
        particularly likely to have <em>Salmonella</em>, everyone should 
        immediately wash their hands after handling reptiles. Reptiles 
        (including turtles) are not appropriate pets for small children and 
        should not be in the same house as an infant.</li>
