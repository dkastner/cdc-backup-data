    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->Overall, the proportion of the U.S. population &gt;= 65 
    years that has lost all natural teeth has been dropping for the past several 
    decades. However, there remain substantial differences in the prevalence of 
    total tooth loss among the states, with a greater than three-fold difference 
    between the lowest (Hawaii, 13.9%) and the highest (West Virginia, 47.9%). 
    Total tooth loss disproportionately affected particular segments of older 
    Americans: African-Americans, those without dental insurance, those with 
    less education, and cigarette smokers. Loss of natural teeth is not an 
    inevitable consequence of aging and is largely preventable. Strategies to 
    prevent total tooth loss include fluoridation of community water to prevent 
    tooth decay, expansion of dental insurance coverage, and appropriate use of 
    dental care services. Other preventive measures include the use of 
    toothpastes and mouth rinses containing fluoride or antibacterial agents, 
    and avoiding the use of tobacco.</td>

    Pennsylvania. Symptoms typically developed within 1 hour of eating a burrito 
    and included nausea, headache, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. The burritos 
    were from two unrelated companies. All of the burritos were made with wheat 
    flour tortillas, but the filling differed in three outbreaks, suggesting the 
    tortillas contain the agent that caused illness. The CDC, FDA, and USDA are 
    collaborating to identify the etiologic agent; thus far, extensive 
    laboratory testing has failed to identify the cause of this outbreak. The 
    suspect burritos were removed from the market and no outbreaks have been

      <li>Rotavirus affects virtually all children in both developed and 
      developing countries during the first 5 years of life, and Rotavirus 
      infection is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis (diarrhea and 
      vomiting) during winter in the United States.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Rotavirus is a common cause of hospitalizations (50,000 annually) and 
      emergency room and outpatient clinic visits (500,000 annually) in this 
      country. An estimated 20 children die from rotavirus gastroenteritis 
      annually. Most hospitalizations and outpatient visits for severe rotavirus 
      diarrhea and dehydration occur among children 3 to 35 months of age.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>In the United States, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for an 
      estimated $264 million in direct medical costs and more than $1 billion in 
      total costs to society.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The vaccine was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration on August 
      31, 1998. Clinical trials of the vaccine indicated it prevented 
      approximately 50% of all episodes of rotavirus diarrhea and 70-90% of 
      severe episodes. The vaccine was associated with fever following the first 
      dose in some recipients, usually occurring 3 to 5 days after 
      administration and lasting for 24 hours or less. The fever was 
      occasionally associated with decreased appetite, irritability, and 
      decreased activity.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The vaccine is an oral live rotavirus preparation that should be given 
      to infants between the ages of 6 weeks and 1 year. The recommended 
      schedule is a three-dose series, with doses to be given at 2, 4, and 6 
      months of age. The first dose may be administered from the ages of 6 weeks 
      to 6 months and later doses should be given at least 3 weeks apart. The 
      entire series needs to be completed before the first birthday. Special 
      efforts should be made to vaccinate children before onset of the winter 
      rotavirus season.</font>
