    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->Work-related injury fatalities have dropped 
    dramatically, both overall and in particularly high-risk industries like 
    mining. If workers in the late 1990s were still dying at rates experienced 
    in the 1930s, an additional 40,000 lives would be lost each year to 
    workplace injuries. This progress has been achieved through the efforts of 
    workers, unions, employers, government agencies, and others by such means as 
    research, education and training, and regulatory actions. The mechanisms of 
    change have ranged from physical workplace modifications like improved 
    ventilation and safer equipment to the introduction of safer work practices 
    and better training of workers . For example, since the first decades of 
    this century, various safety measures have reduced the average number of 
    U.S. miners killed annually in coal mine fires and explosions (from an 
    average of 477 deaths per year in 1906-1910 to fewer than 3 deaths per year 
    in 1991-1995).</td>

    <!-- mmwr2 synopsis -->During 1979-1996, exposure to extreme hot 
    temperatures caused an annual average of 381 deaths in the United States. 
    Persons at increased risk for heat-related illness and death include the 
    very young (infants), the elderly (<u>&gt;</u>65 years); persons with impaired 
    mobility; persons physically active in hot environments, who fail to rest 
    frequently or drink enough fluids; and persons using certain drugs which 
    impair thermoregulatory function or inhibit perspiration. In addition, 
    excessive alcohol consumption can cause dehydration and be a predisposing 
    risk factor. This report describes four instances of heat-related deaths 
    that occurred in the State of Missouri in 1998, summarizes U. S. 
    heat-related deaths during 1979-1996, and describes the risk factors

    <p>At the beginning of this century, workers in the United States faced 
     remarkably high health and safety risks on the job. Through the efforts of 
     individual workers, unions, employers, government agencies, academic 
     researchers, and others, considerable progress has been made in improving 
     safety and health at work. If workers today had the same risk of dying from 
     injuries as workers in the 1930's, an additional 40,000 lives would be lost 
     each year. Despite the success achieved to date, much work remains to be 
     done, with the ultimate goal that all workers have a productive and safe 
     working life and a retirement free from occupational disease and injury.</p>
    <p>While historical data are limited, the following information highlights 
     the overall declines in occupational fatalities during this century.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Decreases in fatal occupational injuries</em></strong></p>
    <p>From July 1906 through June 1907 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, 195 
     steelworkers died in workplace incidents. In 1997, workplace incidents 
     killed 17 steelworkers nationwide.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>From 1911 through 1997, approximately 103,000 miners died at work. 
      From 1911 through 1915, there were an average of 3329 mining deaths per 
      year, corresponding to an overall average annual fatality rate of 329 per 
      100,000 workers for this industry. Over the century, the injury fatality 
      rates for miners have decreased nearly 13-fold, to 25 per 100,000 during 
      1996-97. The corresponding average annual number of deaths in the mining 
      industry has dropped from 3329 to 89, approximately a 37-fold decrease.</li>
      <li>In 1912, an estimated 18,000-21,000 workers died in the United States 
      from work-related injuries. In 1913, the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
      documented approximately 23,000 industrial deaths among a workforce of 38 
      million, for a rate of 60.5 deaths per 100,000 workers. National Safety 
      Council data from 1933 through 1997 indicate that work-related death rate 
      declined 90%, from 37 per 100,000 workers in 1933 to 4 per 100,000 in 
      1997. The corresponding annual number of deaths decreased from 14,500 to 
      5100. During this same period, the workforce more than tripled, from 39 
      million to approximately 130 million.</li>
      <li>Data compiled from CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety 
      and Health (NIOSH), National Traumatic Occupational Fatalities (NTOF) 
      surveillance system, indicate that the annual total number of deaths 
      declined 28% from 7405 in 1980 to 5314 in 1995 (the most recent year for 
      which NTOF data are available). The average rate for occupational injury 
      deaths for all workers decreased 43% during the same time, from 7.5 to 4.3 
      per 100,000 workers.</li>
      <li>Industries with the highest average rates for fatal occupational 
      injury during 1980-1995 included mining (30.3 deaths per 100,000 workers), 
      agriculture/forestry/fishing (20.1), construction (15.2), and 
      transportation/communications/public utilities (13.4). Leading causes of 
      fatal occupational injury during the period include motor vehicle-related 
      injuries, workplace homicides, and machine-related injuries.</li>
