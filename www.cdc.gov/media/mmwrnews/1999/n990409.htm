    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->Between September 29, 1998 and April 4, 1999, 229 
    cases of febrile encephalitis (111 resulting in death) were reported to the 
    Malaysian Ministry of Health. These cases primarily occurred in adult men 
    who had close contact with pigs. Initially, Japanese encephalitis virus was 
    considered the likely cause for this outbreak, and specimens from some 
    patients were positive for infection with that virus. However, viral 
    isolates and serum samples from some of the patients, sent to CDC for 
    testing, indicated the presence of a new virus that was related, but not 
    identical, to the Hendra virus. The same virus has also caused illness among 
    11 abattoir workers (all had handled imported pigs from Malaysia) in 
    Singapore. Hendra virus was first recognized in 1994 after an outbreak 
    affecting racehorses and people in Australia; 13 horses and one person died. 
    Travelers to Malaysia should be aware of this outbreak which, thus far, has 
    involved only those closely associated with pig farms. No travel 
    restrictions are indicated at this time.</td>

    <!-- mmwr2 synopsis -->In July, 1998, 20 employees participated in a company 
    lunch, and shortly after eating, several people developed neurological and 
    gastrointestinal symptoms. Ten people visited a hospital emergency room and 
    two were hospitalized; there were no deaths. The Louisiana Department of 
    Health and Hospitals investigated and discovered that improperly stored and 
    labeled aldicarb had been mistakenly used as pepper during the preparation 
    of one of the food items. Aldicarb is used primarily by cotton farmers in 
    Louisiana to control infestation by mites, nematodes, and certain insects. 
    Because aldicarb is highly toxic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
    requires that applicators be certified. In this incident, a person who had 
    not been trained or certified in the use of aldicarb, had improperly stored 
    the aldicarb in a used black pepper container. </td>

    <!-- mmwr3 synopsis -->In Romania, health-care workers give approximately 
    120 million therapeutic injections annually. Previous studies indicate that 
    the reasons for the high-demand for such injections is a belief that pain of 
    the injection is a marker of efficacy, that injections are more effective, 
    and that injections represent advanced technology. In Romania, adults 
    preferred injected medications for treatment of conditions that generally do 
    not require injections; fever, respiratory tract infections, vitamin 
    supplements, and diarrhea. Therapeutic injections have been associated with 
    the transmission of hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, and other bloodborne 
    pathogens. Programs to improve injection safety should focus on reducing the 
    number of therapeutic injections which increase the likelihood of improper 
    use of injection equipment.</td>

    <h2><font face="Arial Narrow,Arial" size="5">Hendra Virus</font></h2>
    <p align="right"><strong>April 9, 1999</strong><br>
     CDC, Division of Media Relations<br>
     (404) 639-3286 </p>
    <p><font>Hendra virus was first recognized in 1994 after an outbreak 
     affecting racehorses and humans occurred in Queensland, Australia. </font>
     Infection appear to have been acquired from intimate contact with infected 
     horses via probable exposure to blood or other body fluids or excretions.<font></font></p>
    <p><font></font>Hendra virus can infect more than one species of animal. 
     Scientists believe fruit bats (also known as flying foxes) are the natural 
     'host' of the virus. This means the virus is carried by fruit bats, but has 
     little effect on them. However, when it is transmitted to humans, horses, 
     and other animals its effect can be lethal. Experimental studies have shown 
     that in horses and cats the virus can cause fatal pneumonia.</p>
    <p>Animals infected with Hendra excrete the virus in their urine.<font></font></p>
    <p>CDC has developed a serological test for Hendra IgM. The virus has been 
     classified as a genus with the <em>Paramyxovirinae</em> family and is being 
     studied at Biosafety Level-4 (&quot;Hot Zone&quot;).</p>
    <p><strong><em>Hendra-like illness in Malaysia and Singapore</em></strong><em></em><br>
     This first cluster of cases began in Malaysia in late September 1998. Thus 
     far, the majority of case-patients have been men working on pig farms.</p>
    <p>Hendra virus in swine is not well defined but appears to begin with 
     respiratory symptoms that include rapid and forced respiration and an 
     explosive non-productive cough, poor appetite, and decreased movements. In 
     some cases, the animal may become restless, develop muscle tremors, and 
     exhibit aggressive behavior such as biting the bars of the pen.</p>
    <p>Specific routes of transmission have yet to be determined but close 
     contact with pigs appears to be necessary for human infection.<font></font></p>
    <p><font>Studies are underway to determine the risk of human-to-human 
     transmission and to define specific risk factors associated with infection.</font></p>
    <p><font>Persons anticipating travel to Malaysia should follow CDC regional 
     recommendations for Southeast Asia. The recommendations are on-line at
