    free of polio, including the entire Western hemisphere (Region of the 
    Americas) since 1991; the Western Pacific Region since 1997; and in the 
    European Region, transmission is now confined to a single country (Turkey). 
    To achieve the polio eradication target by the end of the year 2000, a major 
    acceleration of activities is now underway, which includes India, the 
    world's largest polio-endemic country, and Democratic Republic of Congo.

    pregnancy has declined among women who gave birth to a live-born infant in 
    Maine. A significant decrease was observed for women older than 20 years of 
    age, and no decrease was observed for the younger women. Smoking prevalence 
    for women younger than 20 years of age in 1997 was 37.9% (37.4% in 1988). 
    For those older than 20, prevalence was 18.7% in 1997 (30.0% in 1988). 
    Smoking prevalence among women participating in the Special Supplemental 
    Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) shows a decline, 
    but the overall smoking prevalence for this population remains high. Maine's 
    Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring System will continue to monitor 
    smoking prevalence among pregnant women who give birth to a live-born

    Vol. 48/May 28, 1999/RR-6
    <p>February 1999, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
     expanded recommendations for varicella (chickenpox) vaccine to promote 
     wider use of the vaccine for susceptible children and adults. The updated 
     recommendations include establishing child care and school entry 
     requirements, use of the vaccine following exposure and for outbreak 
     control, use of the vaccine for some children infected with the human 
     immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and vaccination of adults and adolescents at 
     high risk for exposure. These recommendations also provide new information 
     on varicella vaccine postlicensure safety data. </td>

      <li>Smoking during pregnancy is known to be associated with adverse 
      outcomes such as low birth weight, intrauterine growth retardation, and 
      pre-term deliveries.</li>
      <li>Between 20 to 30 percent of the incidence of low birth weight is 
      attributable to maternal cigarette smoking.</li>
      <li>U.S. birth certificate data show that in 1997, 13.2% of women giving 
      birth reported to have smoked cigarettes. The smoking rate among 
      non-Hispanic women 18-19 years old was the highest, approximately 29.6%.</li>
      <li>From 1990 to 1997, U.S. birth certificate data on cigarette smoking 
      during pregnancy show that smoking rates declined for women above 20 years 
      of age.</li>
      <li>In 1997, U.S. birth certificate data on cigarette smoking during 
      pregnancy among young women 15-19 years of age show a rate of 17.6%.</li>
      <li>Data from Maine BRFSS show a decline in smoking rates among women 
      between 18-44 years of age from 1988 to 1997. Smoking prevalence was 34% 
      in 1988 and it was 24% in 1997, showing a decline of approximately 29%.</li>
      <li>PRAMS data from Maine show a decline in smoking during the last three 
      months of pregnancy among women giving birth to a live-born infant from 
      1988 to 1997. Smoking prevalence in this population was 30.7% in 1988 and
