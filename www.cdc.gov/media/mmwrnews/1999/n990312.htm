    last decade. Black infants are nearly twice as likely to be preterm as white 
    infants. Recent increases in the rate of multiple births are believed to 
    contribute to increasing rates of preterm birth. When singleton births were 
    examined using U.S. certificates of live birth, rates overall were stable 
    between 1989 and 1996. However, preterm births increased by 8% among white 
    non-Hispanic women and decreased 10% among black non-Hispanic women. These 
    findings are independent of changes in maternal demographics, time of entry 
    into prenatal care, and induction practices. The risk of singleton preterm 
    birth among black women is still almost twice that of white women.</td>

    Notable declines were shown for both Salmonella and Campylobacter, and for 
    the parasitic foodborne disease, Cyclospora. The decline in cases of 
    Cyclospora follows restrictions on the import of raspberries into the United 
    States after a large outbreak of the disease was traced to the fruit. 
    However, cases of E. coli O157:H7 increased during this same period. The 
    reasons for the increase in E. coli infection is unclear. In 1998, the

    <p><font>The Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) is the 
     primary foodborne diseases component of CDC's Emerging Infections Program (EIP). 
     FoodNet is a collaborative project conducted in conjunction with the United 
     States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug 
     Administration. FoodNet began in 1996.</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The 7 EIP sites are located in California, Connecticut, Georgia, 
      Maryland, Minnesota, New York, and Oregon. The total population of these 
      sites is 20.5 million (7.7% U.S. population).
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>FoodNet conducts active surveillance for infections caused by 7 
      bacterial and 2 parasitic organisms: (bacterial) <i>Campylobacter, 
      Escherichia coli </i>O157:H7, <i>Listeria, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio,
      </i>and <i>Yersinia</i>; (parasitic) <i>Cryptosporidium</i> and <i>
      Cyclospora</i>. One of the primary objectives of FoodNet is to determine 
      the frequency and severity of <b>laboratory confirmed</b> foodborne 
      diseases.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Each year, millions of people become sick with foodborne illnesses; 
      however, only a fraction seek medical care and an even smaller number 
      submit laboratory specimens.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>From 1996 to 1998, the incidence of <i>Salmonella</i> infections 
      declined 14%. <i>Campylobacter</i> infection rates initially climbed, but 
      then fell by 8% from the 1996 baseline. Rates of <i>E. coli </i>O157 
      infections declined in 1997, but by the end of 1998 had risen to a level 
      slightly above the 1996 rates.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>1998 summary findings from FoodNet for bacterial foodborne illnesses:
      <ul>
        <li><i>Campylobacter</i> was reported more often than any other pathogen 
        from all sites (19.7/100,000 population) with rates from 10.2/100,000 in 
        Maryland to 37.7/100,000 in California. </li>
        <li>Rates of infection with <i>Salmonella</i> were similar , but rates 
        for specific <i>Salmonella</i> serotypes varied among the sites. </li>
        <li><i>Shigellosis</i> rates varied from 16.0/100,000 in Georgia to 
        2.2/100,000 in Connecticut. </li>
        <li><i>E. coli</i> O157 infection rates ranged from 4.5/100,000 in 
        Minnesota to 1.1/100,000 in Maryland. </li>
        <li><i>Yersinia</i> infection rates varied from 1.6/100,000 in Georgia 
        and California to 0.4/100,000 in New York. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>1998 summary findings from FoodNet for parasitic foodborne illnesses:
      <ul>
        <li>Illness caused by <i>Cryptosporidium</i> dropped 7%. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Some of the changes in rates of foodborne illnesses may reflect 
      changes in meat and poultry processing as mandated by the USDA's &quot;Pathogen 
      Reduction and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point Systems&quot; rule. 
      The program was implemented in January 1998 in the largest plants.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The increased rates of <i>Vibrio</i> infections reflect several 
      multistate outbreaks of V. <i>parahaemolyticus</i> infections in 1997 and 
      1998. However, the reasons for the increase in <i>E. coli</i> O157 
      infections is unclear.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Additional EIP sites will be added to the program; Tennessee is 
      scheduled to begin collecting data in 1999. </li>
