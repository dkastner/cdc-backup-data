     century, five vaccines had been developed; in this century, 21 diseases 
     have been added to the list of those that are preventable by vaccine.</font></p>
    <p><font>At the end of the century, polio caused by wild virus has been 
     eradicated from the Western Hemisphere; childhood vaccination levels in the 
     United States are at an all-time high; and disease and death from 
     diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and <em>Haemophilus

    <p><font>In 1900, 21,064 cases of smallpox were reported in the United 
     States.; 894 of these persons died. The last case of smallpox in the United 
     States was reported in 1949. The last case in the world was reported in 
     1977. The eradication of smallpox made it possible to stop efforts at 
     prevention and treatment, including, in 1971, routine vaccination. One 
     report, published in 1985, estimated that the U.S. recoups its investment 
     in worldwide eradication of smallpox every 26 days.</font></p>
    <p><font>In the 1920's, other diseases that are now vaccine-preventable

     20,000 annually.</font></p>
    <p><font>To fulfill the promise of vaccines in the future, the current 
     vaccination delivery system must be strengthened, extended to new 
     populations of adolescents and adults, and international efforts to deliver 
     existing and new vaccines must be enhanced.</font></p>

    <p align="right"><strong>April 2, 1999</strong><br>
     CDC, Division of Media Relations<br>
     (404) 639-3286 </p>
    <p><font>Malaria is caused by one of four protozoan species of the genus <em>
     Plasmodium: P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale</em>, and <em>P. malariae</em> 
     and is transmitted by the bite of an infected female <em>Anopheles</em> 
     mosquito. Occasionally transmission occurs by blood transfusion or 
     congenitally from mother to fetus.</font></p>
    <p><font>Malaria is transmitted in large areas of Central and South America, 
     Hispaniola, sub-Saharan Africa, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, 
     Southeast Asia, and Oceania. Worldwide it is estimated that 300-500 million 
     clinical cases and 1.5-2.7 million deaths occur due to malaria annually.</font></p>
    <p><font>Although the disease was eradicated in the United States in the 
     1940s, about 1,000-1,400 cases of malaria are reported to CDC each year; 
     almost all acquired during international travel. Over 75% of these cases 
     are associated with failure to use recommended chemoprophylaxis.</font></p>
    <p><font>Each year in the United States, several cases (&lt; 10) of malaria are 
     acquired stateside, by congenital transmission, local mosquito-borne 
     transmission, or by blood transfusion or organ transplantation. On average, 
     2-3 cases of transmission occur by blood transfusion annually.</font></p>
    <p><font>Symptoms of malaria include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, 
     and malaise. Early stages of malaria may resemble the onset of the flu. 
     Travelers who become ill with a fever during or after travel in a malarious 
     area should seek prompt medical attention and should inform their physician 
     of their recent travel history.</font></p>
    <p><font>Malaria can often be prevented by the use of antimalarial drugs and 
     the use of personal protection measures against mosquito bites. <em>
     Anopheles </em>mosquitoes bite during nighttime hours, from dusk to dawn. 
     The risk of malaria depends on the traveler's itinerary, the duration of 
     travel, and the place where the traveler will spend evenings and nights.</font></p>
    <p><font>Travelers can still get malaria, despite use of prevention 
     measures. Malaria symptoms can develop as soon as 6-8 days after being 
     bitten by an infected mosquito, or as late as several months after 
     departure from a malarious area (after antimalarial drugs are 
     discontinued). Malaria can be treated effectively in its early stages, but 
     delaying treatment can have serious consequences. Malaria can cause anemia 
     and jaundice, and can lead to coma, renal failure, acute respiratory 
     distress, and death.</font></p>
