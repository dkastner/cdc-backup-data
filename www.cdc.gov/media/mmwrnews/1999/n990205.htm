    of <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>. People usually become infected through 
    contact, ingestion, or inhalation of the spores, which are extremely durable 
    and can be delivered as an aerosol. The public health response to 
    bioterrorism threats requires communication and coordination with public 
    health partners including first responders (police, fire, emergency medical 
    services, and hazardous materials units) and law enforcement officials. CDC 
    is actively working with state and local health departments, federal 
    agencies, and nongovernmental organizations to address the growing threat of 
    bioterrorism. This report summarizes the findings of these investigations 
    and provides <em>interim</em> guidelines for public health authorities on 
    bioterorrism threats. All of the anthrax threats reported in this article 
    were hoaxes.</td>

    1997, adults in seven states and Puerto Rico (total: 20,847) responded to a 
    telephone survey about CVD and physician counseling. The results showed that 
    physicians are more likely to advise patients with a history of CVD to 
    improve their diet and increase physical activity. However, whether or not 
    they have heart disease, respondents indicated that they were more likely to 
    practice such behaviors, if their physician recommended it. These findings 
    suggest that physicians could help patients reduce their risk of 
    cardiovascular disease, if they routinely counseled all of their patients to 
    reduce fat and cholesterol intake and increase their physical activity. </td>

    people infected with both HIV and TB have a 100 times greater risk of 
    developing active TB disease, which can then spread to others. During these 
    outbreaks, 32 cases of TB were confirmed among HIV-infected inmates and 
    parolees, and a visitor. These findings point to the rapid cycle of TB 
    transmission in the prison environment. Early diagnosis, isolation of 
    infectious TB cases, and effective treatment among HIV-infected inmates is 
    needed to cure TB disease and to minimize outbreaks. Following these 
    investigations, new procedures were developed by the California departments 
    of corrections and health services to ensure that suspected TB cases are 
    tracked, and contacts are identified rapidly to prevent future outbreaks.</td>

    </center>
    <p>In observance of National Child Passenger Safety Week, February 14-20, 
     CDC has published recommendations stating that children more than 4 years 
     of age and weighing over 40 lbs., who have outgrown their child safety 
     seats, require belt positioning booster seats used with vehicle 
     lap/shoulder belts to ride safely. Most children under the age of 10 years 
     are not big enough to ride safely without the use of a booster seat. A 
     partnership between CDC, other federal agencies, and private organizations 
     focused recommendations on this age group because currently 75% of these 
     children are not properly restrained in motor vehicles, and another 20% 
     ride unrestrained entirely. The consequences can be deadly. In 1997, nearly 
     half of the 5-9-year-old children, who were passengers involved in fatal 
     crashes, were unrestrained. </p>

    <p><strong>What is a Booster Seat?<font size="-1"></strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Belt-positioning booster seats are designed to raise 
     children up on the car seat so that the lap/shoulder belts fit correctly. 
     This is the preferred type of booster seat and requires a lap/shoulder belt 
     in the back seat of the vehicle. Shield booster seats have a plastic shield 
     in front of the child. These seats offer less protection, however, and the 
     report recommends they only be used with the shields removed so that they 
     function as belt-positioning booster seats.</font></p>
    <p><strong>Why Use a Booster Seat?<font size="-1"></strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">In the United States, 1,791 children younger than 15 
     years were killed and 282,000 were injured as passengers in motor vehicle 
     crashes in 1997. Among 5-9 year old passengers, 46% of those involved in 
     fatal crashes were unrestrained.</font></p>
    <p><strong>Who Should Use a Booster Seat?</strong><font size="-1"></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">Children should start using a booster seat when they grow 
     out of their convertible child safety seats -- when their ears are level 
     with the top of the back of the safety seat and their shoulders are above 
     the top strap slots, or when they reach the upper weight limit for the 
     seat. Children should use a booster seat until the lap/shoulder belts in 
     the car fit properly -- when they are at least 58 inches tall, have a 
     sitting height of 29 inches and weigh 80 pounds (with clothing on). To ride 
     comfortably and safely, children must be able to bend their knees over the 
     edge of the seat while sitting with their backs firmly against the seat 
     back. In most cases, this means that children 10 years old and younger 
     should be using a booster seat.</font></p>
    <p><strong>Where Should Booster Seats be Placed in the Car?<font size="-1"></strong></font></p>
    <p><font size="-1">All children 12 years and younger should ride in the back 
     seat whenever possible, regardless of whether they use a booster seat.</font></p>
