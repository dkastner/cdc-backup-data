      At least 157 babies born at one community hospital received the antibiotic erythromycin after
      they had been possibly exposed to pertussis (whooping cough). Over the next month, seven of
      these babies developed pyloric stenosis, a disorder in which a muscle at the bottom of the
      stomach enlarges causing obstruction of the outlet of the stomach; milk or other food cannot
      pass from the stomach to the small intestine. As a result, infants with pyloric stenosis have
      projectile vomiting and are treated surgically. The rate of pyloric stenosis in infants who
      received the antibiotic erythromycin was unusually high. All seven of these babies were less
      than 3 weeks old when they began taking erythromycin. It is important to prevent whooping
      cough in very young infants because it can lead to death; however, physicians should carefully
      evaluate the risks and benefits of erythromycin in newborns less than a month old.</td>

      Iowa public health officials investigated three sequential outbreaks of carbon monoxide (CO)
      poisoning during a 6-month period, resulting from exhaust emissions from LP gas-powered
      forklifts operated in enclosed industrial settings. A combination of poorly tuned forklifts
      coupled with inadequate ventilation exacerbated subsequent exposures to persons working in
      these facilities. Recognition of CO poisoning was delayed. Diagnosis and treatment was
      inadequate and inappropriate when patients entered the health care system. The investigation
      clearly shows that businesses need to improve forklift maintenance and install monitoring
      equipment. Likewise the medical community needs to improve efforts to screen patients for
      suspect CO poisoning and refer affected patients to hyperbaric oxygen centers.

      With approximately 30 million cases and 1 million deaths attributed to measles in 1998, this
      disease remains one of the most important cause of illness and death — despite the
      widespread availability of an effective and safe vaccine. Failure to deliver at least one dose
      of measles vaccine to all infants remains the primary reason for this preventable illness and
      death burden. During 1997-1998, routine one-dose measles vaccination coverage has declined in
      some regions. Improving routine vaccination coverage to at least 90% in each country, and
      conducting supplementary vaccination campaigns in high-risk areas are key strategies to reduce
      deaths from measles. In countries or regions where measles is under control and elimination is
      targeted, achieving over 95% coverage in nationwide supplemental vaccination campaigns is
      important.

      Pyloric stenosis is a disorder in which a muscle at the bottom of the stomach is enlarged,
      obstructing the outlet of the stomach so that milk or other food cannot pass from the stomach
      to the small intestine.
      <ul>
        <li>Infants with pyloric stenosis usually have projectile vomiting that begins at about 3 to
          4 weeks of age.
        <li>Pyloric stenosis usually affects about 1 to 3 newborns per 1000 live born babies (0.1%
          to 0.3%)
        <li>Pyloric stenosis is much more common in boys than girls.
        <li>Surgical treatment of pyloric stenosis is safe and effective.
        <li>Approximately 90% of babies born in one hospital in February 1999 received the
          antibiotic erythromycin to prevent whooping cough following a whooping cough outbreak
          among newborns born at that hospital. The rate of pyloric stenosis among babies born at
          this hospital in February 1999 was nearly seven times higher than among babies born there
          during the previous 2 years.
        <li>Approximately 5% of the newborns in this investigation who received the antibiotic
          erythromycin for whooping cough prevention developed pyloric stenosis.
        <li>The seven babies in this investigation who took erythromycin and got pyloric stenosis
          were less than 3 weeks old when they began taking erythromycin.
        <li>All seven babies in this investigation who had pyloric stenosis were surgically treated
          and have recovered.
        <li>Gastrointestinal symptoms occur frequently in babies taking erythromycin. Among the
          newborns in this investigation who received erythromycin following the pertussis outbreak,
          over 20% had symptoms of excessive fussiness, and over 30% reported vomiting.
        <li>Oral erythromycin is the recommended treatment for newborns with whooping cough or
          chlamydia infections, and is used to prevent whooping cough in newborns who are exposed to
          persons with whooping cough. However, it is important to only give preventive treatment to
          newborns who have been exposed to a person with whooping cough symptoms.
        <li>The reported incidence of whooping cough in babies less than one year old is 50 per
          100,000.
        <li>72% of the babies less than six months old with whooping cough are hospitalized, and the
          case-fatality of whooping cough in this age group is 0.5%.
