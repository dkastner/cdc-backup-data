    investigated an incident in which a crew of 34 farm workers became ill after 
    entering a field that had been sprayed with a pesticide solution containing 
    carbofuran. The workers had not been warned that the fields had been treated 
    and that re-entry to a carbofuran-treated field should not be allowed until 
    at least 48 hours after application. The incident shows that posted and oral 
    warnings on re-entry restrictions are a critical health protection measure 
    and that failure to adhere to these restrictions can result in illness among 
    exposed workers. Because restricted re-entry intervals may be inadequately 
    protective, substitution of safer alternatives to toxic chemicals should be 
    considered and adopted where feasible.</td>

    colorectal cancer and should be screened at recommended intervals. In 1997, 
    only 41% of adults 50 and older reported having had one of the two commonly 
    recommended screening tests (fecal-occult blood test or flexible 
    sigmoidoscopy) within the recommended time frame. Those with higher incomes, 
    more education and health insurance were more likely to have received 
    screening tests. CDC, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the 
    National Cancer Institute encourage men and women 50 and older to talk to 
    their doctors about their screening test options, a message that is being 
    reinforced by a national media campaign.</td>

    <!-- mmwr3 synopsis -->In 1988, the World Health Assembly adopted the goal 
    of global eradication of polio to be achieved by the year 2000. Substantial 
    progress toward this goal has been reported from virtually every 
    polio-endemic country in the world. Recent laboratory and surveillance data 
    suggest that after 4 years of eradication efforts in Pakistan, previous 
    widespread poliovirus transmission has been reduced greatly, with sustained 
    transmission limited to focal geographic areas. Polio cases in Pakistan were 
    reduced by 74% from 1997 to 1998, due to highly successful supplemental 
    immunization campaigns (i.e. National Immunization Days) and rapidly 
    improving surveillance. Pakistan needs to further intensify polio 
    eradication efforts, focusing on improving routine vaccination coverage, 
    implementing additional rounds of supplemental immunization, and further 
    strengthening surveillance to reach the eradication target by the year 2000.</td>

      <li>Cancer of the colon or rectum, also called colorectal cancer, is the 
      second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in both men and women in the 
      United States.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>In 1999, an estimated 129,400 people will be diagnosed with colorectal 
      cancer and 56,600 will die of the disease.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Screening tests can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 
      identifying polyps, tiny growths inside the colon, before they become 
      cancerous. Screening also detects early cancers when treatment is most 
      effective and survival rates are high.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The 1997 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System revealed that only 
      41% of men and women aged 50 and older had one of the two most commonly 
      recommended screening tests--fecal occult blood test or flexible 
      sigmoidoscopy-- within the recommended time frame.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Many private health plans provide coverage for these screening tests, 
      and in 1998, Medicare coverage was expanded to include colorectal cancer 
      screening.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The risk of colorectal cancer increases with age. The majority of 
      cases--93 percent-- occur in men and women 50 and older.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>All racial and ethnic groups are at risk for colorectal cancer. 
      African Americans are more likely to be diagnosed when the disease is at a 
      more advanced stage and are more likely to die of it once diagnosed.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>A family history of colorectal cancer or colorectal polyps increases 
      the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
      <p>&nbsp; </li>
      <li>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health Care 
      Financing Administration and the National Cancer Institute recommend all 
      men and women 50 and older consult their doctors about the best screening 
      test options for them. </li>
