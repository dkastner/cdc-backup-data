    <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->Since the mid 1960s, rates of motor vehicle deaths 
    have fallen largely due to the production of safer vehicles and construction 
    of safer highways, as well as safer driving behaviors. These changes were 
    implemented by legislation, regulation, and law enforcement. Since the early 
    1980s alcohol-related deaths have decreased by nearly 40% and the use of 
    safety belts have risen more than five-fold. Despite these successes, 
    however, motor vehicle crashes remain the leading cause of death among 
    Americans 5 to 24 years old. In the coming century, sustaining the motor 
    vehicle safety record will require intensified efforts to use proven 
    strategies and public health surveillance systems to identify problems and 
    monitor effectiveness.</td>

    widely, while influenza A (H1N1) viruses were infrequently reported. In Hong

     CDC has established multistate surveillance and research activities to 
     evaluate the possible public health risks of <em>Pp </em>known as possible 
     estuary associated syndrome (PEAS). Cases are included in the surveillance 
     system as having PEAS if they meet the following three criteria: 1) 
     Developed symptoms within 2 weeks after exposure to coastal waters; 2) 
     Reported certain cognitive or flu-like symptoms of a certain duration; and 
     3) A health-care provider cannot identify another cause for the symptoms. 
     It has not been possible to establish an association between PEAS and <em>
     Pp</em> with certainty because a <em>Pp</em> toxin has not been identified. 
     CDC encourages increased research into toxin identification and other 
     environmental factors that influence <em>Pp</em>. </td>

    <ul>
      <li>Chickenpox is caused by Varicella zoster virus and is usually mild, 
      but it may be severe in infants, adults and persons with impaired immune 
      systems. Almost everyone gets chickenpox by adulthood (more than 95% of 
      Americans). Chickenpox is highly contagious. The virus spreads from person 
      to person by direct contact, or through the air.</li>
      <li>Approximately 90% of persons in a household who have not had 
      chickenpox will get it if exposed to an infected family member. The 
      greatest number of cases of chickenpox occur in the late winter and 
      spring.</li>
      <li>Chickenpox has a characteristic itchy rash, which then forms blisters 
      that dry and become scabs in 4-5 days. The rash may be the first sign of 
      illness, sometimes along with fever and fatigue which is usually more 
      severe in adults. An infected person may have anywhere from a few lesions 
      to more than 500 lesions on their body during an attack (average 300-400).</li>
      <li>Chickenpox is contagious 1-2 days before the rash appears and until 
      all blisters have formed scabs. Chickenpox develops within 10-21 days 
      after contact with an infected person.</li>
      <li>Adults are more likely to have a more serious case of chickenpox with 
      a higher rate of complications and death.</li>
      <li>Prior to the availability of chickenpox vaccine in the United States 
      (March 1995), CDC estimated that approximately 4 million cases occurred 
      each year which resulted in about 10,000 hospitalizations and 100 deaths 
      from chickenpox.</li>
      <li>Varicella vaccine is approved for use in healthy children 12 months of 
      age or older, and susceptible (i.e., no evidence of having had chickenpox 
      in the past) teens and adults. Varicella vaccine is highly effective in 
      protecting against severe chickenpox. Cases of disease due to the wild 
      virus, that may occur in a small proportion of vaccinees, are typically 
      very mild with fewer than 50 skin lesions and no fever.</li>
      <li>The vaccine is also approved for those at high-risk for exposure 
      including teachers, daycare center employees, military personnel, 
      residents and staff in institutional settings, non-pregnant women of 
      child-bearing age, and men living in households with young children. 
      Chickenpox vaccine is also recommended for use in susceptible persons who 
      have been exposed to a case of chickenpox.</li>
      <li>For more information about chickenpox and other vaccine-preventable 
      diseases, contact CDC's National Immunization Hotline at 1-800-232-2522 (<em>Englis</em>h) 
      or 1-800-232-0233 (<em>Espanol</em>).</li>
