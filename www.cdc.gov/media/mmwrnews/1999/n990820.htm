    deaths annually. During March 1999, six people died from carbon monoxide 
    poisoning in the state of Georgia while camping. These deaths occurred in 
    two separate incidents, due to a propane camping stove in one and a charcoal 
    grill in the other. These devices had been brought inside a tent to provide 
    warmth while sleeping. To avoid hazardous carbon monoxide exposures, camping 
    stoves, camping heaters, lanterns, and charcoal grills should never be used 
    inside a tent, camper, or other enclosed shelter. Rather, people should 
    always ensure that they have adequate bedding and clothing to provide warmth

    had been treated with cephalosporin and cephalosporin resistance may have

    excrement. In Arizona over the last 5 years, 6 persons with gastrointestinal

    patients with gastrointestinal disease that doesn't respond to the usual 
    treatment, or when a patient is diagnosed with an unusual, non-cancerous 
    abdominal tumor. Based on case reports, following surgical excision of the 
    affected areas, the patients responded to treatment with itraconazole. The

    a prevalent problem among Alaska Native children. This investigation 
    indicated that the estimated prevalence of anemia among children, 12 to 71 
    months old , in Hooper Bay, Alaska was more than twice the U.S. average. The 
    study also confirmed that the anemia was strongly related to iron 
    deficiency. Factors that were significantly associated with anemia in these 
    children included lower intake of foods that enhance iron absorption such as 
    citrus juices, and seropositivity for <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection 
    which was also highly prevalent among these children. <em>H. pylori</em> 
    infection is a bacterial infection shown to be associated with stomach 
    inflammation and ulcers in people worldwide. The extent to which <em>H. 
    pylori</em> infection may contribute to anemia in other populations requires 
    further investigation. </td>

    Basidiobolomycosis</font></h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Basidiobolomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract is a new or emerging 
      infection that may have been previously unrecognized. Cases of 
      gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis are often misdiagnosed as cancer and 
      inflammatory bowel disease. </li>
      <li>Basidiobolomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract is very rare in 
      people. Only 6 cases have been described in the world's medical 
      literature. Those cases were reported from Brazil (3), Kuwait (1), and the 
      United States (2). Half of the case-patients died despite medical therapy.
      </li>
      <li>Basidiobolomycosis of the gastrointestinal tract usually begins with 
      pain, and sometimes a mass can be felt in the abdomen. Treatment is not 
      standardized, but should include itraconazole or ketoconazole possibly 
      with surgical removal of the mass. </li>
      <li>A more common form of basidiobolomycosis causes chronic, subcutaneous, 
      fungal infection that usually affects people and some animals (such as 
      horses and dogs). The name of the specific fungus is Basidiobolus ranarum.
      </li>
      <li>The fungus is found mainly in the soil and on decaying vegetation. It 
      has also been isolated from the river banks of tropical rivers in West 
      Africa, and has also been found in association with some insects. The 
      fungus is known to be present in the gastrointestinal tracts of reptiles, 
      amphibians, and some bat species. </li>
      <li>Subcutaneous disease is found most commonly among adolescent males in 
      East and West Africa and Southeast Asia. The mechanism of transmission is 
      thought to be traumatic inoculation. </li>
      <li>The disease usually starts as a painless nodule or &quot;lump&quot; underneath 
      the skin on the trunk or limbs. The nodule grows slowly and can become 
      large and disfiguring. Sometimes the nodules can block the lymphatic 
      drainage from the limb causing swelling or elephantiasis. </li>
      <li>Several medicines have been successfully used to treat 
      basidiobolomycosis; these include: itraconazole, ketoconazole, 
      co-trimoxazole, and potassium chloride. All of these medications are given 
      by mouth, but they require many months of treatment. Treatment usually 
      continues for at least 1 month after the lesions disappear. </li>
