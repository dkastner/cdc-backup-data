        firearms decreasing

      increased. The possibility that youth and teens at risk seek these readily

      suicide method, occurring nearly twice as often as firearms, which had
      been the most frequently-used method prior to 1997, according to one of

      involvement in physical fights in the past year, according to one of several
      suicide-related studies released in the Centers for Disease Control and
      Prevention (CDC) MMWR today. While suicide is commonly associated with
      internalizing problems such as anxiety, depression, and social withdrawal,
      CDC researchers believe there is a link between violent behaviors directed
      at oneself and violent behaviors directed at others. Efforts to prevent
      youth interpersonal violence might also reduce risk for suicidal behavior.
      Additional research is needed to understand the factors that influence

      1, 1994 and June 30, 1999, the majority had no history of criminal charges,
      fighting with peers or disobedient behavior. Future suicide prevention
      strategies should include school-based efforts to identify and assist not
      only the students who have been aggressive or disruptive in the past, but
      also those who are showing signs of depression, describing suicidal thoughts,

      according to one of several suicide-related studies released in the Centers
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) MMWR today. The majority of these
      28 suicide victims had no history of criminal charges, fighting with peers
      or disobedient behavior, though eight intentionally injured someone else
      immediately before their suicide. CDC researchers believe that there is
      an important overlap between risk for interpersonal violence and risk for
      suicide. Future suicide prevention strategies should include school-based
      efforts to identify and assist not only the students who have been aggressive
      or disruptive in the past, but also those who are showing signs of depression,

      studies released in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

      devastating and challenging public health problems in that country, according
      to one of several suicide-related studies released in the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) MMWR today. More than 287,000 Chinese were
      victims of suicide between 1995 and 1999. Suicides and suicide attempts
      were most common among young Chinese women between the ages of 15 and 34.
      To address this and other challenges, including the lack of strong cultural
      prohibitions against suicide, China is seeking to understand and target
      the unique nature of suicide among its residents through research and prevention
      efforts. Currently Chinese leaders are working with CDC experts to develop
      a national suicide prevention plan as recommended by the World Health Organization
      and the United Nations.</p>
