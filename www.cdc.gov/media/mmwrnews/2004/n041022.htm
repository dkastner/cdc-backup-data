      <em><strong>The prevalence of adult Americans&#8217; frequent mental distress increased
      over the period 1993-2001 and differed substantially by race/ethnic group,
      sex, and household income&#8212;suggesting the need for improved access
      to mental health services, and educational programs that reduce stigma
      and encourage seeking treatment to reverse this trend and eliminate these
      disparities. </strong></em></p>
    <p> 
      <!-- mmwr1 synopsis -->
      The purpose of this study was to examine population differences and factors
        contributing to poor mental health in a representative sample of more
      than 1 million U.S. adults from all 50 states during 1993-2001. Frequent
      Mental
        Distress, or FMD, was defined as 14 or more days in the past 30 days
      for which mental health (including stress, depression, or emotional problems)
        was not good. Between 1993 and 2001, the prevalence of FMD increased
      from
        8.4 percent to 10.1 percent, mostly due to increases in the black and
      white non-Hispanic groups. FMD was most common among American Indians/Alaska
        Natives (14.4 percent) and other, non-Hispanics (12.9 percent), and least
        common among Asians/Pacific Islanders (6.2 percent). Respondents who
      were
        younger, female, separated, divorced, widowed, unemployed, or unable
      to work or who had less than a $15,000 annual household income, high school
        education, or no health insurance reported more FMD. Targeting socioeconomic
        risk factors, improving access to mental health services and social services
        (e.g., job training programs), and implementing educational programs
      that
        reduce stigma and encourage seeking mental health treatment could decrease
        FMD for U.S. adults. </p>

    <p>Roughly 20 percent of MSM with syphilis indicated only oral sex exposure,
      and MSM were 3.8 and 3.4 times more likely than heterosexual men and women,
      respectively, to report only oral sex. Of all the MSM with syphilis, 51
      percent were already HIV-positive, 34 percent were unaware of their status,
      and 14 percent were HIV-negative. While the risk of transmitting HIV through
      oral sex is much lower than through anal or vaginal sex, oral sex is a
      an efficient way of transmitting syphilis. Many people falsely believe
      that unprotected oral sex is a safe behavior and fail to use condoms during
      oral sex. Authors stress the importance of alerting people to the risk
      of syphilis transmission through oral sex, the role of syphilis in facilitating
      HIV transmission, and its possible role in HIV disease progression.</p>

    <p>In March 2004, an Iowa student while returning from India developed measles.
      He was unvaccinated, and was known to be exposed to other students with
      measles while in India. The public health effort used to prevent further
      spread of this disease, included isolation and quarantine. Recent changes
      in Iowa&#8217;s state law, because of concerns for bioterrorism and emerging
      diseases, allowed the state health department to use these tools to stop
      measles transmission. These tools, not normally used, were considered necessary
      since the student was a member of a particularly vulnerable community.
      As a result of using post exposure prophylaxis, isolation, and both voluntary
      and involuntary quarantine, only two additional people became ill. </p>

    <!-- mmwr5 synopsis -->
    <p>The number of recreational waterborne illness outbreaks reported in 2001-2002
      is the largest number of outbreaks recorded since data collection began
      in 1978. Over 2,500 people were affected in 65 outbreaks. Almost half (46.2%)
      were outbreaks of diarrheal illness, with Cryptosporidium accounting for
      half of outbreaks associated with disinfected swimming venues, likely due
      to its chlorine resistance. An increase in the number of skin infections
      associated with swimming over the period 1997 to 2002 was also documented.
      Although many of these recreational water illnesses were preventable, the
      increasing trend in reporting of recreational water-associated outbreaks
      underscores continuing problems with poor pool and spa maintenance, watershed
      contamination, and people ill with diarrhea who continue to swim despite
      their illness.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Fewer drinking water outbreaks occurred during 2001-02 than
          during the previous reporting period, and is near the lowest numbers
          since reporting began. Drinking water regulations enacted by EPA are
          likely to be largely responsible for this decrease, and continued development
      of such regulations (including the pending Groundwater Rule) is warranted. </em></strong></p>

    <p>Provision of safe drinking water to the American public remains a priority.
      This summary of disease outbreaks related to drinking water during 2001-2002
      demonstrates a decrease in the number of such outbreaks compared to the
      previous two-year period. Over the past 20 years, the number of outbreaks
      has declined dramatically. Because the steepest decrease has been of outbreaks
      associated with the types of water systems (&#8220;community&#8221; systems)
      governed most directly by EPA drinking water regulations, this decline
      is likely due in large part to these increasingly stringent regulations.
      Water systems using groundwater sources are associated with the largest
      proportion of outbreaks; this argues for the continued development of EPA&#8217;s
      Groundwater Rule, which calls for better regulation of groundwater systems.
      Individually operated groundwater systems (e.g., private wells, etc.) continue
      to account for a large proportion of outbreaks. Because these systems are
      not subject to regulation by EPA, there is a continued need for education
      of builders, owners and users of such wells.</p>
