                              <p>CDC's influenza activity  report, FluView, shows continued increases in flu activity in the United  States. According to CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden, &quot;Today&rsquo;s&nbsp;report  confirms that the U.S. flu season is off to an early start though it's too  early to tell how severe our season might be.&nbsp;However, we know that  thousands die and hundreds of thousands of people are hospitalized with flu  each year. Vaccination is the single most important step we can take to  protect ourselves and our families against infection.&nbsp; It's not too late  to get vaccinated.&rdquo; </p>

                  <p>Significant increases in flu activity in the United States have occurred in the   last two weeks, indicating that an early flu season is upon us. These increases   in activity overlap with National Influenza Vaccination Week (NIVW) being   observed December 2-8, 2012. According to Dr. Melinda Wharton, Acting Director   of CDC&rsquo;s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, &ldquo;Increasing   flu activity should be a wake-up call. For anyone who has put off vaccination:   It&rsquo;s time to get your flu vaccine now.&rdquo;</p>

                  <p>National Hand Washing Awareness Week is December 2nd  –December 8th.  Keeping hands clean through improved hand  hygiene is one of the most important steps we can take to avoid getting sick  and spreading germs to others. Many diseases and conditions are spread by not  washing hands with soap and clean, running water. If clean, running water is  not accessible, as is common in many parts of the world, use soap and available  water. If soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer  that contains at least 60% alcohol to clean hands. </p>

                  <p>Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of  dementia among older adults, affects parts of the brain that control thinking,  remembering and making decisions. It can seriously impair a person's ability to  complete daily activities. Learn more about Alzheimer's disease and factors  that may increase or lessen your risk for getting the disease. It is estimated  that as many as 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. Younger people may  get Alzheimer's disease, but it is much less common than in older adults. The  disease usually begins after age 60 and risk goes up with age. About 5 percent  of men and women ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's disease. It is estimated that  nearly half of those age 85 and older may have the disease.</p>

                  <p>During November 12-18, 2012, the annual Get Smart About Antibiotics Week will be observed. Overuse of antibiotics promotes antibiotic resistance and compromises their effectiveness. Infections caused by resistant bacteria have become more common, and many bacteria have become resistant to multiple antibiotics. As in past years, the observance will coordinate work of CDC’s Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work and Get Smart for Healthcare programs, state-based initiatives, non-profit partners, and for-profit partners during a one week observance of antibiotic resistance and the importance of appropriate antibiotic use. Messages and resources for improving antibiotic use are available. </p>

World Rabies  Day is an excellent time to take steps that can help prevent and control  rabies, such as vaccinating pets including dogs and cats and providing  education on how to avoid the animals that typically transmit rabies: raccoons,  bats, skunks, and foxes. </p>

                  <p>Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affects an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Americans. Due to the serious health problems associated with SCD there is a need to know more about the disease. People with SCD can live full lives and enjoy most of the activities that other people do. If you have SCD, it’s important to learn how to stay as health as possible.</p>

                  <p>Ovarian cancer causes more deaths than any other  cancer of the female reproductive system. But when ovarian cancer is found in  its early stages, treatment is most effective. Ovarian cancer often causes  signs and symptoms, so it is important to pay attention to your body and know  what is normal for you. Symptoms may be caused by something other than cancer,  but the only way to know is to see your doctor, nurse, or other health care  professional. </p>

                  <p>As parents and kids get ready to head back to school, it&rsquo;s a  great time to update your child&rsquo;s vaccine records. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to be  aware of your child&rsquo;s environment and how it might be affecting their health.  &nbsp;&nbsp;The environment affects  children differently than adults. Because their bodies are still growing,  children are at greater risk if they are exposed to environmental contaminants.  Contaminants are anything that can cause something to become unclean, polluted,  or not pure. They can be found anywhere and some are unsafe.&nbsp; Check out  the new <a href="http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/showChildEHMain.action">Children&rsquo;s Environmental Health</a> module on CDC&rsquo;s Environmental Public  Health Tracking Network to learn more about information related to children&rsquo;s  health and the environment.  You will  find information on asthma, childhood cancers, lead poisoning, developmental  disabilities and more.</p>

                  <p>About 67 million adults have high blood  pressure.  More than half (36 million)  have uncontrolled high blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk  factor for heart disease and stroke, the first and fourth leading causes of  death in the United States, leading to nearly 1,000 deaths a day. The majority  of people with high blood pressure are being treated with medicine, yet their  condition is still not under control. Millions more are either aware they have  high blood pressure but aren&rsquo;t getting any treatment with medicine or don&rsquo;t  know they have high blood pressure.<strong> </strong>The September issue of CDC&rsquo;s Vital  Signs highlights the importance of awareness and treatment for adults with  uncontrolled hypertension.&nbsp; Adults with high blood pressure can gain  control by taking their blood pressure medicine  </p>

                  <p>A report on   the discovery of a new human pathogen, named &ldquo;Heartland virus&rdquo;, was published   this week in the New England Journal of Medicine.  In the paper, authors from   the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Heartland Regional   Medical Center describe the two known cases of illness   caused by this novel virus, which occurred in 2009.  Both   patients had tick bites in the days leading up to their illness, and were   hospitalized with multiple symptoms, including fever, headache, fatigue and   diarrhea. Both patients recovered from their illness.  </p>
                              <p>Much is yet to   be learned about Heartland virus. CDC is working with the Missouri Department of   Health and Senior Services, local health departments, and several healthcare   facilities in Missouri to determine symptoms and potential severity of the   disease, the geographic extent of the disease, how people are infected and ways   to prevent infections.</p>

                              <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics&rsquo; journal <em>Pediatrics</em> has released a CDC study   describing influenza-related deaths in children during the 2009 H1N1 influenza   pandemic. The study focused on deaths in children with neurologic disorders   because they represented a large percentage of the pediatric deaths. Of 343   pediatric deaths reported to CDC that were associated with the 2009 H1N1   pandemic, 336 had information on the children&rsquo;s underlying medical conditions.   Of these, 68 percent of pediatric deaths   reported to CDC were in children who had at least one underlying medical   condition that put them at high risk for   influenza-related complications. An estimated 64 percent of children with a high risk   condition had an underlying neurologic disorder. Neurologic disorders were the   most frequently reported underlying medical conditions in this study.<br />

This awareness month highlights the need  for improving national immunization coverage levels and encourages all people  to protect their health by being immunized against infectious diseases. While  CDC does not sponsor this month, CDC does support and encourage the efforts of  state and local health departments and other immunization partners to celebrate  NIAM and use this month to promote back to school immunizations, remind college  students to catch up immunizations before they move into dormitories, and  remind everyone that the influenza season is only a few months away. It&rsquo;s a  great reminder to our nation that people of all ages require timely  immunization to protect their health. <br />

                              <p>Today, CDC reported a total of 153 cases of human infection with influenza A (H3N2) variant virus (or “H3N2v virus”) associated with outbreaks detected beginning in July. The H3N2v viruses are the same as previous H3N2v viruses identified in people in 2011 and April 2012 and H3N2 viruses found in U.S. swine in 2011 and 2012. Influenza viruses can spread from contact between infected pigs and people and from infected people and pigs. To reduce this risk, preventive measures such as practicing frequent hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette are recommended.</p>
<p>H3N2v is not a food-borne illness. <u>Influenza viruses have not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating pork (pig meat)</u>,  For more information about the proper handling and preparation of pork, visit the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/factsheets/Pork_From_Farm_to_Table/index.asp">USDA website fact sheet Fresh Pork from Farm to Table.</a></p>
<p>According to a report published in the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm61e0810a1.htm?s_cid=mm61e0810a1_e">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)</a>, more than 90 percent of H3N2v cases were in children younger than 18, with the median age being 7 years. All of the cases reported exposure to pigs, the majority at agricultural fairs where pigs were present.  Two confirmed hospitalizations have been reported and both patients have recovered and been discharged.  No deaths have been reported.  Symptoms so far have been mostly mild. </p>
<p>Late summer is typically fair season across the United States, and fairs are a setting that can provide many opportunities for exposures to occur between pigs and people. CDC continues to monitor the situation closely and recommends preventive actions to make people’s fair experience a safe and healthy one. </p>

Genetic testing at CDC has confirmed  that viruses found in humans and those found in swine in this situation are nearly identical. Fairs are an important event for exhibitors and their swine, and a great experience for fairgoers, but the detection of H3N2v at a few fairs last year, and the re-emergence at one fair so far this year is an issue CDC is watching. &quot;As fair season begins across the United States, CDC would like to let people know about some preventive actions they can take to make their fair experience a safe and healthy one,&quot; says CDC Influenza Division Deputy Director Dan Jernigan. </p>

                              <p>Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can become chronic,  life-long infections that can lead to liver cancer. Millions of Americans live  with chronic viral hepatitis, and many do not know they are infected. Although Saturday,  July 28th is World Hepatitis Day, viral hepatitis needs more  attention throughout the year. Data from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) shows  the American public and health care professionals lack knowledge and awareness  about viral hepatitis. The term &lsquo;hepatitis&rsquo; means inflammation of the liver,  and it refers to a group of diseases, each caused by a unique virus.</p>

                              <p>Breastfeeding helps protect children from obesity. In the US, most mothers want – and try – to breastfeed. Unfortunately, even moms who want to breastfeed have a hard time without hospital support.CDC data shows 96%  of hospitals lack maternity care policies and practices that fully support moms to be able to breastfeed. Hospitals can do more to make sure every mother can start and continue breastfeeding. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative recommends 10 Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. Find out how better maternity care practices can help mothers start and continue breastfeeding.</p>

                              <p>The  risk of injury and death from home fires is real. Consider that: In 2011, fire  departments across the country responded to 384,000 home fires. These fires  claimed the lives of 2,640 people and injured another 13,350. Approximately 4  out of 10 home fire deaths occur in homes without smoke alarms. The main reason  smoke alarms fail to operate during home fires is missing or disconnected  batteries. Your  home should be a safe and comfortable place—and you can help keep it fire-safe  by following simple steps. </p>

                              <p>Getting too hot can make you sick. You can become ill from the heat if your body can't compensate for it and properly cool you off. Heat exposure can even kill you: it caused 3,442 deaths in the United States from 1999 to 2003, and average 688 deaths a year.  
                                These are the main things affecting your body's ability to cool itself during extremely hot weather: high humidity and personal factors. </p>

                              <p>Arthritis affects 50  million Americans and is expected to increase significantly as the population  ages. Each year in May, Arthritis Awareness Month focuses national attention on  the burden of arthritis and the tools and resources for better managing arthritis  symptoms. Take action—don't let  arthritis limit you. Being overweight is one of the strongest risk factors for  osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis. Routine and physical  activity is recommended for people with arthritis. There are many things that  you can do to live well with arthritis. Maintaining a healthy weight and being  physically active are just two of them. </p>

                              <p><em>Asthma </em>is one  of the most common lifelong chronic diseases. There are about 25 million  Americans living with asthma. The disease affects the lungs, causing repeated  episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Although  asthma cannot be cured, it is possible to manage asthma successfully to reduce  and prevent asthma attacks, also called episodes. Successful asthma management  includes knowing the warning signs of an attack, avoiding things that may  trigger an attack, and following the advice of your healthcare provider. Using  what you know about managing your asthma can give you control over this chronic  disease. When you control your asthma, you will breathe better, be as active as  you would like, sleep well, stay out of the hospital, and be free from coughing  and wheezing. </p>

                              <p>You  go to the hospital to get well, right? Of course, but did you know that  patients can get infections in the hospital while they are being treated for  something else? There are many things you can do to be a safe patient and avoid  Healthcare Associated infections (HAI&rsquo;s). HAIs are infections patients get  while being treated for something else in a healthcare environment. HAIs are caused by a wide variety of common or unusual  bacteria, fungi, and viruses. These infections can have devastating emotional,  financial, and medical effects. Worst of all, they can be deadly. </p>

                              <p>Sexual violence (SV) is any sexual act that is  perpetrated against someone's will. SV encompasses a range of offenses,  including a completed nonconsensual sex act (i.e., rape), an attempted  nonconsensual sex act, abusive sexual contact (i.e., unwanted touching), and  non-contact sexual abuse (e.g., threatened sexual violence, exhibitionism,  verbal sexual harassment). All types involve victims who do not consent, or who  are unable to consent or refuse to allow the act. Risk factors are associated  with a greater likelihood of sexual violence (SV) perpetration. They are  contributing factors and may or may not be direct causes. Not everyone who is  identified as &quot;at risk&quot; becomes a perpetrator of violence. A  combination of individual, relational, community and societal factors  contribute to the risk of becoming a perpetrator of SV. Understanding these  multilevel factors can help identify various opportunities for prevention.</p>

                              <p>CDC received a report earlier this evening of a passenger on a plane at Midway Airport who had a rash. Since the passenger had been in Africa, a family member had reported concerns that the rash might be monkeypox. The passenger was evaluated by Chicago Emergency Medical Services. Medical staff at CDC and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) reviewed the case and, based on the patient's symptoms and photographs of the rash, it does not appear that the signs and symptoms are consistent with a monkeypox infection. The ill passenger was advised to seek medical care and the rest of the passengers were released from the plane. CDC and CDPH believe there is very little risk to other passengers. However, out of an abundance of caution, the airline will be collecting contact information for other passengers should CDC need to contact them in the future. </p>

                              <p>Malaria,  a disease spread by mosquito bites, can lead to impoverishment, disability, and  death. Beyond the loss of human potential, malaria&rsquo;s direct costs total more than $12 billion each year and cause  substantial economic losses for entire nations. Encouragingly,  inexpensive yet simple interventions can dramatically reduce malaria&rsquo;s impact.</p>
                              <p> From  global efforts to grass-roots mobilization, resources committed to fight malaria  have increased greatly in the past decade. Hundreds  of millions of life-saving insecticide-treated bed nets and effective  antimalarial medicines are now available to people who need them, especially pregnant  women and children under 5 years old, who are most vulnerable to malaria.</p>

                              <p>The United States has become increasingly diverse in the last century. According   to the 2010 U.S. Census, approximately 36 percent of the population belongs to a   racial or ethnic minority group. Though health indicators such as life   expectancy and infant mortality have improved for most Americans, some   minorities experience a disproportionate burden of preventable disease, death,   and disability compared with non-minorities. The future health of the nation   will be determined to a large extent by how effectively we work with communities   to eliminate health disparities among those populations experiencing a   disproportionate burden of disease, disability, and death. Persistent health   disparities in our country are unacceptable and correctable.

                              <p>Colorectal cancer, also called colon cancer, is cancer that occurs in the colon or rectum. Colorectal cancer affects men and women of all racial and ethnic groups, and is most often found in people aged 50 years or older. In the United States, it is the third most common cancer for men and women. Of cancers that affect both men and women, colorectal cancer is the second leading cancer killer in the United States, but it doesn't have to be. </p>

                              <p>When it comes to weight loss, there's no lack of fad  diets promising fast results. But such diets limit your nutritional intake, can  be unhealthy, and tend to fail in the long run. The key to achieving and maintaining  a healthy weight isn't about short-term dietary changes. It's about a lifestyle  that includes healthy eating, regular physical activity, and balancing the  number of calories you consume with the number of calories your body uses.  Staying in control of your weight contributes to good health now and as you  age. </p>

                              <p>As of March 2nd, 27 people in six  states have been confirmed to have measles in 2012. Most of these people (21)  were not vaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Five U.S. residents and  two foreign travelers got infected with measles in Ethiopia, France, Pakistan,  or Uganda and brought it to the U.S. Measles outbreaks (3 or more cases) have  occurred in Indiana and Kansas. Measles vaccine is highly effective at  preventing measles. People should be up-to-date on vaccinations, including  before international travel. High vaccine coverage, early detection, and rapid  public health response prevent this highly infectious disease from spreading. </p>

                              <p>While  we often consider sleep to be a &ldquo;passive&rdquo; activity, sufficient sleep is  increasingly being recognized as an essential aspect of health promotion and  chronic disease prevention in the public health community. Insufficient sleep  is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions—such as  diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression—which threaten our  nation&rsquo;s health. Notably, insufficient sleep is associated with the onset of  these diseases and also poses important implications for their management and  outcome. Fundamental  to the success of all of these efforts is the recognition that sufficient sleep  is not a luxury—it is a necessity—and should be thought of as a &ldquo;vital sign&rdquo; of  good health. </p>

                              <p>Overdose deaths from prescription painkillers—a class of drugs that includes hydrocodone, methadone, oxycodone, and oxymorphone—have skyrocketed in the past decade.

Prescription painkillers are widely misused and abused. One in 20 people in the United States, ages 12 and older, used prescription painkillers nonmedically (without a prescription or just for the "high" they cause) in 2010.  </p>

The most common heart disease in the United States is  coronary heart disease, which often appears as a heart attack. Some heart attacks are  sudden and intense; however, most heart attacks start slowly, with mild pain or  discomfort. The chance of developing coronary heart disease can  be reduced by taking steps to prevent and control factors that put people at  greater risk. </p>

After careful consideration of all available evidence, CDC guidance   on the use of antiviral medications remains unchanged. The <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/flu/professionals/antivirals/index.htm">Centers for   Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) continues to recommend the use of the   neuraminidase inhibitor antiviral drugs</a> (oral oseltamivir and inhaled   zanamivir) as an important adjunct in the prevention and treatment of   influenza.</p>

                              <p> The One &amp; Only Campaign is a public health campaign, led by the CDC and the Safe Injection Practices Coalition, to raise awareness among patients and healthcare providers about safe injection practices. Since 1999, more than 125,000 patients in the United States have been notified of potential exposure to hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and HIV due to unsafe injection practices. The goal of the One &amp; Only Campaign is to ensure that every injection administered to patients is safe. The Campaign aims to empower patients to ask questions and re-educate healthcare providers regarding safe injection practices.</p>

If women take 400 mcg of folic acid daily, before and  during pregnancy, they can help prevent them. In the U.S. 3,000 pregnancies are  affected by neural tube defects (NTDs) every year. NTDs are serious birth  defects of the spine and brain; two of the most common NTDs are spina bifida  and anencephaly. Taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily can help  prevent these major birth defects. Folic acid is a B vitamin that the body uses  to make new cells. Everyone needs folic acid. If a woman has enough folic acid  in her body before she is pregnant, it can help prevent anencephaly and spina  bifida. <br/>

                              <p>Most  cases of cervical cancer are easily preventable with regular screening tests  and follow-up. It also is highly curable when found and treated early. Now  vaccines are available to protect against the most common cause of cervical  cancer. All women are at risk for cervical cancer. It occurs most often in  women over age 30. Cervical cancer is highly preventable because screening  tests (such as the Pap test) and vaccines to prevent HPV infections are  available. When cervical cancer is found early, it is highly treatable and  associated with long survival and good quality of life. The main cause of  cervical cancer is human papillomavirus (HPV), a common virus that can be  passed from one person to another during sex. HPV also causes other cancers,  including vaginal, vulvar, anal, penile, and some head and neck cancers. At  least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their  lives. <br/>

                              <p>January  is National Birth Defects Prevention Month. Birth defects affect approximately  one in 33 newborns and are a leading cause of infant mortality in the United  States. This year, National Birth Defects Prevention Month focuses on  medication use before, during, and after pregnancy. This includes  over-the-counter or prescription medications and herbal or dietary products.  Approximately two thirds of women use at least one medication during their  pregnancy. Because of the possible risks to the unborn baby, pregnant women are  not included in the testing of new medications. As a result, little information  is available about the safety of taking most medications during pregnancy.  Better data will allow women and their health-care providers to make informed  decisions about treatment during pregnancy and evaluate the risks and benefits  of treatment. CDC's National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) helps  identify medications that can increase the risk for birth defects. NBDPS data  have been used to understand the risks associated with specific  antidepressants, antibiotics, and antihypertensives.<br/>
