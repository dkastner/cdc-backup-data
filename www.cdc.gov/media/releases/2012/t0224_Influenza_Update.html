       <p>OPERATOR:  Welcome, Thank you all for standing by, at this time, all participants are on  listen-only mode, during the questions   and answer session, you may press star 1 to ask a question. Today’s  conference is being recorded. At this time, I will return the call over to Glen  Nowak. </p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK: Well, thank you, and thank you all for calling in this afternoon for  this CDC Update on influenza and where we stand in the current influenza  season. This telebriefing is going to be handled by Dr. Joseph Bresee. His last  name is B-R-E-S-E-E. He's an M.D. and Chief of our Epidemiology Prevention  Branch at the CDC’s Influenza Division. He'll start with opening remarks and  then we'll turn it over to questions and answers. So I will now turn it over to  Dr. Bresee.</p>
<p>JOSEPH  BRESEE: Good Afternoon, everybody. I'm going to start with a couple of summary  statements about what we are seeing in the season so far. Then I’m going to  questions and answers and have answers to any question you have.  So today's CDC published a summary of  influenza activity in the U.S. It brings us up to date so far in the season and  also the information in the report covers the season through February 11. In  addition, this week's Flu View on the website reports an update on influenza  activity for the week of February 12 to 18, 2012. So, I want to take a few  minutes to describe what we have seen so far this season.</p>
<p>First  and most important, the flu season has officially begun. This week's flu review  reports that the national percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive  for influenza rose to 14.4 percent from 13.4 percent the prior week. This is  the third consecutive week this season that the percent of respiratory specimen  testing positive for flu has surpassed 10 percent which is generally a marker  to indicate the flu season has begun. By this measure, activity this season is  off to a very late start. In fact, this is the latest start to the flu season  in 29 years. Based on CDC flu surveillance data the percentage of respiratory  samples testing positive for flu has remained below the 10 percent mark until  February only once before. This occurred during the 1987-88 season. Despite  activity remaining low in the U.S from early October through January, influenza  viruses have been reported from all 50 states. Influenza A, H3N2 viruses, 2009  Influenza A H1N1 viruses and Influenza B viruses have all been identified this  season in the U.S.</p>
<p>So  far influenza A H3N2 viruses have predominated, accounting for more than 70  percent of viruses that have been typed. The majority of influenza viruses  characterized so far this season are well matched to the strains in the  2011-2012 influenza vaccine. Although, slightly fewer than 50 percent of the  flu B viruses tested this season have been similar to the Influenza B component  in the 11-12 influenza vaccine. Very few B viruses have circulated in the U.S.  so far this season.  Testing of U.S. viruses  this year show all are susceptible to the antiviral drugs Oseltamivir and  Zanamivir and these data reinforce the value of antiviral medications,  especially for those with serious illness and those at higher risk for serious  illness due to influenza because of underlying health condition. Unfortunately,  because influenza activity has been relatively low so far this season, levels  of severe influenza have also been low. Hospitalization rates for patients with  laboratory confirmed influenza remain low. Pneumonia and influenza-related  mortality based on our 122 cities mortality reporting system hasn't exceeded  the epidemic threshold for more than a week and continues to remain low and  three influenza pediatric deaths have been reported this far this season  compared with 122 such deaths reported last season. In fact, since 2004 when  pediatric deaths associated with influenza infection became a nationally  notifiable condition the number of deaths reported to the CDC each year has  ranged from 46 in the 2005-06 season to 282 deaths in the 2009-10 season. In  fact, 340 influenza associated deaths among children were reported to the CDC  during the 2009 H1 pandemic. </p>
<p>While  most indicators of seasonal flu activity are currently low we expect them to  increase in the coming weeks. For instance, visits to doctors for  influenza-like illness nationally remain below baseline this week,  but two of the ten  U.S. regions representing mid-western states  reported ILI activity above region specific baselines and increased from one  last week. Also, two states report widespread influenza activity this week and  increased from one from last week. Regional influenza activity was reported in  13 states and increased from 12 last week. And 20 states reported local  influenza activity and increased from 17 last week. Only the U.S. Virgin  Islands and Guam reported no influenza activity this week. This information and  a lot of other information is available on the CDC’s Flu View and the past  issues are archived for you to see on the CDC website. </p>
<p>To  summarize, the United States is experiencing a late start to influenza season  this year, but activity has increased in the past few weeks. This pattern is  unusual but not unprecedented. Although, we could attempt to speculate as to  the possible reasons for the late start, we can only be certain that flu is inherently  unpredictable. In addition to flu season starting late, they can also reach  peak activity late. In fact, in the past 35 seasons we have seen peak activity  as measured by the month with the highest percentage of respiratory specimens  that test positive for flu four times in March and two times in April. So we  can't predict the timing of peak activity in the United States nor when the  season will end, nor can we predict how severe the season will ultimately be. So  if you haven't gotten the flu vaccine yet or your loved ones haven't gotten  theirs yet, get your vaccine now. It's not too late. Flu vaccine remains the  best way to protect yourself from getting the flu. You will need this season's  vaccine to protect against this season's influenza.</p>
<p>JOSEPH BRESEE: As you know CDC recommends everyone 6  months of age and older get the annual flu vaccine. Before I finish let me  update you on one little bit of data that just came in over the last couple of  days. As you, know yesterday the World Health Organization (WHO) announced its  recommendations for three vaccine viruses to be included in the trivalent  northern hemisphere flu vaccine for next season, 2012-13 season. The  recommendations for both H3N2 component and the B component of the vaccine have  been updated this year.  WHO's  recommendations to update two of the three strains for next seasons vaccine was  based on data collected on influenza viruses circulating in countries around  the world, but remember the current 2011-12 vaccine remains a good match to  influenza viruses circulating in the United States at this time. Finally, as an  option for vaccine manufacturers that would like to create a quadrivalent  vaccine or a four component vaccine that would protect against four different viruses,  WHO has also recommended a second B strain. Production of a quadrivalent vaccine  has been under consideration for some time mostly because there are two very  different lineages of B viruses called the Yamagata and  Victoria. Selecting the B virus component for the vaccine has been challenging  because the circulation of these two lineage viruses have been unpredictable  and they often Co-circulate. At the end of this month the vaccine viruses in  the U.S. will be chosen at the FDA’s VERPAC meeting in Washington, D. C.  An optional fourth vaccine component doesn't  necessarily mean a four component vaccine will be available immediately,  however. Finally, implementation will depend on manufacturers and this could  take some time. It does however; signal that we are moving in the direction of  a quadrivalent influenza vaccine. That's all I have. I'm happy to take  questions from anybody who has them. </p>
<p>OPERATOR:  At this time we are ready to begin the  question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press  star one. You will be prompted to record your name. To withdraw your request  you may press star two. Again press star one to ask a question and one moment  for our first question. Our first question come from Daniel DeNoon with WebMD,  you may ask your question. </p>
<p>DANIEL  DENOON: Thanks for taking my question. Do you have figures on the up take of  flu vaccine this year and is there any sense that the larger numbers of flu  vaccinations have had any effect on the number of infections this year?</p>
<p>JOSEPH BRESEE: Great question, Daniel, thank you so much  for the question. We do have some information. So far what we know is 132  Million doses of vaccine have been distributed in the United States. While we  don't know the total coverage at this point in time we do know that as of  November or so there were more people vaccinated by November this year, then  where vaccinated by November of last year. But the second part of the question  is actually quite interesting. I do think, in fact, that as vaccine coverage  increases we ought to see less disease in the United States. So I think  although this season has been mild and the onset has been late and that can’t  be attributed solely to vaccine practices I do think increasing vaccine  coverage in the United States will certainly and probably is certainly playing  a role in less transmission and less disease this year.</p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK:  Operator, next question.</p>
<p>OPERATOR:  Our next question comes from Donald McNeil with the New York Times. You may ask  your question.</p>
<p>DONALD  MCNEIL: Hi, Joseph. Can you talk a little about why this season is so odd? Why  the H3N2 predominating and so little H1N1? Is that a result of people having  been exposed to the pandemic H1N1 earlier? And can you talk a little bit about  what's going on in the rest of the world and how it may affect the United  States? I have noticed the B virus seems overwhelming in China and parts of  Southeast Asia which seems unusual. </p>
<p>JOSEPH BRESEE: Don, thanks for those questions, they are  good questions. I wish I knew the right answer to both of them. Let me give you  a shot. First, the reason this season is late and mild and we see H3N2  predominating is probably related to a bunch of different factors. Some of  which we know and some of which we don't know. First what we know is the timing  of influenza and how severe it is each year and which viruses circulate are  highly variable and hard to predict. But there are three things that are  interesting. One is the fact that the virus is circulating this year are quite  similar to the viruses that circulated last year. So it's possible that in the  population there are higher levels of immunity to these viruses compared to  last year and that may mean less transmission and less disease. Second what we  know and as I said the vaccine coverage rates continue to trend upward. That  should lead to less transmission over time and less severe disease over time,  especially if high risk people continue to get vaccinated in higher numbers.  Those things I know. And are probably related, probably aren't the sole  explanation for what we are seeing this year.  I think there are probably high levels of  antibodies in the population against pandemic H1N1 because of the high levels  of disease in 2009 and 2010. That probably play as role in the amount of H1  disease we are seeing this year. </p>
<p>Finally,  I have been asked about the weather. Does the weather play a role and the  weather might. There's been intense research on weather and how it relates to  respiratory virus spread. We do know that in cold, less humid times influenza  viruses remain more viable for longer.   We know that in cold weather people tend to cluster inside more and  maybe facilitate transmission. We know those things, how those things impact  this season and what total impact they have on flu circulation overall I don't  know. But I think they might play a role here as well. So I think in the U.S.  we are seeing a pattern. We have seen it before occasionally, but it's not very  common. Probably related to a bunch of factors, some of which we can speculate  on and some of which we can't. I do think that globally it gets even more  complicated. In China and northern Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, we are seeing lots  of B’s right now. In fact in Laos we are seeing lots of H1’s as well, and in  Mexico we are seeing more H1’s than in the U.S.   The specific patterns of influenza virus circulation around the World, I  find difficult to predict. Luckily they are smart people in the world that can  predict it well enough to make a good vaccine each year. But I'm not sure I can  add much more to that. Thanks.</p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK: Operator next question. </p>
<p>OPERATOR:  The next question is from Mitchell Zoler with Internal Medicine News. </p>
<p>MITCHELL  ZOLER: I wanted you to put the 132 million doses of seasonal vaccine distributed  in some kind of better context. I know that outside of a pandemic the CDC isn't  really responsible for the distribution. How does that compare to perhaps any kind  of goal or sense you have of what would be adequate levels of immunization in  the country?</p>
<p>JOSEPH  BRESEE: It's a great question. I will clarify one thing. As you know, the doses  distributed don't mean doses given. CDC measures two things. Early in the  season we measure how many doses have been sent out to folks. We don't know how  many have been given necessarily. So we do surveys to measure how many actually  were given to a human. Therefore estimates what the uptake is in different populations.  I think the 132 million doses distributed so far this season is about on par  with what we have seen the last few years. Slightly under what was distributed  all of last season but we're not quite finished yet. I don't know what will  happen by the end of the season. I think coverage rates in key populations like  pregnant women and children have been trending upwards steadily- slowly but  steadily over the last couple of years. That's gratifying.</p>
<p>I  think that our goals for influenza vaccine coverage are much higher than they are  now in most groups. We'd like to get to 80 percent coverage in high risk groups  for instance. We are not near there in any group. More people need to get flu vaccine  than currently do. We think by doing that we can decrease both the transmission  of influenza and therefore protect people who didn't get their vaccine this year  but more importantly protect those people who did get the vaccine.</p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK: Next question. </p>
<p>OPERATOR:  The next question is from Theresa Juva with the Journal News. You may ask your  question. </p>
<p>THERESA  JUVA: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Why is it that some regions are showing  more activity than others? There are widespread cases in Colorado and California  and other places it's still sporadic. Why is that? Is there historical pattern  to where you see cases?</p>
<p>JOSEPH  BRESEE: That's a good question. There is not a historical pattern at least  within the United States borders. Globally clearly there are patterns where the  northern hemisphere sees disease mostly in the winter time and the southern  hemisphere in the summer time. Within the United States each year where flu  shows up first, where it occurs next and where it finishes is pretty variable and  entirely hard to predict. That's why each season- because we can't predict well  where it will show up first and where it will go next- we recommend that everybody  get the vaccine before influenza activity starts in the U.S. anywhere. So we  make sure folks are vaccinated well ahead of the season. Thanks.</p>
<p>OPERATOR:  Again, if you have a question press star one. Our next question is from Michael  Smith with MedPage Today. You may ask your question.</p>
<p>MICHAEL  SMITH: Thank you, Dr. Bresee. A small technical question. I thought I heard you  say that the proportion of ILI that was actually positive for flu was 13.4 in  the week ending February 11 and 14.4 this week or the most recent week. I'm  curious because MMWR says 15 percent for the week ending February 11. </p>
<p>JOSEPH  BRESEE: You have a good eye. I will check on the numbers after the call. What  happens sometimes is we continue to update the numbers from past weeks with  this week's data. So we get some late reports from labs and we'll continue to  update. What you will see is in past weeks in the Flu View reports that some of  the numbers will change over time. Not dramatically usually, but slightly.</p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK: Next question.</p>
<p>OPERATOR:  At this time I show no further questions. If you would like to ask a question  press star one at this time.</p>
<p>GLEN  NOWAK: All right. If there are no further questions we will end this press briefing.  We'll post the transcript as soon as we can. Probably sometime later this afternoon.  If people still have questions related to seasonal flu the best way to get them  answered is to call the CDC press number which is 404-639-3286. Thank you. </p>
<p>OPERATOR:  Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. At this time you may  disconnect your line.</p>
