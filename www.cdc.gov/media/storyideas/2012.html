                                          <p>Folic acid is a B vitamin that is used by the  body to make new cells. Everyone needs folic acid! If a woman has enough folic  acid in her body <em><strong>before and during pregnancy</strong></em>, it can help prevent  major birth defects of the baby&rsquo;s brain and spine.&nbsp;CDC urges women to take  400 mcg of folic acid every day, starting at  least one month before getting pregnant, to  help prevent major birth defects. There are two easy ways to be sure to get  enough folic acid each day:</p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li >Take a vitamin that has folic acid in it every day. <br />
                                              Most multivitamins sold in the United States have the amount of folic acid       women need each day. Women can also choose to take a small pill (supplement) that has only folic acid in it each day. Multivitamins and       folic acid pills can be found at most local pharmacy, grocery, or discount stores. Check the label to be sure it contains 100% of the daily value       (DV) of folic acid, which is 400 micrograms (mcg). </li>
                                      <li>Eat a bowl of breakfast <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/cereals.html">cereal that has 100% of the daily value of folic       acid</a> every day. <br />
                                              Not every cereal has this amount. Check the label on the side of the box, and look for one that has &ldquo;100%&rdquo; next to folic acid.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>Glaucoma is a  group of diseases that can damage the eye's optic nerve and result in vision  loss and blindness. Glaucoma occurs when the normal fluid pressure inside the  eyes slowly rises. However, recent findings now show that glaucoma can occur  with normal eye pressure. With early detection and timely treatment, you can often  protect your eyes against serious vision loss. <strong>Your eyes are an important  part of your health</strong><strong>.</strong> You can do many things to keep them healthy and make  sure you&rsquo;re seeing your best. Please share the following simple guidelines with  your readers for maintaining healthy eyes well into their golden years: </p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li><strong>Have a comprehensive dilated eye exam.</strong> You might think your vision is fine or that your eyes are  healthy, but visiting your eye care professional for a comprehensive dilated  eye exam is the only way to really be sure. Regular eye exams are important for  good eye health as well as overall health. A <a href="http://www.nei.nih.gov/healthyeyes/eyeexam.asp" target="_blank" style="display:inline;">comprehensive  dilated eye exam</a> is a painless procedure in which an eye care  professional examines the eyes to look for <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/basic_information/eye_disorders.htm">common  vision problems and eye diseases</a>, many of which have no early warning  signs. <strong> </strong></li>
                                      <li>Â <strong>Know your family&rsquo;s eye health history. </strong>Talk to  your family members about their eye health history. It&rsquo;s important to know if  anyone has been diagnosed with an eye disease or condition, since many are  hereditary. <strong></strong></li>
                                      <li><strong>Eat right to protect your sight. </strong>You&rsquo;ve heard that carrots are good for your eyes. But  eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetablesâparticularly dark leafy greens,  such as spinach, kale, or collard greensâis important for keeping your eyes  healthy, too. <strong></strong></li>
                                      <li><strong>Quit smoking or  never start.</strong></li>
                                      <li>Â <strong>Maintain a healthy weight.</strong> Being overweight or  obese increases your risk of developing diabetes and other systemic conditions,  which can lead to vision loss, such as diabetic eye disease or glaucoma (Diabetic  eye disease refers to various eye problems that may occur as a complication of  diabetes, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract. These  conditions can lead to vision loss and blindness). </li>
                                      <li><strong>Â Wear protective eyewear.</strong> Wear protective eyewear when playing sports or doing activities around the  home. <strong></strong></li>
                                      <li><strong>Give your eyes a rest. </strong>If you spend a lot of time at the computer or focusing on  any one thing, you sometimes forget to blink and your eyes can get fatigued.  Try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of  you for 20 seconds. This short exercise can help reduce eyestrain. <strong></strong></li>
                                      <li><strong>Practice workplace eye safety.</strong> Employers are required to provide a safe work  environment. When protective eyewear is required as a part of your job, make a  habit of wearing the appropriate type at all times, and encourage your  coworkers to do the same.<u> </u></li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>Let&rsquo;s  face it: managing your health can be complicated. Every day, we face situations that involve life-changing  decisions about our health. Research shows that today's health information is  hard to understand and use to make good decisions. But health information and services don&rsquo;t have  to be so complicated. It helps to be a savvy consumer. How can you get the most  from health information and services? </p>
                                          <p>First,  know the law. As of this year, federal government agencies must use plain  language when they communicate with the public about critical benefits and  services. If you find federal government health information that isn&rsquo;t in plain  language, you can contact that agency and ask them to make it clear. </p>
                                          <p>Second,  clear communication is part of  the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, i.e. &quot;health reform,&quot;  the most significant change to health policy in decades. Soon, health insurance  companies will be required to tell you about coverage and benefits in plain  language. You may also find &ldquo;patient navigators,&rdquo; people who can help you find  your way through the maze of healthcare.Â  </p>
                                          <p>Third, when you go to the doctor, clinic or hospital, ask  them to use plain language when they talk to you and ask for plain language  patient information. You can take a list of questions and ask for clear answers  and explanations. </p>
                                          <p>Why is health literacy important? </p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Nearly 9 out of 10 adults  have difficulty using the everyday health information that is routinely  available in our healthcare facilities, retail outlets, media and communities.</li>
                                      <li>Without clear information  and an understanding of the information's importance, people are more likely to  skip necessary medical tests, end up in the emergency room more often, and have  a harder time managing chronic diseases like diabetes or high blood pressure.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                          <p>Inform your  readers on becoming more health literate and visit the CDC website for training  resources, materials and more for your state.Â  </p>

                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back.</li>
                                      <li>Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint.</li>
                                      <li>Chest pain or discomfort.</li>
                                      <li>Pain or discomfort in arms or shoulder.</li>
                                      <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                          <p>If  you think that you or someone you know is having a heart attack, you should  call 9â1â1 immediately.</p>
                                          <p> If  the blood supply to the heart muscle is cut off, a heart attack can result.  Cells in the heart muscle do not receive enough oxygen and begin to die. The  more time that passes without treatment to restore blood flow, the greater the  damage to the heart. Having high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol,  smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke, physical inactivity, family history,  and having had a previous heart attack, stroke, or diabetes can increase a  person's chances of having a heart attack. You can also take steps to reduce  your risks for heart attack; learn the ABCS at Million Hearts.</p>
                                          <p> It  is important to recognize the signs of a heart attack and to act immediately by  calling 9â1â1. A person's chances of surviving a heart attack are increased if  emergency treatment is given to the victim as soon as possible.</p>

                                          <p> Tooth decay (cavities) is one of the most common chronic diseases of children in the United States. Untreated tooth decay causes pain and infections that may lead to problemsâsuch as with eating, speaking, playing, and learning. The good news is that tooth decay is preventable. The combination of fluorides and dental sealants has the potential to nearly eliminate tooth decay in children.</p>
                                          <p> Here are some things you can do to ensure good oral health for your child:</p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Protect your childâs teeth with fluoride.
                                              <ul>
                                          <li>Begin using a fluoride toothpaste when your child is 2 years old. If your child is younger than 6 years old, put only a pea-sized amount on their toothbrush.   Supervise your childâs tooth brushing, encouraging the child to spit out toothpaste rather than swallow it. Additional information is available online: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/publications/factsheets/brushup.htm">http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/publications/factsheets/brushup.htm</a>. </li>
                                          <li>If your drinking water is not fluoridated, talk to a dentist or physician about the best way to protect your childâs teeth.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                            </li>
                                      <li>Talk to your childâs dentist about dental sealants. They protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth from decay.</li>
                                      <li>Encourage your children to eat regular nutritious meals, avoid frequent between-meal snacking, and limit sugar-sweetened beverages. </li>
                                      <li>If you are pregnant, get prenatal care and eat a healthy diet. The diet should include folic acid to prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord and possibly cleft lip/palate. </li>

Healthy development means that children of all abilities,  including those with special health care needs, are able to grow up where their  social, emotional and educational needs are met. Having a safe and loving home  and spending time with familyâplaying, singing, reading, and talkingâare very  important. Proper nutrition, exercise, and rest also can make a big difference. </p>
                                          <h5>Here are some tips you, as a parent, can do to help your baby during this time:</h5>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Talk to your baby. She will find your voice calming.</li>
                                      <li>Answer when your baby makes sounds by repeating the sounds and adding words. This will help       him learn to use language.</li>
                                      <li>Read to your baby. This will help her develop and understand language and sounds.</li>
                                      <li>Sing to your baby and play music. This will help your baby develop a love for music and will       help his brain development.</li>
                                      <li>Praise your baby and give her lots of loving attention.</li>
                                      <li>Spend time cuddling and holding your baby. This will help him feel cared for and secure.</li>
                                      <li>Play with your baby when she&rsquo;s alert and relaxed. Watch your baby closely for signs of being       tired or fussy so that she can take a break from playing. </li>
                                      <li>Distract your baby with toys and move him to safe areas when he starts moving and touching       things that he shouldn&rsquo;t touch. </li>
                                      <li>Take care of yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally. Parenting can be hard       work! It is easier to enjoy your new baby and be a positive, loving parent when you are feeling good yourself. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>Share with your readers that March 10, 2012 is  National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day! This day serves to recognize  the special risks HIV/AIDS poses for women and girls, and to raise awareness of  the disease's increasing impact on them. In 2009, nearly a quarter of diagnoses of HIV infection  in the United States were among women and girls aged 13 years and older. Women  and girls of colorâespecially African American women and girlsâbear a  disproportionately heavy burden of HIV infection. In 2009, black women  accounted for nearly 60 percent of all new HIV infections among women with an  HIV infection rate 15 times higher than white women. Hispanic women are also  disproportionately affected with an HIV infection rate more than four times as  high as white women.Â  <strong> </strong></p>
                                          <p>The reason women of color are more severely burdened by  HIV and AIDS is not directly related to race or ethnicity, but rather to some  of the barriers faced by many in these communities across the country. The  harsh reality is that even with similar levels of individual risk behaviors as  women of other races, a range of factors place these women at greater risk for  HIV (e.g. greater prevalence of HIV within communities, lack of access to  healthcare, stigma, fear and misinformation).Â   To end this epidemic, we must confront the Social and environmental  factors that continue to place these women and girls at greater risk of  contracting HIV. </p>
                                          <p>On March 8, and in conjunction with National Women and  Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, CDC is launching a new HIV testing and awareness  campaign for African American women called <em>Take  Charge. Take the Test.</em> to help combat the particularly heavy burden of HIV  in this population. This campaign reminds African American women that they have  the power to take charge of their health, by learning their HIV status and  protecting themselves against HIV. <em>Take  Charge. Take the Test</em> will launch both nationally and in 10 metro areas  where black women are hard hit by HIV. Thisis the latest campaign of <em>Act Against  AIDS</em>, CDC&rsquo;s umbrella campaign to fight complacency about HIV nationwide.

                                          <p>Each year, we recognize World TB  Day on March 24, often with a variety of activities leading up to the official  day. This annual event commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch  announced his discovery of <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>, the bacillus that  causes tuberculosis (TB). TB is one of the world&rsquo;s deadliest diseases: One  third of the world&rsquo;s population is infected with TB, in 2010, nearly 9 million  people around the world became sick with TB, and, there were around 1.45  million TB-related deaths worldwide. TB is a leading killer of people who are  HIV infected.</p>
                                          <p> World TB Day provides an opportunity to raise awareness  about TB-related problems and solutions, and to support worldwide TB-control  efforts. &nbsp;CDC and our partners are committed to a world free of TB. In  their lifetimes, today's children should expect to see a world where no one  gets sick with TB. In their lifetimes, women and men should expect to see a  world where no one dies from TB. All of us can have different hopes, such as  for faster treatment; a quick, cheap, low-tech test that is accessible to all;  or an effective vaccine.</p>

                                          <p>April marks Alcohol  Awareness Month, a nationwide health observance intended to raise awareness of  the health and social problems that excessive alcohol consumption can cause for  individuals, their families, and their communities. Excessive drinking is a  dangerous behavior for both men and women.</p>
                                          <p>Binge drinking is  defined as consuming four or more drinks per occasion for women and five or  more drinks per occasion for men. It is a common and dangerous behavior that  contributes to more than 11,500 deaths among women in the U.S. each  yearâapproximately 32 deaths per day. In 2010, more than one out of every 10  women reported binge drinking during the past 30 days. On average, women who  binge drink said they engaged in this risky behavior at least three times per  month and they consume on average of 6 drinks on occasion.&nbsp; Binge drinking  usually leads to impairment, and women who binge drink with greater frequency  and intensity put themselves and those around them at increased risk of  experiencing alcohol-related harms, particularly if they are pregnant or may  become pregnant.&nbsp; Binge drinking increases the risk for breast cancer,  heart disease, and stroke, all of which are leading causes of death in women. </p>
                                          <p>Binge drinking and  the harms that result from it can be prevented. </p>
                                          <p>All Women Can:</p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li><strong>Avoid drinking alcohol if pregnant or planning to become pregnant. </strong>RememberâFetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders are 100% preventable. </li>
                                      <li><strong>Choose not to binge drink and help       others not to do it. </strong>Binge drinking leads to many       health and social problems for the drinkers, their families, and their       communities. If women choose to drink alcoholic beverages, they should do       so in moderation - defined       as the consumption of up to one drink per day for women and up to two       drinks per day for men, according to the <em>2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</em>.</li>
                                      <li><strong>Seek care from a health care provider for excessive drinking.</strong> The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening and       behavioral counseling for alcohol misuse by adults, including pregnant women. Screening and Brief Intervention has been shown to significantly decrease the number of drinks consumed per week and the number of binge drinking episodes. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>In the United States, 1 in 6 women and 1 in 33 men report that they  have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. April is  Sexual Assault Awareness Month and an opportune time to remind readers about  this serious public health problem.</p>
                                          <p>Sexual violence is any sexual activity where consent is not freely  given. This includes completed or attempted sex acts that are against the  victim&rsquo;s will or involve a victim who is unable to consent. It also includes  abusive sexual contact and noncontact sexual abuse (such as sexual harassment).  Child sexual abuse is also considered sexual violence. This type of violence can be committed by a current or former intimate partner, a family member, a  person in position of power or trust, a friend, an acquaintance, or a stranger.</p>
                                          <p>Sexual violence impacts health in many ways and can lead to long-term  health and emotional problems. Victims may experience chronic pain, headaches,  and sexually transmitted diseases. They are often fearful or anxious, and may  have problems trusting others. Anger and stress can lead to eating disorders,  depression, and even suicidal thoughts.</p>
                                          <p>The ultimate goal is to stop Sexual Violence before it begins. Efforts  at many levels are needed to accomplish this. Some examples include: </p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Engaging high school students in mentoring  programs or other skill-based activities that address healthy sexuality and  dating relationships. </li>
                                      <li>Helping parents identify and address violent  attitudes and behaviors in their kids. </li>
                                      <li>Creating policies at work, at school, and in  other places that address sexual harassment. </li>
                                      <li>Developing mass media (e.g., radio, TV,  magazines, newspapers) messages that promote norms, or shared beliefs, about  healthy sexual relationships. </li>
                                    </ul>
                                          <p>For more examples, see <em>Sexual Violence Prevention: Beginning the  Dialogue </em>(<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pub/SVPrevention.html">www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pub/SVPrevention.html</a>).</p>

                                          <p>National  Infant Immunization Week (NIIW) is an annual observance to promote the benefits  of immunizations and to improve the health of children two years old or  younger. NIIW is part of a broad global initiative with the World Health  Organization to promote vaccination through education and communication  activities. Since 1994, local and state health departments, national  immunization partners, health care professionals, community leaders from across  the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  have worked together through NIIW to highlight the positive impact of  vaccination on the lives of infants and children, and to call attention to  immunization achievements.</p>
                                          <p>This  year&rsquo;s NIIW, set for April 21-28, 2012, will be held in conjunction with the  Pan American Health Organization&rsquo;s (PAHO) Vaccination Week in the Americas  (VWA). Hundreds of communities across the United States and throughout the  Western Hemisphere are expected to participate in NIIW and VWA by planning  community awareness, education, and media events to promote infant and child  immunizations to parents, caregivers, and health care professionals.</p>
                                          <p>Awareness  and education events are being planned in conjunction with state and local  health departments, PAHO, and the United States-Mexico Border Health Commission  in sister cities sites along the U.S.-Mexican border. More than 40 countries  throughout the Western Hemisphere are expected to work together on VWA to  highlight the need for routine vaccinations for infants and children.<br />

<p>Asthma, a disease that affects the lungs, is one of the  most common long-term diseases of children and adults. It causes repeated  episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and night time or early  morning coughing. CDC&rsquo;s National Asthma Control Program helps Americans living  with asthma achieve better health and improved quality of life while reducing  the overall hardship that asthma creates for families, employers, schools, the  healthcare system, and communities.</p>

                                      <li><strong>Get Enough Sleep</strong>: Insufficient sleep is associated with a number of chronic diseases and conditions, such as       diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Also, insufficient sleep is responsible for motor vehicle and machinery-related       accidents, causing substantial injury and disability each year. Adults should get 7-9 hours of sleep per night, according to the National Sleep Foundation. </li>
                                      <li><strong>Be Smoke-Free</strong>: Don&rsquo;t smoke and avoid secondhand smoke. Inhaling other people's smoke causes health problems similar to those of smokers. Quitting smoking has immediate and long-term benefits. Within 20 minutes after smoking that last cigarette, your body begins a series of changes that continue for years.</li>
                                      <li><strong>Be Physically Active</strong>: Be active for at least 2Â½ hours a week. Include activities that raise your breathing and heart rates and that strengthen your muscles. You don't have to do it all at once. Spread your activity out during the week, and break it into smaller chunks of time during the day. </li>
                                      <li><strong>Eat What Counts</strong>: Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables every day. Limit foods and drinks high in calories, sugar, salt, fat, and alcohol. Choose healthy snacks. </li>
                                      <li><strong>Get Vaccinated</strong>: Some adults incorrectly assume that the vaccines they received as children will protect them for the rest of their lives. </li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>Sickle cell disease is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. In sickle cell disease, red blood cells become hard and sticky and look like a C shaped farm tool called a "sickle." The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. When they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. Sickle cell disease affects an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 Americans. </p>
                                          <p> Sickle cell disease affects people of many racial and ethnic groups. In the United States, 1 in 400 African-American newborns have the disease. Other people affected include Hispanics, people of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent, and Asians. In addition, more than 3 million people carry the gene that allows them to potentially pass the disease on to their children.</p>
                                          <p> Regular health checkups with a primary care doctor can help prevent some serious problems. Babies from birth to age 1 should see a doctor every 2 to 3 months.  Children ages 1 to 2 should see a doctor at least every 3 months. Children and adults ages 2 or older should see a doctor at least once every year. Common illnesses, like the flu, can quickly become dangerous for a child with sickle cell disease. The best defense is to take simple steps to help prevent infections. </p>
                                          <p> Try to stay healthy by drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water every day and eat healthy food. Try not to get too hot, too cold, or too tired. Children can, and should, participate in physical activity to help stay healthy. However, it's important that they don't overdo it, rest when tired, and drink plenty of water. </p>

                                          <p> Due to advances in the early detection and  treatment of cancer, people are living many years after a diagnosis. In January  2007, about 11.7 million people with a previous diagnosis of cancer were living  in the United States. Approximately 66 percent of people diagnosed with cancer  are expected to live at least five years after diagnosis. </p>
                                          <p> Cancer survivors may face physical, emotional,  social, spiritual, and financial challenges as a result of their cancer  diagnosis and treatment. Public health professionals strive to address  survivorship and quality of life issues such as the coordination of care,  patient-provider communication, health promotion, support services, and  fertility preservation. In light of these concerns, public health initiatives  aimed at understanding and preventing secondary disease, recurrence, and the  long-term effects of treatment are essential.</p>
                                          <p> Cancer survivors are at greater risk for  recurrence and for developing second cancers due to the effects of treatment, unhealthy  lifestyle behaviors, underlying genetics, or risk factors that contributed to  the first cancer. The following factors can help maintain health and improve  survival and quality of life after a cancer diagnosisâ</p>

                                          <p>More than one-third of U.S. adults (over 72 million people) and 17% of U.S.  children are obese. In Â 1980â2008,  obesity rates doubled for adults and tripled for children. During the past  several decades, obesity rates for all population groupsâregardless of age,  sex, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education level, or geographic  regionâhave increased markedly.&nbsp; Recent reports show that substantial  differences exist in obesity prevalence by race/ethnicity, and these  differences vary by sex and age. For example, according to 2005â2008 data from  the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 51% of non-Hispanic black  women aged 20 years or older were obese, compared with 43% of Mexican Americans  and 33% of whites. Among females aged 2â19 years, 24% of non-Hispanic blacks,  19% of Mexican Americans, and 14% of whites were obese. Efforts are being made  to reduce these disparities by focusing interventions on subgroups with high  prevalence of obesity.</p>

                                          <p>Do your readers know one of the most highly effective preventive measures a  mother can take to protect the health of her infant is to breastfeed?&nbsp;  However, in the United States, though most mothers hope to breastfeed and 75%  of babies start out being breastfed, only 15% are exclusively breastfed 6  months later. Additionally, rates are significantly lower for African-American  infants.</p>
                                          <p>The success rate among mothers who want to breastfeed can be greatly  improved through active support from their families, friends, communities,  clinicians, health care leaders, employers, and policymakers. Given the  importance of breastfeeding for the health and well-being of mothers and  children, it is critical that we take action across the country to support  breastfeeding.</p>
                                          <p>Let your readers know about who can help support breastfeeding: </p>
                                          <ol>
                                      <li>Mothers and their families. For example, mothers can talk to doctors and nurses about breastfeeding plans, and ask how to get help with breastfeeding.  Ask about breastfeeding support when choosing a hospital.  Join with other community members to encourage local hospitals to become</li>
                                      <li>Communities. A woman's community has many components, such as public health and other community-based programs, coalitions and organizations, schools and child care centers, businesses and industry, and the media. The extent to which each of these entities supports or discourages breastfeeding can be crucial to a success in breastfeeding.</li>
                                      <li>Health care. Nearly all births in the United States occur in hospital settings, but hospital practices and policies in maternity settings can undermine maternal and infant health by creating barriers to supporting a mother's decision to breastfeed.</li>
                                      <li>Employment. Employed women currently are less likely to initiate breastfeeding, and they tend to breastfeed for a shorter length of time than women who are not employed. Most employed mothers who are lactating must express milk at work for their children and should be provided with accommodations to do so.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                          <p>Regular physical activity in childhood  and adolescence improves strength and endurance, helps build healthy bones and  muscles, helps control weight, reduces anxiety and stress, increases  self-esteem, and may improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services recommends that young people aged 6â17  years participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily. </p>
                                          <p>Schools have an important role in  promoting physical activity among young people. Research shows that students  who earn mostly As are almost twice as likely to report regular physical  activity than students who receive mostly Ds and Fs. Schools can promote  physical activity through comprehensive school physical activity programs,  including recess, classroom-based physical activity, intramural physical  activity clubs, interscholastic sports, and physical education. Schools should  also ensure that physical education is provided to all students in all grades  and is taught by qualified teachers. Schools can also work with community  organizations to provide out-of-school-time physical activity programs and  share physical activity facilities. </p>
                                          <p>Regular physical activity can benefit  younger people by helping build and maintain healthy bones and muscles. It can help  reduce the risk of developing obesity and chronic diseases, such as diabetes,  cardiovascular disease, and colon cancer. It can reduce feelings of depression  and anxiety and promotes psychological well-being. It also may help improve  students&rsquo; academic performance.</p>
                                          <p>Remember, participation in physical  activity declines as young people age. So stay active!!! </p>

                                      <li>Regular physical activity is important for good health, and it's  especially important if you're trying to lose weight or to maintain a healthy  weight. Adults should be active for at least 2Â½ hours a week. Talk and enjoy  each other&rsquo;s company while you walk, bowl, swim, dance, play tennis, and more.<strong></strong></li>
                                    </ul>

                                          <p>High blood pressure is a leading risk factor for heart  disease and stroke, the first and fourth leading causes of death in the United  States. &nbsp;Nearly 1 in 3 U.S. adults â 67 million people â has high blood  pressure, and more than half â 36 million â don&rsquo;t have it under control.&nbsp;  High blood pressure costs the nation almost $131 billion a year in direct  health care costs.</p>
                                          <p>Adequate treatment and control of high blood pressure can  reduce the risk of heart attacks  and strokes, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease, and can save lives. <br />

More than 3,000 organizations â national, regional, and local  public and private organizations â are supporting emergency preparedness  efforts and encouraging all Americans to take action.</p>
                                          <p> September  2012 marks the ninth annual National Preparedness Month, sponsored by the U.S.  Department of Homeland Security. One goal of Homeland Security is to educate  the public about how to prepare for emergencies, including natural disasters,  mass casualties, biological and chemical threats, radiation emergencies, and  terrorist attacks.</p>

                                          The possibility of public health emergencies arising in the United  States concerns many people in the wake of recent hurricanes, tsunamis, acts of  terrorism, and the threat of pandemic influenza. Though some people feel it is  impossible to be prepared for unexpected events, the truth is that taking  preparedness actions helps people deal with disasters of all sorts much more  effectively when they do occur.

                                          <p>Rabies  is a preventable viral disease of mammals most often transmitted through the  bite of a rabid animal. The vast majority of rabies cases reported to the CDC  each year occur in wild animals like raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes.</p>
                                          <p> September 28 is World Rabies Day, a global health  observance that seeks to raise awareness about rabies and enhance prevention  and control efforts. Co-sponsored by CDC and the Alliance for Rabies Control  since 2007, World Rabies Day has been celebrated in countries throughout the  world, including the U.S.</p>
                                          <p> World Rabies Day is an  excellent time to take steps that can help prevent and control rabies, such as  vaccinating pets including dogs and cats and providing education on how to  avoid the animals that typically transmit rabies.

It is  the most common cause of death from cancer among Hispanic women, and the second  most common cause of death from cancer among white, black, Asian/Pacific  Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.</p>
                                          <p> A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast.  Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early when it is easier to  treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular  mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. Women between the  ages of 40 and 49 should talk to their doctor about when to start getting  mammograms. Women who are 50 or older should get a screening mammogram every  two years.</p>

                                          <p> Down syndrome is a common chromosomal condition affecting about 6,000 babies in the U.S. each year.  The number of babies born with Down syndrome has been increasing in recent years, in part due to the growing number of pregnancies in older women.  Because of better health care and services, people with Down syndrome are living longer and many lead productive lives well into adulthood.  However, differences in survival still exist and are not fully understood. </p>
                                          <p> Down syndrome is a condition in which a baby is born with an extra chromosome. This extra copy of genetic material changes the bodyâs and brainâs normal development and can cause mental and physical problems for the baby. Even though people with Down syndrome might have some physical and mental features in common, every baby born with Down syndrome is different and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Some examples of physical problems associated with Down syndrome include a birth defect of the heart or problems with the stomach, hearing, skeleton, intestines, thyroid, or eyes. People with Down syndrome usually have an IQ in the mild-to-moderate range of intellectual disabilities and typically have delayed language development and can have difficulties with physical coordination. </p>
                                          <p> Babies and children with Down syndrome often benefit from special therapies that help to improve their physical and intellectual limitations, including speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy. Children with Down syndrome usually also benefit from extra help or attention in school.  These services and improved care have contributed to full and productive living lasting well into adulthood for many people with Down syndrome. </p>

                                          <p>Bullying is a form of youth violence and can result in physical injury and social and emotional distress. Victimized youth are at increased risk for mental health problems, including depression and anxiety, psychosomatic complaints such as headaches, and poor school adjustment. Youth who bully others are at increased risk for substance use, academic problems, and violence later in adolescence and adulthood. </p>
                                          <p> Bullying can also occur through technology, also known as electronic aggression or cyberbullying. Electronic ag-gression is bullying that occurs through e-mail, a chat room, instant messaging, a website, text messaging, or videos or pictures posted on websites or sent through cell phones. </p>
                                          <p> The ultimate goal is to stop bullying before it starts. Research on preventing and addressing bullying is still developing. School-based bullying prevention programs are widely implemented, but have mixed evidence of effectiveness. There are some general youth violence prevention programs that seem promising for preventing bullying as well. Based on a review of the limited research on school-based bullying prevention, the following program eleÂ¬ments are promising:</p>

                                          <p> CDC works 24/7 with state and local health departments to save lives and safeguard communities from public health threats. When states are prepared to detect or respond rapidly to threats, communities are better protected. CDC plays a critical role in preparing states because of its unique expertise in responding to infectious, occupational, or environmental incidents.</p>
                                          <p>CDC suggests some the following basic steps to take to prepare for a storm, if you are under a watch or warning:</p>

                                      <li>Learn about your community's emergency plans, warning signals, evacuation routes, and locations of emergency shelters.</li>
                                      <li>Identify potential home hazards and know how to secure or protect them before the hurricane strikes. Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines, or before you evacuate. Turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate. Secure structurally unstable building materials.</li>
                                      <li>Buy a fire extinguisher and make sure your family knows where to find it and how to use it.</li>

                                          <p> CDC estimates that each year roughly one out of six Americans (or 48 million  people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne  diseases. Â Food safety is especially important as  you prepare a holiday meal. Most foodborne  outbreaks are local and many result from food being contaminated when it is  being prepared or served by unwashed or improperly washed hands. CDC is a food safety  partner with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Food Safety and  Inspection Service (FSIS), which is responsible for the safety of meat and  poultry. Scientific evidence shows that preventing  illness begins with the basics.</p>
                                          <p>Help keep your readers informed and safe during this holiday season by  sharing the following safety tips with them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

                                      <li><strong>Cook.</strong> Use a food thermometer to ensure that foods are cooked to a safe internal  temperature: 145Â°F for<strong> whole meats</strong> (allowing the meat to rest for 3  minutes before carving or consuming), 160Â°F for<strong> ground meats</strong>, and 165Â°F  for all<strong> poultry</strong>. </li>
                                      <li><strong>Chill.</strong> Keep your refrigerator below 40Â°F, and refrigerate food that will spoil. </li>

Handwashing is easy to do and it's one of the most effective ways to prevent  the spread of many types of infection and illness in all settingsâfrom your  home and workplace to child care facilities and hospitals. Washing hands can  help stop germs from spreading from one person to another and even throughout communities.</p>

                                          <p>What is the  right way to wash your hands?</p>
                                          <ul class="bulleted-links">
                                      <li>Wet your hands with clean running water (warm or cold) and apply soap.</li>
                                      <li>Rub your hands together to make a lather and scrub them well; be sure to scrub the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and       under your nails.</li>
                                      <li>Continue rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song from beginning to       end twice.</li>
                                      <li>Rinse your hands well under running water.</li>
                                      <li>Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                          <p>Washing hands with soap and water is the best way to reduce  the number of germs on them. If soap and water are not available, use an  alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Alcohol-based  hand sanitizers can quickly reduce the number of germs on hands in some  situations, but sanitizers do <strong>not</strong> eliminate all types of germs.</p>

                                      Holiday Tips</h3>
                                          <p>The holidays are a time to celebrate, give thanks, and reflect. They are also a time to pay special attention to your health. Here are a few holiday tips to follow this holiday season:</p>
                                          <ol>
                                      <li>Wash hands often to keep yourself from spreading germs and getting sick. Wash your hands with soap and clean running water for at least 20 seconds.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                          <ol start="2">
                                      <li>Bundle up to stay dry and warm. Wear appropriate outdoor clothing: layers of light, warm clothing; mittens, hats, scarves, and waterproof boots.</li>
                                      <li>Manage stress. Don't over-commit yourself and prevent holiday anxiety and pressure. Get enough sleep.</li>
                                      <li>Don't drink and drive or let others drink and drive. Whenever anyone drives drunk, they put everyone on the road in danger.</li>
                                      <li>Be smoke-free. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke. There is NO safe amount of tobacco or secondhand smoke. Breathing even a little secondhand smoke can be dangerous.</li>
                                      <li>Fasten seat belts while driving or riding in a motor vehicle. Always buckle your child in the car using a child safety seat, booster seat, or seat belt according to his/her height, weight, and age. Use a seat belt on every trip, no matter how short the trip.</li>
                                      <li>Get exams and screenings. Ask what exams you need and when to get them. Update your personal and family history.</li>
                                      <li>Get your vaccinations, which help prevent diseases and save lives.</li>
                                      <li>Monitor the children. Keep potentially dangerous toys, food, drinks, household items, and other objects out of kids' reach. Dress warmly for outdoor activities. Develop and reinforce rules about acceptable and safe behaviors including electronic media.</li>
                                      <li>Practice fire safety. Most residential fires occur during the winter months, so be careful to never leave fireplaces, space heaters, stoves, or candles unattended. Have an emergency plan and practice it regularly.</li>
                                      <li>Prepare food safely. Remember these simple steps: wash hands and surfaces often, avoid cross-contamination, cook foods to proper temperatures, and refrigerate promptly.</li>
                                      <li>Eat healthy, and get moving. Eat fruits and vegetables. Limit your portion sizes and foods high in fat and sugar. Be active for at least 2Â½ hours a week and help kids and teens be active for at least 1 hour a day.</li>
                                    </ol>
