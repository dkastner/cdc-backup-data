<h3>A Pinch of Salt</h3>
          <p> You can bet Mary Poppins wouldn't have recommended a spoonful of salt  to help the medicine go down, but research shows that most <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/pressrel/2009/r090326.htm">Americans consume too  much salt</a>. Most of the  sodium we eat comes from packaged, processed, store-bought and restaurants  foods. Of that, only about 5% comes from salt added during cooking and about 6%  comes from being added at the table. The salt in our foods and  table salt is made up of sodium and chloride, and too much sodium can increase  blood pressure and consequently your risk for a heart attack or stroke. </p>

<h3>A Woman's World</h3>
          <p>Although heart disease is sometimes  thought of as a &quot;man's disease,&quot; it is the leading cause of death for  women in the United States, who account for nearly 50% of all heart disease  deaths. In 2006, heart disease was the cause of death in nearly 316,000  females. Heart disease is often perceived as an &quot;older woman's  disease,&quot; and it is the leading cause of death among women aged 65 years  and older. However, heart disease is the third leading cause of death among  women aged 25-44 years and the second leading cause of death among women aged  45-64 years. See the links below and remember many cases of heart disease can  be prevented! </p>

<h3>Every 25 Seconds</h3>
          <p>About every 25 seconds, an American  will have a coronary event and about one every minute will die from one.<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HeartDisease/index.htm"> Heart disease</a> is the leading cause  of death in the United States and in 2009, an estimated 785,000 Americans had a  new coronary attack, and about 470,000 will have a recurrent attack. <br />
            High cholesterol, high blood pressure,  obesity, diabetes, tobacco use, and secondhand smoke are risk factors  associated with heart disease. Â Making  your readers aware that what they eat, how physically active they are as well  as if they smoke and drink can have an impact on their chances of having a  heart attack might help save their lives.</p>

<h3>Take Five</h3>
          <p>Take five and rack up the savings!Â  Americans are always looking for ways to  save, and taking steps to improve your health and that of your family can help  you save money, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Features/HandlingStress/">stress</a> and time.Â  Being healthy and  safe takes commitment, but it doesn't have to be time-consuming, painful, or  boring. Most things are so simple and take so little time, that you'll wonder  why you've been avoiding them. You can get big rewards just by taking small  steps to prevent illness and injury. You won't necessarily &quot;see&quot; the  rewards, such as the extra pounds you didn't gain, the high blood pressure you  didn't get, the emergency room visit you avoided. Give your readers some good  advice and see how they save!</p>

<h3>Screen for Life</h3>
          <p>Of cancers affecting both men and women, <a href="../../cancer/colorectal/index.html">colorectal cancer (cancer of the  colon and rectum)</a> is the second leading cancer  killer in the United States.Â  Between the  ages of 50 and 60, the chance of getting colorectal cancer <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/statistics/age.htm">within the next  10 years doubles</a>.Â   Colorectal cancer can often be prevented through regular colorectal  cancer screening tests that can find precancerous polyps so they can be removed  before they have a chance to turn into cancer. Despite efforts to encourage  screening, an estimated 40% of adults aged 50 or olderâthe age group at  greatest risk of developing colorectal cancerâhave not been screened  appropriately. Make sure your readers take advantage of the screenings offered  and reduce their health risks.</p>

<h3>Get in, Get Out, and How to Stay Healthy in Between</h3>
          <p>Imagine a scenario like the following:  your mother starts having chest pain, your son breaks his ankle during football  practice or your spouse is in a car accident. You rush to the hospital and you  are told that your loved one is going to recover, but will spend some time in  the hospital.&nbsp; However, extra time in the hospital can also put patients at  risk for a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/healthDis.html">healthcare-associated  infection (HAI)</a>, such as a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dhqp/dpac_iv.html">bloodstream</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pubs.html">surgical  site</a>, or <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pubs.html">urinary tract infection</a>. Every day, patients get infections in healthcare facilities  while they are being treated for something else.&nbsp; In American hospitals alone,  healthcare-associated infections account for an estimated 1.7 million  infections and 99,000 associated deaths each year. Help your readers stay  healthier in the hospital with these tips.</p>

          <h3>World Kidney Day</h3>
          <p><a href="http://www.worldkidneyday.org/">March 11 is World Kidney Day</a>, an event intended to raise awareness of the importance of  prevention and early detection of kidney disease. In the United States, kidney  disease is the ninth leading cause of death, and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pubs/general.htm#what">diabetes</a> is the leading cause of chronic kidney disease. If current trends continue, 1 in 3 Americans will develop diabetes  sometime in their lifetime, and those with diabetes will lose, on average,  10â15 years of life. People with type 2 diabetes, the most common form  of diabetes among adults, have high rates of cholesterol and triglyceride  abnormalities, obesity, and high blood pressure, all of which are major  contributors to higher rates of cardiovascular disease.

          <p>HIV and AIDS were originally thought to affect mostly gay men. However,  women have always been affected too. And even though more men than women have  HIV, women are catching up. In fact, if new HIV infections continue at their current  rate worldwide, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/women/resources.htm">women  with HIV may soon outnumber men with HIV</a>. In 2007, more than a quarter of diagnoses of  HIV infection in the United States were among women and girls aged 13 years and  older. The numbers are unsettling: More than 278,000 women and adolescent girls  in this country are living with HIV; and almost 94,000 American women and girls  with AIDS have died since the epidemic began. Keep your female readers aware of the risks.</p>

							<h3>Trends in Tuberculosis</h3>
  
							<p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria that usually attacks the lungs, but can attack any part of the body. If not treated properly, TB disease can be fatal. Preliminary data from CDC's National TB Surveillance System show that although TB reached an all-time low in the U.S. in 2010, TB continues to significantly affect many communities, including racial/ethnic minorities, foreign-born individuals, and persons living with HIV. In 2010, a total of 11,181 TB cases were reported in the U.S. The rate declined 3.9 percent from 2009 to 2010, to 3.6 cases per 100,000 people. Despite declines, TB rates for all racial/ethnic minorities were higher than those of whites, with TB rates seven times higher for Hispanics, eight times higher for blacks, and 25 times higher for Asians. More TB cases were reported among Hispanics than any other racial/ethnic group. The TB rate for foreign-born individuals was 11 times higher than that of those born in the U.S. TB poses a particular risk to people living with HIV, and according to available data, nearly nine percent of people with TB were also infected with HIV. Drug resistance, which makes cases of TB more difficult and costly to treat, continues to pose a threat to TB control in the U.S. In 2009, approximately 1.3 percent of TB cases were multi-drug resistant (113 total cases).</p>

					<h3>"Take the Test, Take Control"</h3> 

					<p>Get ready. June 27 is National HIV Testing Day.  Getting tested for HIV is easy and the first step to improving your health and the health of  your partners. Every 9 Â½ minutes another person in the U.S. becomes infected  with HIV, and more than 200,000 Americans are living with HIV but don't know  it. Recent data indicate that African  Americans and gay and bisexual men of all races continue to be most severely  affected.Â  Early diagnosis is critical; too many people are getting tested and  diagnosed at advanced stages of disease, when treatments are less effective and  after years of lost opportunities to prevent transmission.Â  More information can be found at the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/Default.htm">National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis,  STD, and TB Prevention Newsroom</a>.</p>

<h3>Say "Ah"</h3>
  <p>Cooking out this summer? Who doesn't love a  big juicy burger? Cooking to a safe internal temperature of 160Â°F will ensure  that your burger is perfectly safe. However, it's important to be mindful of  foodborne illness or "food poisoning" when preparing summertime meals because  disease&ndash;causing bacteria are often more prevalent in warmer weather.Â  Many different agents of disease or pathogens  like E. coli and Salmonella can contaminate foods or beverages.</p>
  
 <p> Each year millions of people become sick from foodborne disease in the United States. The great majority of these illnesses  are mild and cause symptoms for only a day or two. But some foodborne illnesses are more serious &ndash; every year thousands of people are hospitalized  and some actually die from complications associated with foodborne  diseases.Â  The most severe illnesses tend  to occur in the very old, the very young, those who already have an illness  that reduces their immune system function, and in healthy people exposed to a  very high dose of disease &ndash; causing bacteria. Foodborne illnesses that  cause vomiting and diarrhea can be treated by replacing lost fluids and  electrolytes.Â  If you experience a  diarrheal illness and it's accompanied by high fever, blood in the stool,  prolonged vomiting and signs of dehydration please consult a health care  provider. </p>

					<h3>Fireworks Safety</h3>

					<p>Firecrackers and sparklers, lots of BBQ and grilled hamburgers and hot dogs are some of the ways we celebrate the holidays. Cautions about fireworks are always important, especially around 4th of July celebrations and cookouts when most fireworks injuries occur. Many communities have fireworks displays that are handled by professionals. Be safe. Avoid the common fireworks injuries; leave the fireworks to the professionals.

						  <h3>Care for the caregivers</h3>

							<p>Caregivers are  people who provide assistance to someone who is, to some degree, incapacitated  and needs help. Typically, recipients of care have a chronic illness or  disabling condition, and need ongoing assistance with everyday tasks in order  to function on a daily basis. As the number of older American rises, so does  the number of needed caregivers. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/aging/caregiving/index.htm">Caregiving</a> exacts a tremendous toll on caregiversâ health and well-being, and accounts for  significant costs to families and society as well.</p>
                            <p>Although challenging, caregiving is generally undertaken voluntarily and most people indicate that  they found it personally fulfilling (Family Caregiver Alliance, 2006). Most  caregivers can identify positive aspects of providing care, which can assist  with coping and lower perceived burden. However, some caregivers may face  stress, burden, depression, and negative health effects from their duties. Many  caregivers do not adhere to recommendations to follow a healthy diet and  exercise program and tend to avoid preventive care for themselves. If your  readers or viewers have a family member who needs long&ndash;term care, share this  RE-AIM framework, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/aging/pdf/caregiving_monograph.pdf">&ldquo;Assuring Healthy Caregivers&rdquo;,</a> with them. You can also visit  the links below to learn more about caregiving:</p>

					<h3>Lesson 1: Safety First </h3>

					<p>55 million students will be returning to classrooms across the United States this fall.  If this includes your children, there are things you can do to help them.  From an early age, safety awareness is key.  Whether it is by car, bus, bike, or walking, the minute a child leaves home, safety becomes a concern. Children need to use seatbelts, look both ways before crossing a street, wear helmets when appropriate, take steps to form respectful relationships, and know how to avoid and reduce conflicts. Safety is also important at school, both in the classroom and during activities such as sports. When parents and educators work together, safety becomes a lifesaving priority that benefits the entire community. In honor of August, National Immunization Awareness Month, CDC would like to remind parents to update their children's vaccinations before school starts. Doing so will protect your child and others from various illnesses.</p>

					<h3>Drive with Caution</h3>

					<p>Motor vehicles have made travel easier and promoted economic and social development in many countries.  Because of the widely-known benefits of motor vehicles, it may be easy to forget they can be a danger to drivers and pedestrians alike. Globally, every year, about 1.3 million people are killed in motor vehicle crashes and 20-50 million more are seriously injured.  By 2020, motor vehicle crashes are expected to become the third most serious threat to human health in the world, making safe driving one of the foremost priorities in public health.</p>

					<p>In the U.S., motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for teens, accounting for more than one in three deaths in this age group.  In 2008, nine teens ages 16 to 19 died every day from motor vehicle injuries. Per mile driven, teen drivers ages 16 to 19 are four times more likely than older drivers to crash. Fortunately, teen motor vehicle crashes are preventable, and proven strategies can improve the safety of young drivers on the road.</p>

					<p>Texting while driving, as well as distracted driving, is becoming a well known problem among drivers of all ages.  In 2008, nearly 6,000 people of all ages died in crashes involving a distracted driver and more than 500,000 were injured. Because of these surprising numbers, the Department of Transportation recently launched the national campaign "Put it Down" to encourage the public to end distracted driving.</p>

					<h3>Prostate Cancer<br />Be Aware. Be Prepared.</h3>

					<p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer death. African American men, men above the age of 50, and men who have someone in their family who has had prostate cancer are at a higher risk for having the disease. Some medical experts believe all men should be offered regular screening tests for prostate cancer.  Other medical experts do not.  While there is uncertainty about the benefit of screening, the need for more men to be aware of the risk is undeniable.  In 2006, 203,415 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 28,372 men died from it.</p>

					<p>CDC provides a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/pdf/prosguide.pdf">prostate cancer screening decision guide [369 KB]</a>  that can be helpful to someone who is weighing the decision of whether to get screened by a doctor or not. The symptoms of prostate cancer can go undetected due to the fact that some men do not show symptoms, but if present the symptoms to notice are:</p>

					<ul class="bulleted-links">
						<li>Difficulty in starting urination.</li>

<h3>Ear infections &ndash; will antibiotics help?</h3>

<p>All members of your family can be  affected by ear infections and when you or your children are suffering, the answer  might be antibiotics. But, when the ear infection is caused by a virus, taking  antibiotics may do more harm than good. Your readers need to know that each  time they take an antibiotic unnecessarily, bacteria that normally live in  their bodies are encouraged to become antibiotic-resistant. This means that the  next time they get sick they are more likely to become ill with an  antibiotic-resistant infection.</p>
<p>There are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/URI/ear-infection.html#a">three  main types of ear infections</a>, which have different causes and treatments:  acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and otitis externa. Your  healthcare provider can determine what kind of ear infection is present and if  treatment is needed. Parents are warned that if your child is younger than  three months old, it is important to call your doctor immediately. Signs that  your child may have an ear infection are pulling at the ears, excessive crying,  fluid draining from their ears and fever. </p>
<p>To <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/URI/ear-infection.html#h">prevent</a> ear infections, avoid smoking or exposure to second hand smoke. Be sure to keep  you and your child up to date with recommended immunizations and breastfeed your  baby for 12 months or more if possible. Healthcare providers may decide to wait  a couple of days before prescribing antibiotics since you or your child may get  better without them. Rest, over-the-counter medicines and self-care methods may  relieve the symptoms of ear infections without the misuse of antibiotics. But  remember, many over-the-counter products are not recommended for young  children.</p>

					<h3>National Cholesterol Education Month</h3>

					<p>What has no symptoms to notice, and yet puts more than 35 million people at high risk for heart disease? The answer is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in your body and many foods. Your body needs cholesterol to function normally but too much cholesterol can build up in your arteries. After a while, these deposits narrow your arteries, putting you at risk for heart disease and stroke. High cholesterol usually doesn't have any symptoms. As a result, many people do not know that their cholesterol levels are too high. However, doctors can do a simple blood test to check your cholesterol. High cholesterol can be controlled through lifestyle changes or if it is not enough, through medications. Explain to your readers that it is important to check their cholesterol levels. High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.</p>

					<p>This September, tell your readers how to celebrate National Cholesterol Education Month by lowering their cholesterol:</p>

					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Low-fat and high-fiber food (Eat more fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and whole grains).</li>
						<li>For adults, get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes of moderate or 1 hour and 15 minutes of vigorous physical activity a week. For those aged 6-  17, get 1 hour or more of physical activity each day.</li>
						<li>Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
						<li>Don't smoke or quit if you do smoke.</li>

					<h3>Emergency Preparedness</h3>

					<p>Though we may not be able to know exactly when an emergency or natural disaster will take place, we can still be prepared.  Early preparation is especially important for people with chronic health condition. In an emergency situation or natural disaster, access to health care providers can be limited. National Preparedness Month is aimed to encourage people to know what to do during an emergency or a disaster, such as a flood or fire.  To make sure that you are as prepared as possible the CDC suggests some tools you may want to have in the event of an emergency.</p>

<h3>Watch Your Step<br />Preventing Falls in Older Adults</h3>

					<p>Every year, one in three adults age 65 and older falls. Twenty to 30 percent of those who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries that can threaten their ability to live healthy, independent lives. Your readers should know what simple steps they can take to lower these risks. One of the very best ways to reduce the risk of falling is by exercising regularly in order to strengthen legs and help improve balance, but it's important to talk to a health care provider before starting an exercise routine. Second, readers should be sure to tell their health care provider all the medications they are taking, to be sure there are no drug side effects or interactions that could affect balance.   Third, it's important to have annual eye examinations and to update prescriptions to improve vision as much as possible. Finally, other steps people can take around the house to reduce their chances of falling include removing trip hazards, adding brighter lights, putting non-stick mats on shower and bathtub floors, installing grab bars next to and inside the shower or tub, and adding railings on both sides of the stairs (indoor and outdoor).</p>

					<h3>Breast Cancer Awareness Month</h3>

					<p>Not counting some kinds of skin cancer, breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States. It is the most common cause of death from cancer among Hispanic women, and the second most common cause of death from cancer among white, black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.</p>

					<p>A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. Mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early when it is easier to treat and before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. Women between the ages of 40 and 49 should talk to their doctor about when to start getting mammograms. Women who are 50 or older should get a screening mammogram every two years.</p>

					<p>CDC's <a href="../../cancer/nbccedp/index.html">National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP)</a> offers free or low-cost mammograms to women who qualify.</p>

					<h3>National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week 2010</h3>

					<p>Today, lead poisoning is considered the most preventable environmental disease among young children, yet approximately 250,000 U.S. children aged 1-5 years have elevated blood-lead levels. Because lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious symptoms, it frequently goes unrecognized. A simple blood test can prevent permanent damage that will last a lifetime.</p>

					<p>National Lead Poisoning Prevention Week is October 24-30, 2010. Educate readers by raising awareness about childhood lead poisoning, stressing the importance of testing the home and screening young children for lead, and urging people to take steps to reduce lead exposure.</p>

					<h3>School Nutrition</h3>

					<p>Children in the United States are becoming increasingly overweight and obese, and most do not meet recommendations for a healthy diet. The school environment is one of several settings that can influence children's food choices and eating habits. By ensuring that only nutritious food options are available, schools can model healthy eating behaviors and help improve dietetic intake. Tell your readers what they can do to engage in efforts to improve the school nutrition environment by supporting strong state and district school nutrition standards, reviewing the district's school wellness policy, examining the foods and beverages that are available to students and educating students about nutrition and offering healthy foods and beverages.</p>

					<h3>Achieve Freedom! How to Quit Smoking</h3>

					<p>Did you know the benefits to quitting smoking begin just 20 minutes after your last cigarette? One out of every five deaths in the United States is caused by tobacco use. On average, adults who smoke die 14 years earlier than nonsmokers. Help your readers understand that by quitting smoking, they lower their risk for cancer, heart disease, stroke and respiratory diseases.

<h3>Healthy Holidays</h3>

					<p>Family, funâ¦and FOOD! It's what the holidays are all about, right? But that doesn't mean you have to pack on the holiday pounds. Balance the calories you consume with the calories you burn, and avoid any holiday weight gain. Here are some ways to help you do just that:</p>

					<h5>Take the Extra Calories Out of Cooking!</h5>

					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>If you're heading out to a party&mdash;holiday, birthday or any sort&mdash;eat a light, healthy snack before you go. Broth-based soups, cereal with skim milk, or just plain fruit are all good options! This will help curb your hunger and decrease your visits to the buffet table.</li>
						<li>Modify recipes to reduce the amount of fat and calories. For example, when making lasagna, use part-skim ricotta cheese instead of whole-milk ricotta cheese. Substitute shredded vegetables, such as carrots, zucchini, and spinach for some of the ground meat in lasagna.</li>
						<li>Bring a low-fat, holiday dish to the party. Need some suggestions? Visit CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/healthyweight/healthy_eating/recipes.htm">Healthy Recipes</a> site for details.</li>
						<li>When eating or snacking in front of the TV, put the amount that you plan to eat into a bowl or container instead of eating straight from the package. It's easy to overeat when your attention is focused on something else.</li>
						<li>Choose water, diet, or low-calorie beverages instead of sugar-sweetened beverages.</li>
						<li>Limit your alcoholic beverage intake. Alcoholic drinks can have many calories, especially holiday favorites like eggnog. Cut or limit your alcohol calories by drinking more water.</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>Get Active, Healthy and Happy!</h5>

					<ul class="bullet-list">
						<li>Make a goal with a friend to meet the new Physical Activity Guidelines! Visit CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html">Physical Activity for Everyone</a> site for details.</li>
						<li>Sign up for a 5K walk or run to keep your mind focused on physical activity goals. Maintain your physical activity during the holidaysâ better yet, try and get more active! It will make those New Year's resolutions even easier to attain.</li>
						<li>Find fun, creative ways your friends and family can spend time being active instead of eating. Be sure and spend time together that doesn't revolve around a meal.</li>
          </ul>

					<h3>Protecting Internationally Adopted Children from Lead Poisoning</h3>

					<p>Prospective parents adopting a child from overseas need information to safeguard the health of the child from lead poisoning, which can cause several health problems, including brain damage. The risk for lead exposure is much higher in many countries from which children are adopted than in the United States.  Each country sets its own policies or regulations for environmental exposures, including lead, and some countries have stronger regulations than others.  CDC has information on this topic for adoptive parents and health care providers.</p>

					<p>November is National Adoption Month.   The U.S. Department of State's Office of Children's Issues shows that from October 1, 2008, to September 30, 2009, a total of 12,753 internationally adopted children immigrated to the United States.  The largest numbers of these children were originally from Ethiopia, mainland China, South Korea, and Russia.</p>

					<p>Foreign-born adopted children tend to have higher levels of lead in their blood than children born in the United States. Readers can learn more about how internationally adopted children may have been exposed to lead before they came to the United States, and what they can do take to get the child proper diagnostic screenings and follow-up care if needed.</p>

					<h5>Important points to emphasize</h5>

					<p>Internationally adopted children can be exposed to lead from a number of sources including, cooking utensils and cosmetics, leaded gasoline, exhaust, drinking water from metal pipes or storage containers, exhaust and air pollution from nearby mining and smelting plants and industrial emissions.</p>

					<p>Most children with elevated blood-lead levels do not have any symptom. Simple blood tests are the only way to determine if a child has an elevated blood lead level.</p>

					<h3>Staying Healthy with Diabetes</h3>

					<p>Diabetes is a disease in which blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are above normal. It can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and amputations of feet and legs. Diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, occurs when a person's body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use its own insulin as well as it should. Type 2 diabetes, which is associated with obesity and physical inactivity, accounts for about 90 to 95 percent of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. Risk factors for type 2 diabetes include older age, obesity, family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, physical inactivity, and race/ethnicity. Regular physical activity and loss of a small amount of weight (5 to 7 percent of total body weight) can significantly reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p>

					<p>Explain to your readers that type 2 diabetes can have no obvious symptoms, and that many people with the disease do not know they have it. Anyone aged 45 years or older should consider getting tested for type 2 diabetes, especially if they are overweight. If they are younger than 45, but are overweight and have one or more additional risk factors, they should consider testing. People with diabetes can reduce their risk of complications by maintaining healthy blood glucose levels, body weight, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, exercising, getting the annual flu vaccination, and, if they smoke, quitting.</p>

					<h3>Protect Yourself this Season: Get Vaccinated</h3>

					<p>Now is the time to get vaccinated against seasonal flu. Flu activity in the United States is low now, making this an excellent time to get a flu vaccine. Everyone 6 months and older should get vaccinated, even if they got a seasonal or 2009 H1N1 vaccine last season. The 2010-2011 flu vaccine has been updated to protect against the three flu viruses that CDC expects will cause the most illness in the United States this season. Help your readers find where they can get flu vaccine this season with this list of <a href="http://www.flu.gov/individualfamily/vaccination/locator.html">vaccine locations</a>.</p>

					<p>Another important vaccine to get is one against pertussis, or whooping cough. Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease that affects people of all ages. It can be fatal, especially in babies less than 1 year of age. From January to October 26, 2010, more than 6,200 cases of pertussis (including ten infant deaths) were reported throughout California. This is the most cases reported by California in 60 years. Share with readers that the most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with DTaP for infants and children and with Tdap for pre-teens, teens and adults. Getting vaccinated is especially important for families with new infants.</p>

					<h3>Youth Violence through New Technology</h3>

					<p>Today, young people are using new media technology and new communication avenues such as text messaging, chat rooms, and social networking websites to communicate with others in the U.S. and throughout the world. This technology has many intellectual and social benefits. However, electronic media can be used by youth to embarrass, harass or threaten their peers. An increasing number of teens and pre-teens are becoming victims of this form of "electronic aggression." It is important for parents to be aware of this trend and how it may affect their children. Tips for parents and caregivers include talking to children, developing rules, exploring the sites their child visits, talking with other parents, connecting with the school, and educating themselves on new technology their child is using.</p>

					<h3>Tired? Give yourself some extra rest this holiday season</h3>

					<p>It's that time again, when people are hustling and bustling in anticipation of the holidays. It seems like there are endless errands to run and presents to wrap. But one thing to remind your readers about is the importance of a good night's sleep.  Sufficient sleep is increasingly being recognized as an essential aspect of health promotion and chronic disease prevention in the public health community. Insufficient sleep is associated with chronic diseases such as <a href="../../diabetes.1.html">diabetes</a>, <a href="../../heartdisease.1.html">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="../../obesity/index.html">obesity</a>, and mental illnesses including depression.  It can also result in drowsy driving which can lead to motor vehicle accidents. According to the <a href="http://www.sleepfoundation.org/article/how-sleep-works/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need">National Sleep Foundation</a>, adults need 7-9 hours of sleep a night, and children and teens need more. Approximately 29 percent of U.S. adults report sleeping less than 7 hours per night and an estimated 50-70 million has chronic sleep and wakefulness disorders. Ten percent of American adults report experiencing chronic insomnia. Explain to readers that sufficient sleep is not a luxury, but a necessity for good health.</p>

					<h3>Here comes Jack Frost!</h3>

					<p>It's getting colder outside and whether your readers love playing in the snow or prefer being bundled up by a fire, share with them some important safety tips about <a href="http://emergency.cdc.gov/disasters/winter/">winter weather</a>. Did you know cold weather puts an extra strain on the heart? If you have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart/">heart disease</a> or high blood pressure, talk to a doctor about working in the cold. Cold temperatures can also be particularly dangerous for infants and the elderly. Staying indoors can help reduce the risk of car crashes and falls on ice, but there are also indoor hazards. Stay warm safely by keeping anything that can burn at least 3 feet away from heating equipment, such as the furnace, fireplace, wood stove, or portable heater. These actions can reduce the risk for a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Features/FirePrevention/">home fire</a>. Following these prevention tips will prepare your readers for whatever winter weather comes their way!</p>

					<h3>On the Road Again&hellip; Holiday Road Safety</h3>

					<p>During the upcoming holiday season, and all year, remind readers to keep safety in mind whenever they are on the road.  Wearing a seat belt can reduce the risk of dying in a crash by about half.  Also, make sure young passengers are buckled into appropriate safety seats. The safest place for children of any age to ride is properly restrained in the back seat. Data show that child safety seats reduce the risk of death in car crashes by 71 percent for infants and 54 percent for toddlers ages one to four.</p>

					<p>Share with readers some steps to make sure that they and everyone they celebrate with avoids driving under the influence of alcohol. 1. Plan ahead. Always designate a non-drinking driver before any holiday party or celebration begins. 2. Take the keys.  Don't let friends drive if they are impaired. 3. Be a helpful host. If you're hosting a party this holiday season, remind your guests to plan ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages; and make sure all of your guests leave with a sober driver.</p>

					<p>It's always important to talk with your teen about the dangers of drivingâand keep the conversation going. Extend your teen's supervised driving period and help your teen develop the skills he or she needs by providing as many supervised practice driving hours as possible. Set the rules of the road. Practice driving will empower a teen, but rules will provide much needed limits to keep him or her safe. Enforce the rules with a Parent-Teen Driving Agreement. No matter what time of year it is, tips from CDC's Injury Center on <a href="../../motorvehiclesafety/index.html">motor vehicle safety</a> can help you protect yourself, your passengers, and your family and friends.</p>
