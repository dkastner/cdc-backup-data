                        <p>Through the National  Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP), the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides low-income, uninsured, and  underserved women access to timely breast and cervical cancer screening and  diagnostic services.</p>
                        <p>To improve access to  screening, Congress passed the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/legislation/law.htm">Breast and  Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990,</a> which guided CDC in creating the  NBCCEDP. Currently, the NBCCEDP funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia,  5 U.S. territories, and 11 American Indian/Alaska Native tribes or tribal  organizations to provide screening services for breast and cervical cancer. The  program helps low-income, uninsured, and underinsured women gain access to  breast and cervical cancer screening, diagnostic and treatment services. </p>
                        <p>In 2000, Congress passed  the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/nbccedp/legislation/law106-354.htm">Breast  and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act,</a> which gives states the option to  offer women diagnosed with cancer through the NBCCEDP access to treatment  through Medicaid. To date, all 50 states and the District of Columbia have  approved this Medicaid option. In 2001, with passage of the Native American  Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Technical Amendment Act, Congress expanded  this option to American Indians/Alaska Natives who are eligible for health  services provided by the Indian Health Service or by a tribal organization.</p>

<p>Diabetes is often  diagnosed in women during their childbearing years and can affect the health of  both the woman and her unborn child. <strong>Poor control of diabetes during  pregnancy increases the chances for </strong><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/documents/Diabetes_and_Pregnancy508.pdf"><strong>problems</strong> [1.24 MB]</a><strong> for the woman and her baby.</strong> Control of blood sugar during pregnancy  can help prevent those problems.</p>
                        <p>Gestational  diabetes is first recognized in a pregnant  woman who did not have diabetes before  pregnancy. It shows up mid-pregnancy; hence testing is usually done at 24–28  weeks of pregnancy. Often gestational diabetes can be controlled through eating  healthy foods and regular exercise, butsometimes insulin is needed, too.</p>
                        <p>To help control  gestational diabetes </p>
                        <p><strong>Eat healthy foods</strong>. Eat healthy foods from a meal plan made for a  person with diabetes. A dietitian or certified diabetes educator can help you  create a healthy meal plan. <br />

                        <p><strong>Exercise regularly. </strong>Exercise is another way to keep blood sugar under  control. It helps to balance food intake. After checking with your doctor, you  can exercise regularly during and after pregnancy. <br />
                          <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/pregnancy.html">Learn more about physical activity during  pregnancy »</a></p>
                        <p><strong>Monitor blood sugar often</strong>. Because pregnancy causes the body&rsquo;s need for  energy to change, blood sugar levels can change very quickly. Check your blood  sugar often, as directed by your doctor. </p>
                        <p><strong>Get tested for diabetes after pregnancy</strong>. Get tested for diabetes 6 to 12 weeks  after your baby is born, and then every 1 to 3 years. Gestational diabetes  usually goes away soon after delivery. If not, the diabetes is called type 2  diabetes. Half of all women who had gestational diabetes develop type 2  diabetes later. It's important to continue to exercise and eat a healthy diet  after pregnancy to prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes. </p>

                        <p>A heart attack, also called a myocardial infarction,  occurs when a section of the heart muscle dies or gets damaged because of  reduced blood supply. Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) occurs when a substance  called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart (called  coronary arteries). CAD is the main cause of heart attack. The five major  symptoms of a heart attack are—</p>
                        <ul class="bulleted-links">
                          <li>Pain or discomfort in the jaw, neck, or back.</li>
                          <li>Feeling weak, light-headed, or faint.</li>
                          <li>Chest pain or discomfort.</li>
                          <li>Pain or discomfort in arms or shoulder.</li>
                          <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>If you believe you or someone are experiencing the symptoms  of a heart attack it is important to  to  call 9-1-1 immediately.</strong> Otherwise, further  damage to the heart muscle can occur and an irregular heart rhythm may develop.</p>
                        <p>Bystanders who have been trained to perform cardiopulmonary  resuscitation (CPR) or use a defibrillator may be able  to help the victim until emergency medical personnel arrive. At the hospital,  doctors will then perform tests to determine whether a heart attack is  occurring and decide on the best treatment.</p>
                        <p><strong>Remember, it’s important to recognize these symptoms and  call for help because the chances of surviving a heart attack are greater when  emergency treatment begins quickly.</strong></p>

                        <p>Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder in which the  blood does not clot properly. This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding  following injuries or surgery. Because the genetic mutation that causes  hemophilia is carried in the X chromosome, men are more severely affected.  However, some women (referred to as carriers of the hemophilia gene mutation)  can also be affected.</p>
                        <p>Blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that  help to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels of either factor  VIII (8) or factor IX (9). Depending on how much clotting factor is in the  blood, a person&rsquo;s hemophilia may be mild, moderate, or severe. </p>
                        <p>The two most common types of hemophilia are:</p>
                        <ul class="bulleted-links">
                          <li>Hemophilia A (Classic Hemophilia) - This type is       caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor VIII. </li>
                          <li>Hemophilia B (Christmas Disease) - This type is       caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor IX.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hemophilia occurs in about 1 of every 5,000 male births.  Currently, about 20,000 U.S. males are living with the disorder. Hemophilia A  is about four times as common as hemophilia B and about half of those affected  by Hemophilia A have the severe form of the disorder. Hemophilia affects people  from all racial and ethnic groups.</p>
                        <p>The severity of hemophilia that a person has is  determined by the level of the clotting factor in the blood. The lower the clotting  level, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur that may lead to more serious  complications.</p>
                        <p><strong>Hemophilia can result in</strong>: </p>
                        <ul class="bulleted-links">
                          <li>Bleeding within joints that can lead to chronic joint disease and pain</li>
                          <li>Bleeding in the head and sometimes in the brain, which can cause long-term problems such as seizures and paralysis </li>
                          <li>Death can occur if the bleeding cannot be stopped or if it occurs in a vital organ such as the brain</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the  missing blood clotting factor so that the blood can clot properly. This is done  by infusing (giving medication by injection into a vein) commercially prepared factor concentrates.People with hemophilia can learn how to perform these  infusions themselves so that they can stop bleeding episodes. By performing the infusions on a regular  basis,  people with hemophilia can also prevent  most bleeding episodes. </p>
                        <p>Hemophilia is a complex disorder. Good quality medical care provided by  doctors and nurses knowledgable  about the disorder can help prevent serious problems. Often the best choice for  this care is to visit a comprehensive Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC).  An HTC provides care to address all issues related to the disorder, and also,  provides education that helps people with hemophilia stay healthy. </p>

 <p>Traumatic  brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health issue for Americans. Each year,  TBI contributes to a substantial number of deaths and permanent disability. A  TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury  that disrupts the normal function of the brain. The severity of a TBI may range  from &quot;mild&quot; to &quot;severe&quot;. </p>
                        <p>According to research from CDC, approximately 3.5 million persons have a TBI in the United States. Of these individuals:</p>
                        <ul class="bullet-list">
                          <li>2.1 million received care in emergency departments,</li>
                          <li>300,000 were hospitalized,</li>
                          <li>84,000 were seen in outpatient departments,</li>
                          <li>1.1 million received care from office-based physicians, and</li>
                          <li>53,000 died.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Previously referred to as the &quot;Silent Epidemic,&quot; individuals with this injury may not have any visible scars, and symptoms may not show up or be noticed until hours or days later. Still, a TBI can cause short or long-term problems se¬riously affecting thinking, learning, memory, and/or emotions. A TBI can affect all aspects of an individual’s life, as well as that of their loved ones. This may include relationships with family and friends, as well as their ability to work or be employed, do household tasks, or drive a car. </p>
                        <p> The most common causes of TBI are from falls and car crashes. While there is no one-size-fits all solution, there are many ways to reduce the chances of a TBI, including:</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Wearing a seat belt every time you drive or ride in a motor vehicle.</li>
                          <li>Never driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
                          <li>Avoiding activities that can distract you while you drive, such as using a cell phone, texting, and eating.</li>
                          <li>Wearing a helmet and making sure your children wear helmets while riding a bike.</li>
                          <li>Helping prevent falls by:
                            <ul class="bullet-list">
                              <li>Encouraging older adults to improve their balance and coordination by exercising.</li>
                              <li>Using safety gates at the top and bottom of stairs to prevent young children from falling.</li>
                            </ul>

</div>                         
                        
                        
                        <p>March  10 is National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, a day to recognize the  unique risks HIV and AIDS pose for women and girls, and to raise awareness of  the disease's impact on them. </p>
                        <p>National  Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day is a time each year when organizations  and communities across the United States come together to offer support,  encourage discussion, and teach women and girls about HIV prevention, the  importance of getting tested, and how to live with and manage HIV and AIDS, if  they are HIV-infected.</p>
                        <p>The rate  of new HIV infections among black women was 20 times as high as that of white  women andnearly 5 times as high as that of Latina women in 2010. The rate  of new HIV infections among Latinas was more than 4 times higher than white  women. The reasons why black and Latina women  are more affected by HIV and AIDS than women of other racial and ethnic groups  are not directly related to race or ethnicity, but rather to the circumstances  that often place some of these women and girls at greater risk of becoming  infected with HIV. These circumstances may include higher rates of HIV and  other sexually transmitted infections in communities of color, limited access  to high-quality health care, economic disadvantages, stigma, fear, and discrimination. </p>
                        <p>CDC  is committed to ensuring that all women, especially populations that are most  heavily affected, are armed with the tools necessary to prevent HIV. For  example, <a href="http://www.actagainstaids.org/promote/takecharge/tatc.html" target="_blank"><em>Take Charge. Take the Test</em></a> is a  multi-faceted communication campaign designed to increase HIV testing among  black/African American women. This effort, which is part of CDC's national <em>Act  Against AIDS</em> communication campaign, helps African American women recognize  their risk of getting HIV and the need for HIV testing. It also empowers them  by providing information, encourages them to get tested, and enables them to  take charge of their lives—whatever their HIV test result.</p>
                        <p>There  are several ways you can reduce your risk for getting HIV. Below are a few  things you can do to look out for yourself and stay healthy.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Don't have sex. Abstaining from sex  means not having any type of sex at all—oral, anal, or vaginal. Abstinence is  100 percent effective in preventing sexual transmission of HIV.</li>
                          <li>Practice mutual monogamy. Being  sexually active with only one person who has agreed to be sexually active only  with you is one of the best ways to protect yourself from HIV. Your chances of  getting HIV will also be lower if both of you have recently tested negative for  HIV. Also, talk to your partner about sex and HIV. Learn as much as you can  about their past behavior (sex and drug use) and consider the risks to your  health before you have sex.</li>
                          <li>Use a condom. Using a latex condom  every time you have oral, anal, or vaginal sex reduces your risk of HIV. Other  forms of birth control don't protect you from getting HIV. Male and female  condoms are the only effective form of birth control that also helps reduce the  risk of transmission for HIV and most other STDs. If you do have sex, use a  latex condom every time.</li>
                          <li>Don't share certain items. Don't share  needles, syringes and related works or anything else that might bring you into  contact with someone else's blood or bodily fluids. HIV is not transmitted by  casual contact, so it's ok to shake hands or share dishes with someone who is  living with HIV.</li>
                          <li>Don't use drugs or alcohol with sex.  Don't have sex when you are taking drugs or drinking alcohol because being high  or intoxicated can make you more likely to make unsafe sexual decisions.</li>
                          <li>Get tested for STDs. If you think you  may have been exposed to another STD such as gonorrhea, syphilis, or chlamydia,  get tested. Studies show that STDs can facilitate both transmission and  acquisition of HIV. So get tested (and treated, if necessary) for STDs. Find an  STD testing site near you by typing your zip code into the <a href="http://www.hivtest.org" target="_blank">testing site locator.</a></li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Make  National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day a day to get the facts about  HIV—to learn how HIV is spread, if you are at risk, and how to protect yourself  and your loved ones. Take this opportunity to also get tested. HIV testing is  the first critical step to knowing your status and protecting your health as  well as protecting  your partner. In fact, CDC recommends that all adults and  adolescents be tested at least once in their lifetime and frequent testing for  those individuals who practice more risky behaviors. And start talking openly  about HIV. Speak to everyone you know about HIV – friends and family, coworkers  and neighbors, at work and at places of worship. Have ongoing and open  discussions with your partners about HIV testing and risk behaviors.</p>

                        <p>Every 20 seconds, a child dies from a disease that could be  prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. Millions more children survive,  but are left severely disabled. Vaccines have the power not only to save, but  also transform lives by protecting against disease – giving children a chance  to grow up healthy, go to school, and improve their lives.  Vaccination campaigns sometimes provide the  only contact with health care services that children receive in their early  years of life. </p>
                        <p> Immunization is one of the most successful and  cost-effective health interventions—it currently averts an estimated 2 to 3  million deaths every year in all age groups from diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis  (whooping cough), and measles. </p>
                        <p> Immunization is a global health priority at CDC focusing on  polio eradication, reducing measles deaths, and strengthening immunization  systems. CDC works closely with a wide variety of partners in more than 60  countries to vaccinate children and provide technical assistance to ministries  of health to strengthen and expand countries&rsquo; abilities to create, carry out,  and evaluate their national immunization programs.</p>
                        <p>Too few people realize that the health of Americans and the  health of people around the world are inextricably linked. Viruses don&rsquo;t  respect borders, so they travel easily within countries and across continents.  By helping to stop vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) globally, CDC is also  helping to protect people in the United States against importations of VPDs  from other countries.</p>
                        <p>For example, in 2011, there were 220 reported cases of  measles in the United States—200 of the 220 cases were brought into the U.S.  from other countries with measles outbreaks.</p>
                        <p> The most effective and least expensive way to protect  Americans from diseases and other health threats that begin overseas is to stop  them before they spread to our shores. CDC works 24/7 to protect the American  people from disease both in the United States and overseas. CDC has dedicated  and caring experts in <a href="../../globalhealth/countries/default.htm">over 60 countries</a>.  They detect and control outbreaks at their source, saving lives and reducing  healthcare costs. In 2012, CDC responded to over 200 outbreaks around the  world, preventing disease spread to the U.S. </p>
                        <p> CDC's global health activities protect Americans at home and  save lives abroad. They reduce the need for U.S. assistance and create goodwill  and good relationships with global neighbors.</p>

                        <p>April marks Alcohol Awareness Month, a nationwide campaign intended to  raise awareness of the health and social problems that excessive alcohol  consumption can cause for individuals, their families, and their communities.  Excessive drinking is a dangerous behavior for both men and women. This year,  CDC is drawing attention to the risks to women's health from binge drinking,  the most common type of excessive alcohol consumption by adults.</p>
                        <p> According to a new <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/VitalSigns/BingeDrinkingFemale/index.html"><em>Vital Signs</em></a> report, more than 14 million U.S. women  binge drink about 3 times a month, and consume an average of 6 drinks per  binge. Drinking too much, including binge drinking (defined for women as  consuming 4 or more drinks on an occasion) results in about 23,000 deaths in  women and girls each year and increases the chances of breast cancer, heart  disease, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and many other  health problems.</p>
                        <p> Despite these risks,  about 1 in 8 adult women and 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink. Binge  drinking is a problem for all women and girls, but it is most common in high  school girls and young women, whites and Hispanics, and among women with household  incomes of $75,000 or more. Half of all high school girls who drink alcohol  report binge drinking.</p>

                        <p>CDC  is leading a national education campaign initiative called <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/knowmorehepatitis">Know More Hepatitis</a>. The  campaign aims to decrease the burden of chronic viral hepatitis by increasing awareness  about this hidden epidemic and encouraging baby boomers (people born 1945-1965)  to get tested.</p>
                        <p>Know  More Hepatitis is being featured in May as part of Hepatitis Awareness Month.  This year, May 19th will serve as the second <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/Hepatitis/HepatitisTestingDay.htm">Hepatitis  Testing Day</a> in the United States. Since chronic hepatitis often does not cause any symptoms  until serious liver damage has been done, testing for hepatitis is crucial.  Find out if you are at risk by taking a 5 minute online <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/HEPATITIS/riskassessment">Hepatitis Risk Assessment</a>.</p>
                        <p>This  online assessment is designed to determine an individual&rsquo;s risk for viral  hepatitis by asking questions based on CDC&rsquo;s guidelines for testing and  vaccination. The Assessment allows individuals to answer questions privately  and print their recommendations to discuss with their doctor.</p>
                        <p>The  word &quot;hepatitis&quot; means inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis is most often  caused by one of several viruses, which is why it is often called viral  hepatitis. In the United States, the most common types of viral hepatitis are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/A/index.htm">Hepatitis A</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/B/index.htm">Hepatitis B</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/C/index.htm">Hepatitis C.</a></p>
                        <p>Unlike  Hepatitis A, which does not cause a long-term infection, Hepatitis B and  Hepatitis C can become chronic, life-long infections. Chronic viral hepatitis  can lead to serious liver problems including liver cancer. More than 1 million  Americans are living with chronic Hepatitis B and 3 million with chronic  Hepatitis C in the United States but most do not know they are infected.  The vast majority of those infected with hepatitis C are baby boomers, or those  born from 1945 through 1965. CDC recommends that everyone born during  these years be tested for hepatitis C.</p>
                        <p>Both  Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C can cause liver cancer and have contributed to the  increase in rates of liver cancer in recent decades. Hepatitis C is a leading  cause of liver cancer, which is the fastest-rising cause of cancer-related  deaths in the U.S., as well as the most common indication for liver  transplants. Hepatitis C is also responsible for more than 15,000 deaths  each year (a number that has nearly doubled over the past decade). </p>
                        <p>With  early detection, many people can get lifesaving care and treatment that can  limit disease progression, and prevent cancer deaths. To find out if you should  be tested take the Hepatitis Risk Assessment.</p>
                        <p>In  addition, this month&rsquo;s issue of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0507a1.htm?s_cid=mm62e0507a1_w">Vital Signs</a> focuses on hepatitis C testing,  and suggests that only half of those with hepatitis C receive complete testing  for the virus.

                        <p><em>Asthma</em> is one of the most common lifelong chronic diseases. There  are almost 26 million people living with asthma. The disease affects the lungs,  causing repeated episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and  coughing. Although asthma cannot be cured, it is possible to manage asthma  successfully to reduce and prevent asthma attacks, also called episodes.  Successful asthma management includes knowing the warning signs of an attack,  avoiding things that may trigger an attack, and following the advice of your  healthcare provider. Using what you know about managing your asthma can give you  control over this chronic disease. When you control your asthma, you will  breathe better, be as active as you would like, sleep well, stay out of the  hospital, and be free from coughing and wheezing. To learn more about how you  can control your asthma, visit <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/asthma">CDC's asthma site</a>.</p>
 
                        <p>Asthma affects people of all ages  and backgrounds. In most cases, we don't know what causes asthma, and we don't  know how to cure it. Certain factors may make it more likely for one person to have  asthma than another. If someone in your family has asthma, you are more likely  to have it. Regular physical exams that include checking your lung function and  checking for allergies can help your healthcare provider make the right  diagnosis. With your healthcare provider's help, you can make your own asthma  management plan so that you know what to do based on your own symptoms. Use  your asthma medicine as prescribed and be aware of common triggers in the  environment known to bring on asthma symptoms, including smoke (including  second-hand and third-hand cigarette smoke), household pets, dust mites, and  pollen. Limit or avoid exposure to these and other triggers whenever possible.  The important thing to remember is that <em>you can control your asthma</em>. </p>

                                          <p>Arthritis affects 50 million adults and remains the most  common cause of disability.&nbsp; Arthritis includes more than 100 different  rheumatic diseases and conditions, the most common of which is osteoarthritis.  Other frequently occurring forms of arthritis or other rheumatic conditions  include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, fibromyalgia, and gout. Although arthritis  is more common among adults aged 65 years or older, most cases occur among  those younger than age 65, and people of all ages (including children) can be  affected. Arthritis is more common among women than men in every age group, and  it affects members of all racial and ethnic groups. Arthritis is also more  common among adults who are obese than among those who are normal weight or  underweight.</p>
                                          
<p>What Can Be Done to Address Arthritis?</p>
<ul class="bulleted-links">
<li><strong>Learn techniques to manage arthritis.</strong> Self-management education interventions such as the Arthritis Self-Management Program can teach people how to manage arthritis and lessen its effects. In multiple studies, this intervention was consistently found to improve people's health by reducing depression, fatigue, and health distress. More widespread use of this intervention and similar courses, such as the Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, which addresses arthritis along with other chronic diseases, will improve quality of life for people with arthritis.</li>
  <li><strong>Be physically active.</strong> For people with arthritis, physical activities such as walking, bicycling, and swimming have been shown to have significant benefits, including reducing pain and improving physical function, mental health, and quality of life. The <a href="http://www.arthritis.org/resources/community-programs/walk-with-ease/">Walk with Ease Program</a>, <a href="http://www.arthritis.org/resources/community-programs/excercise/">the Arthritis Foundation Exercise Program</a>, and the <a href="http://www.projectenhance.org/enhancefitness.aspx">Senior Services EnhanceFitness® program</a> are three examples of community exercise interventions that have been shown to improve health among participants.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain a healthy weight and protect your joints.</strong> Weight control and injury prevention measures can lower a person's risk of developing osteoarthritis. Weight loss also can reduce symptoms for overweight or obese people with knee osteoarthritis.</li>
   <li><strong>Consult       a physician.</strong> Early       diagnosis and appropriate management are especially important for people       with inflammatory (red, hot, tender) arthritis. Consulting with a       physician is also important because recommendations from health care       providers are the most influential factor in convincing people to be       physically active and to take an arthritis self-management course.</li>
</ul>


<p>Watch out for the heat. The best defense is prevention. Those at  greatest risk of heat-related illness include infants and children up to 4  years of age.</p>

                                          <p>Stress  can hit you when you least expect it—before a test, after an accident, or  during conflict in a relationship. It can occur during positive times (such as  when planning a wedding) or following a difficult event (such as when dealing  with the effects of a natural disaster). While everyone experiences stress at  times, a prolonged bout of it can affect your health and ability to cope with  life.<br />
That&rsquo;s  why social support and self-care are important. They can help put your  problems into perspective and ease stressful feelings. Follow CDC&rsquo;s suggested tips for  self-care. </p>
<h5>Tips for Self-Care</h5>  
<p>The best ways to manage stress in hard times are through self-care:</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
<li>Avoid drugs and alcohol. They may seem to be a temporary fix to feel better, but in the long run they can create more problems and add to your stress—instead of take it away.</li>
<li>Find support. Seek help from a partner, family member, friend, counselor, doctor, or clergyperson. Having a sympathetic, listening ear and sharing your problems and stress with someone really can lighten the burden and help you find solutions.</li>
<li>Connect socially. After a stressful event, it is easy to isolate yourself. Spending time with loved ones and doing fun activities with your partner, children, or friends can help you and others heal and see that things are going to get better.</li>
<li>Take care of yourself.
<ul > 
<li>Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet</li>
<li>Exercise regularly</li>
<li>Get plenty of sleep</li>
<li>Take some time off if you feel stressed out—for example, treat yourself to a therapeutic massage or take a break from the news about stressful events.</li>
<li>Maintain a normal routine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stay active. You can take your mind off your problems by giving—
helping a neighbor, volunteering in the community, even taking the dog on a long walk. These can be positive ways to channel your feelings.</li>
</ul>

                                          <p>The environmental consequences of climate change are  happening now and are expected to increase in the future. Signs of a changing  climate include:</p>
                                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                                      <li>sea-level rise,</li>
                                            <li>changes in precipitation causing flooding and  drought,</li>
                                            <li>heat waves,</li>
                                            <li>more intense hurricanes and storms, and</li>
                                            <li>poor air quality.</li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <p>Climate change affects human health both directly and  indirectly.</p>
                                          <p>The issue of climate change is broad and complex; addressing  the health effects is challenging. CDC&rsquo;s Climate and Health Program works to  prevent and adapt to the possible health effects of climate change. The program  identifies the populations most vulnerable to these impacts, predicts future  trends, creates systems to detect and respond to emerging health threats, and  designs programs to manage health risks now and in the future. The climate  change funding for CDC represents the only U.S. Government investment dedicated  to preparing our nation to anticipate and adapt to the health effects linked to  climate change.</p>
                                          <p>CDC funds the Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative to  strengthen the capabilities of state and local health agencies to deal with the  challenges associated with climate change. Through CDC funding and technical  support, sixteen state and two city health departments are applying advanced  methods to address the health effects of climate change. As the nation's lead  public health agency, CDC is using its prevention expertise to help state and  city health departments investigate, prepare for, and respond to the health  effects of a changing climate.</p>

                                          <p>Twentieth-century  advances in protecting and promoting health among older adults have provided
many  opportunities for overcoming the challenges of an aging society. The health  indicators presented
in The State  of Aging and Health in America 2013 highlight these opportunities. By working  to meet
the goals for  each of these key indicators, our nation can help to ensure that all of its  citizens can look
forward to  living longer and living well.</p>
                                          <p>The State of  Aging and Health in America 2013 provides a snapshot of our nation&rsquo;s progress  in
                                            promoting  prevention, improving the health and well-being of older adults, and reducing  behaviors
                                            that  contribute to premature death and disability. In addition, the report  highlights mobility (referring to
                                            movement in  all of its forms) and how optimal mobility is fundamental to healthy aging.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Demographic changes create an urgent need</strong><br />
                                            The growth in  the number and proportion of older adults is unprecedented in the history of  the
                                            United  States. Two factors—longer life spans and aging baby boomers—will combine to  double the
                                            population of  Americans aged 65 years or older during the next 25 years to about 72 million.  By 2030,
                                            older adults  will account for roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Chronic conditions present a strong  economic incentive for action</strong><br />
                                            During the  past century, a major shift occurred in the leading causes of death for all age  groups,
                                            including  older adults, from infectious diseases and acute illnesses to chronic diseases  and degenerative
                                            illnesses.  More than a quarter of all Americans and two out of every three older Americans  have
                                            multiple  chronic conditions, and treatment for this population accounts for 66 percent  of the country&rsquo;s health 
                                            care budget.</p>

                                          <p>School age children, from preschoolers to college students,  need vaccines. CDC has online resources and tools to help parents and doctors  make sure all kids are up-to-date on recommended vaccines and protected from serious  diseases.</p>
                        <p>It's true that some vaccine-preventable diseases have become  very rare thanks to vaccines. However, outbreaks still happen. For example,  preliminary data through late July 2013 show that more than 10,000 cases of  whooping cough (pertussis) have already been reported in this country and many  more cases go unreported. Outbreaks of pertussis at middle and high schools can  occur as protection from childhood vaccines fades.</p>
                                          <p>Another disease that can spread very easily  is measles. In 2013 so far, there have been about 130 reported cases of  measles. Most of these people were not vaccinated or did not know their  vaccination status. Measles is brought into the United States by unvaccinated  U.S. residents and foreign travelers who get infected when they are in other  countries. Measles is still common in parts of countries in Europe, Asia, the  Pacific, and Africa. Measles can cause serious complications, such as pneumonia  or inflammation of the brain, and even death. Infants and young children are at  high risk for serious complications from measles.</p>
                                          <p>As kids get older, protection from some childhood vaccines  begins to wear off. Plus, older kids can also develop risks for other diseases.  &nbsp;Back-to-school health check-ups and sports physicals can be a good  opportunity for your preteens and teens to get the recommended vaccines. Making  sure children and teens stay up-to-date with vaccinations is an important step  in protecting them, their schoolmates, and our communities from unnecessary  illness and deaths. </p>

                                          <p>Longer life spans and aging baby  boomers will combine to double the population of older Americans to about 72  million by 2030. Heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic lower respiratory  diseases, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and diabetes continue to be the leading causes of  death among older adults.</p>
                                          <p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/agingandhealth/state_of_aging_and_health_in_america_2013.pdf">State of Aging and Health in America 2013 [PDF  - 3 MB] </a>provides a snapshot of our nation&rsquo;s  progress in promoting prevention, improving the health and well-being of older  adults, and reducing behaviors that contribute to premature death and  disability. The report looks at 15 key health indicators that address health  status (physically unhealthy days, frequent mental distress, oral health and  disability); health behaviors (physical inactivity, nutrition, obesity and  smoking); preventive care and screening (flu and pneumonia vaccine, breast and  colorectal cancer screening); and fall injuries for Americans aged 65 years or  older. As the baby boomer population ages, it is important to take steps to  ensure older adults live long and healthy lives.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Get Screened</strong><strong> </strong><br />
                                            Less than half of men and women aged  65 years or older are up-to-date on preventive services including flu vaccine,  pneumonia vaccine, colorectal cancer screening, and mammography for women.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Get Vaccinated</strong><br />
                                            Flu and pneumonia is the seventh  leading cause of death among adults 65 years or older, despite the availability  of effective vaccines. Older adults should get the flu vaccine every year and  get the pneumonia vaccine at least once.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Be Physically Active</strong><br />
                                            Regular physical activity is one of  the most important things older adults can do for their health. Physical  activity can prevent many of the health problems that may come with age,  including the risk of falls.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Eat Fruits and Vegetables Daily</strong><br />
                                            Diets rich in fruits and vegetables  may reduce the risk of some cancers and chronic diseases, such as diabetes and  cardiovascular disease. Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins and  minerals, fiber, and other substances that are important for good health.<br />
  <em>Adults aged 65 years or older should  eat 5 or more fruits and vegetables daily.</em></p>
                                    <p><strong>Quit Smoking</strong><br />
                                      Tobacco use remains the single  largest preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United  States. For help quitting, visit <a href="http://www.smokefree.gov/">www.smokefree.gov</a>or call 1-800-Quit-Now.</p>
                                          <p><strong>Take Medication for High Blood  Pressure</strong><br />
                                            High blood pressure is a major risk  factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of illness and death among  older adults. Of the almost 67 million Americans with high blood pressure, more  than half do not have it under control. Patients should take the initiative  to monitor their blood pressure between medical visits, take medications as  prescribed, tell their doctor about any side effects, and make lifestyle  changes, such as eating a low-sodium diet, exercising, and stopping smoking.</p>

                                          <p><strong>Suicide  can be prevented. Each year, more than 38,000 Americans take their own lives,  an average of one suicide every 15 minutes.   Suicide results in an estimated $45.8 billion in combined medical and  work loss costs.  September 10th is World  Suicide Prevention Day. Help prevent suicide in your community.</strong></p>
                                          <p>
Suicide (i.e., taking one's own life) is a serious  public health problem that affects people of all ages. For Americans, suicide  is the 10th leading cause of death. It resulted in 38,364 lives lost in 2010.  The top three methods used in suicides included firearm (51%), suffocation  (25%), and poisoning (17%).</p>
<p>
Deaths from suicide are only part of the problem.  More people survive suicide attempts than actually die. In 2011, about 487,700  people received medical care for self-inflicted injuries at emergency  departments across the United States.<br />
Several factors can put a person at risk for  suicide. However, having these risk factors does not always mean that suicide  will occur. Some of the risk factors identified by research include:</p>
                                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                                            <li>History of previous suicide attempts</li>
                                            <li>Family history of suicide</li>
                                            <li>History of depression or other mental illness</li>
                                            <li>History of alcohol or drug abuse</li>
                                            <li>Stressful life event or loss</li>
                                            <li>Easy access to lethal methods</li>
                                            <li>Exposure to the suicidal behavior of others</li>
                                          </ul>
                                          <p>Protective factors buffer individuals from suicidal thoughts and behavior. Some of the protective factors identified by research  include:</p>
                                    <ul class="bullet-list">
                                            <li>Skills in problem solving, conflict resolution, and nonviolent ways of handling disputes</li>
                                            <li>Effective clinical care for mental, physical, and substance abuse disorders</li>
                                            <li>Easy access to a variety of clinical interventions and support for help seeking</li>
                                            <li>Family and community support (connectedness)</li>
                                            <li>Support from ongoing medical and mental health care relationships</li>
                                            <li>Cultural beliefs that discourage suicide and support instincts for self-preservation, including       seeking help</li>
                                          </ul>
                                    <p>Most people are uncomfortable with the topic of  suicide. Too often, victims are blamed and their families and friends are left  stigmatized. As a result, people do not communicate openly about suicide. Thus,  an important public health problem is left shrouded in secrecy, which limits  the amount of information available to those working to prevent suicidal  behavior.<br />
                                            <strong>Know  the Warning Signs and Get Help</strong></p>
                                            <p>
                                            Suicide has many warning signs. For more  information, visit the Web site for <a href="http://www.suicidology.org/web/guest/stats-and-tools/warning-signs" target="_blank">American Association of Suicidology</a>.</p>

                                            The good news is that research over the last several  decades has uncovered a wealth of information about the causes of suicide and  prevention strategies. Additionally, CDC is working to monitor the problem,  develop and evaluate prevention strategies, and to disseminate information to  prevent suicidal behavior.</p>

                                          <ul class="bullet-list">
                                            <li>More than 1 in 4 women and 1 in 10 men in the United       States have experienced rape, physical violence, or stalking by a partner       and report that the violence impacted them in some way (e.g., made them       feel fearful or concerned for their safety, resulted in an injury or need       for services, or they lost days from work or school).</li>
                                            <li>Nearly 10% of U.S. women have been raped by an intimate       partner in their lifetime.</li>
                                            <li>1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have experienced severe       physical violence by an intimate partner (e.g., hit with a fist or       something hard, kicked, beaten, burned, or had a knife or gun used against       them).</li>
                                            <li>IPV resulted in 1,336 deaths in 2010—accounting for 10%       of all homicides. Eighty-two percent of these deaths were females and 18%       were males</li>
                                            <li>The medical care, mental health services, and lost       productivity (e.g., time away from work) cost of IPV was an estimated $5.8       billion in 1995. Updated to 2003 dollars, that&rsquo;s more than $8.3 billion.</li>

                                          <p>If you are a woman age 50  to 74 years, be sure to have a screening mammogram every two years. If you are  age 40–49 years, talk to your doctor about when and how often you should have a  screening mammogram.<br />
                                            <strong>Is breast cancer the most common  cause of death for women?</strong><br />
No. Although many women get  breast cancer, it is not a common cause of death. Heart disease is the number  one cause of death among women age 40 and above, followed by stroke, lung  cancer, and lung diseases. Breast cancer is the fifth leading cause of death.</p>
                                          <p><strong>What is a mammogram?</strong><br />
                                            A mammogram is an X-ray of  the breast. Doctors use a mammogram to look for early signs of breast cancer.  Having regular mammograms can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer. <br />
  <strong>Why should I have a mammogram?</strong></p>
Regular mammograms are the  best tests doctors have to find breast cancer early, sometimes up to three  years before it can be felt. When their breast cancer is found early, many  women go on to live long and healthy lives.

                                          <p>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,  or COPD, refers to a group of diseases, including emphysema, chronic  bronchitis, and in some cases asthma, that cause airflow blockage and  breathing-related problems.. In the United  States, tobacco smoke is a key factor in the development and progression of  COPD. Exposure to air pollutants in the home and workplace, genetic factors,  and respiratory infections also play a role in COPD. In the developing world,  indoor air quality is thought to play a larger role in the development and  progression of COPD than it does in the United States. </p>
                                          <p>
Avoid inhaling tobacco smoke, home and  workplace air pollutants, and respiratory infections to prevent developing  COPD. Early detection of COPD might change its course and progress. A simple  test called spirometry can be used to measure pulmonary—or lung—function and  detect COPD in anyone with breathing problems. Treatment of COPD requires a careful and thorough  evaluation by a physician. COPD treatment can alleviate symptoms, decrease the  frequency and severity of exacerbations, and increase exercise tolerance. </p>
<p>
For those who smoke, the most important  aspect of treatment is smoking cessation. Tobacco smoke and removing other air  pollutants from the patient&rsquo;s home or workplace are also important. Symptoms  such as coughing or wheezing can be treated with medication. Pulmonary  rehabilitation is an individualized treatment program that teaches COPD  management strategies to increase quality of life. Plans may include breathing  strategies, energy-conserving techniques, and nutritional counseling. The flu  can cause serious problems in people with COPD. Vaccination during flu season  is recommended and respiratory infections should be treated with antibiotics,  if appropriate. Patients who have low blood oxygen levels are often given  supplemental oxygen. </p>

Deaths from lung cancer represent about  one out of every six deaths from cancer in the United States. </p>

                                          <p>November is National Epilepsy Awareness  Month. Epilepsy affects about 2 million people in the United States and is  characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures. Delayed recognition of these  seizures and inadequate treatment increases the risk for additional seizures,  disability,decreased health-related quality of life and, in rare instances,  death.</p>
                                          <p>Although epilepsy can occur at any age,  the condition is more likely to begin among children less than 2 years of age  and adults older than 65 years. As do many who live with other chronic  disorders, those with epilepsy often face challenges related to managing  epilepsy treatment, symptoms, disability, lifestyle limitations, emotional  stress, and stigma.</p>
                                          <p>CDC&rsquo;s Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW)  Network is composed of individuals interested in improving the care of people  with epilepsy. MEW Network members, including representatives from U.S.  universities, community-based organizations, and CDC are working together to  develop and test self-management programs and tools that help people with  epilepsy better manage their disorder and improve their quality of life.</p>
                                          <p>MEW programs available to communities  include WebEase, UPLIFT, and PEARLS. WebEase (Epilepsy Awareness Support and  Education) is an internet self-management program designed to improve  medication adherence, stress management, and sleep. UPLIFT (Using Practice and  Learning to Increase Favorable Thoughts) is an internet and telephone program  that combines cognitive behavioral therapy with mindfulness to treat depression  in people with epilepsy. PEARLS (Program to Encourage Active Rewarding Lives)  is a home-based, collaborative-care depression treatment program for adults  with epilepsy.</p>
                                          <p>Interventions that are currently being  tested by MEW network researchers include a self-management program that  combines self-regulation and social support for adults with refractory  epilepsy; an electronic decision-support system for clinics to improve  self-management communication and behavior; and a consumer-driven  self-management program. New projects include a telephone intervention for  rural dwelling adults with epilepsy and cognitive impairment, and  self-management training for adults with epilepsy and co-existing serious  mental illness.</p>

                                    <p>Tips from CDC's Injury Center on <a href="../../motorvehiclesafety/index.html">motor vehicle safety</a> can help you protect yourself, your passengers, and your family and friends.  Whether you're headed around town, out-of-town, or out to celebrate, we wish  you a safe holiday season.<br /><br /></p>
<h5>Protect Your Passengers</h5>
<p>Whenever you're on the road this  holiday season, remember to always buckle up. Wearing your seat belt can reduce  your risk of death or serious injury in a crash by about half. For children 12  and under, the safest place to ride is properly buckled in the back seat in  age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, or seat belts. Car seats  reduce the risk of death in car crashes by 71 percent for infants and 54  percent for toddlers ages 1 to 4. Booster seat use reduces the risk for serious  injury by 45 percent for children aged 4–8 years, when compared with seat belt  use alone.<br />

<h5>Celebrate  Safely</h5>
<p>During the holiday season, and  year-round, take steps to make sure that you and everyone you celebrate with  avoids driving under the influence of alcohol. Following these tips can help  you stay safe:</p>
<ul class="bullet-list">
  <li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Always designate a non-drinking driver before any holiday party or       celebration begins.</li>
  <li><strong>Take the keys</strong>.       Don't let friends drive if they are impaired.</li>
  <li><strong>Be a helpful host.</strong> If you're hosting a party this holiday season, remind your guests to plan       ahead and designate their sober driver; offer alcohol-free beverages; and       make sure all of your guests leave with a sober driver.</li>
