    	<p>If you have not done so already, <a href="../removal/index.html">remove the tick</a> with fine-tipped tweezers.</p><p>The chances that you might get Lyme disease from a single tick bite depend on the type of tick, where you acquired it, and how long it was attached to you. Many types of ticks bite people in the U.S., but only <a href="../transmission/index.html">blacklegged ticks</a> transmit the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Furthermore, only blacklegged ticks in the <a href="../stats/index.html">highly endemic areas</a> of the northeastern and north central U.S. are commonly infected. Finally, blacklegged ticks need to be attached for at least 24 hours before they can transmit Lyme disease. This is why it&#39;s so important to remove them promptly and to check your body daily for ticks if you live in an endemic area.</p><p>If you develop illness within a few weeks of a tick bite, see your health care provider right away. <a href="../signs_symptoms/index.html">Common symptoms</a> of Lyme disease include a rash, fever, body aches, facial paralysis, and arthritis. Ticks can also transmit <a href="../../ticks/diseases/index.html">other diseases</a>, so it&#39;s important to be alert for any illness that follows a tick bite.</p>

									<h3>Can Lyme disease be transmitted sexually?</h3>
		<div>
						
			<div class="rx-row">
    	<p>There is no credible scientific evidence that Lyme disease can be spread from person-to-person through sexual contact. The biology of the Lyme spirochete is not consistent with sexual transmission, attempts to demonstrate sexual transmission in infected animals have all failed, and there has not been a single, adequately documented case of sexual transmission of Lyme disease reported in the scientific literature.</p><p>The following are some of the <strong>false arguments</strong> put forth to suggest sexual transmission:</p>
			<div class="syndicate">
<div class="mSyndicate">
	    <div class="module-typeF" >
				<div>
		<p class="indent"><strong><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> and <em>Treponema pallidum</em> (the cause of syphilis) are both spirochetes (cork screw shaped bacteria). Therefore, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> can be transmitted like syphilis.</strong> Not true. Although <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and <em>T. pallidum</em> are both spirochetes, they are not closely related. More importantly, they behave very differently within humans in ways that affect their potential for sexual transmission. <em>T. pallidum</em> spirochetes produce moist, superficial skin lesions (e.g., chancres on the genital, anal or oral mucosa) that contain enormous numbers of living spirochetes and are crucial to transmission by sexual contact.&#160;In contrast, <em>B. burgdorferi</em> spirochetes cannot survive on the surface of the skin or genital mucosa. They are present only in sparse numbers and only in the deep inner layers of the skin. Whereas syphilis spirochetes can penetrate the skin directly, Lyme disease spirochetes require a highly ordered metabolic process associated with feeding by certain species of ticks.</p><p class="indent"><strong><em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> has been isolated from breast milk and semen.</strong> Actually, it hasn&#39;t. A single study reportedly found evidence of <em>Borrelia</em> DNA in breast milk using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. PCR assays detect DNA from dead or living organisms, do not demonstrate the presence of living organisms, and are prone to false positive results. Peer-reviewed and published studies of semen have involved collecting semen from animals, inoculating the semen with bacterial growth media and millions of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, and then artificially inseminating the animal with the media containing experimentally <em>B. burgdorferi</em> infected semen. The results of these studies provide no evidence that <em>B. burgdorferi</em> occurs naturally in semen.</p><p class="indent"><strong>Husband and wife both have Lyme disease, and at least one doesn&#39; t remember a tick bite.</strong> It is not uncommon for more than one person in a household to develop Lyme disease. This occurs because household members share the same environment where infected ticks are abundant. Patients are often unaware of having been bitten because the ticks that transmit Lyme disease are extremely small.</p>				</div>

    	<p>The lone star tick is primarily found in the southeastern and eastern United States. Lone star ticks do not transmit Lyme disease.

The rash usually appears within seven days of tick bite and expands to a diameter of 8 centimeters (3 inches) or more. The rash should not be confused with much smaller areas of redness and discomfort that can occur commonly at tick bite sites. Unlike Lyme disease, STARI has not been linked to arthritis, neurological problems, or chronic symptoms. Nevertheless, the similarity between the STARI bull&#8217;s eye rash and the Lyme disease bull&#8217;s eye rash has created much public confusion. The pathogen responsible for STARI has not been identified.</p><p>In contrast, Lyme disease in North America is caused by a specific type of bacteria, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>, which is transmitted by two species of blacklegged ticks, <em>Ixodes scapularis</em> and <em>Ixodes pacificus</em>. While blacklegged ticks exist in the southern U.S., their feeding habits in this region make them much less likely to maintain, sustain, and transmit Lyme disease.</p>

    	<p>Maybe. The blacklegged ticks that transmit Lyme disease can sometimes also transmit <a href="../../parasites/babesiosis.1.html" title="Babesiosis">babesiosis</a> and <a href="../../anaplasmosis/index.html" title="anaplasmosis">anaplasmosis</a>. Fortunately, Lyme disease and anaplasmosis are treated with the same antibiotics, so if you are receiving treatment for Lyme disease, anaplasmosis will be treated at the same time (Wormser et al. 2006). Babesiosis is a parasitic disease that is treated with different medications. If your Lyme disease symptoms do not seem to be going away after taking antibiotics, see your health care provider.</p><p>There is, however, a great deal of misinformation regarding tickborne coinfections on the internet. The possibility of having three or more tickborne infections or having pathogens such <em>Bartonella</em> or <em>Mycoplasma</em> (which have not been shown to be tickborne), is extremely unlikely.</p><p>The chance of having multiple tickborne infections depends on your location. Several studies have looked at the prevalence of these different organisms in ticks, though methods and locations are very different. Studies have shown that the rate of coinfection in blacklegged ticks varies by region from 1 to 28%. The most common coinfection in ticks is <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme disease) and <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em> (anaplasmosis). The frequency of tickborne coinfections in Lyme disease patients from endemic areas ranges from 4 to 45% (Swanson et al. 2006). From 2 to 12% of patients with early Lyme disease may also have anaplasma infection, and 2 to 40% of patients with early Lyme disease may also have babesia infection, depending on the region (Wormser, 2006).</p><p><strong>References:</strong></p><p>Lantos PM, Wormser GP. <a href="http://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(14)00476-8/fulltext">Chronic coinfections in patients diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease: a systematic review</a>. <em>Am J Med</em>. 2014 Nov;127(11):1105-10.

    	<p>As with many infectious diseases, there is no test that can &#8220;prove&#8221; cure. Tests for Lyme disease detect antibodies produced by the human immune system to fight off the bacteria (<em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>) that cause Lyme disease. These antibodies can persist long after the infection is gone. This means that if your blood tests positive, then it will likely continue to test positive for months or even years even though the bacteria are no longer present.</p><p>A research tool called PCR can detect bacterial DNA in some patients. Unfortunately, this is also not helpful as a test of whether the antibiotics have killed all the bacteria. Studies have shown that DNA fragments from dead bacteria can be detected for many months after treatment. Studies have also shown that the remaining DNA fragments are not infectious. Positive PCR test results are analogous to a crime scene &#8211; &#8211; just because a robbery occurred and the robber left his DNA, it doesn&#39; t mean that the robber is still in the house. Similarly, just because DNA fragments from an infection remain, it doesn&#39; t mean the bacteria are alive or viable.</p>

    	<p>No. The tests for Lyme disease detect antibodies made by the immune system to fight off the bacteria, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>.

    	<p>No. Patients treated with antibiotics in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely.

Approximately 10 to 20% of patients experience fatigue, muscle aches, sleep disturbance, or difficulty thinking even after completing a recommended course of antibiotic treatment. These symptoms cannot be cured by longer courses of antibiotics, but they generally improve on their own, over time.</p>

<div class="mSyndicate">
		<div class="rx-row">
    	
<p>Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacterium <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em>. In the majority of cases, it is successfully treated with oral antibiotics. Physicians sometimes describe patients who have non-specific symptoms (like fatigue, pain, and joint and muscle aches) after the treatment of Lyme disease as having <a href="../postlds/index.html">post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome</a> (PTLDS) or post Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS).</p>

<p>The term “chronic Lyme disease” (CLD) has been used to describe people with different illnesses. While the term is sometimes used to describe illness in patients with Lyme disease, in many occasions it has been used to describe symptoms in people who have no evidence of a current or past infection with <em>B. burgdorferi</em> (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430045/">Marques, 2008</a>). Because of the confusion in how the term CLD is employed, experts in this field do not support its use (<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra072023">Feder et al., 2007</a>).</p>

<p>Each year, approximately 30,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported to CDC by state health departments and the District of Columbia. However, this number does not reflect every case of Lyme disease that is diagnosed in the United States every year.</p>

<p>Surveillance systems provide vital information but they do not capture every illness. Because only a fraction of illnesses are reported, researchers need to estimate the total burden of illness to set public health goals, allocate resources, and measure the economic impact of disease. CDC uses the best data available and makes reasonable adjustments—based on related data, previous study results, and common assumptions—to account for missing pieces of information.</p>

<p>To improve public health, CDC wants to know how many people are actually diagnosed with Lyme disease each year and for this reason has conducted two studies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Project 1 (<a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/59/5/676?ijkey=JvyWcwRMpPmKo&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=cid">Lyme Disease Testing by Large Commercial Laboratories in the United States</a>) estimated the number of <strong>people who tested positive for Lyme disease</strong> based on data obtained from a survey of clinical laboratories. Researchers estimated that 288,000 (range 240,000–444,000) infections occur among patients for whom a laboratory specimen was submitted in 2008.</li>

<li>Project 2 (<a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/21/9/15-0417_article">Incidence of Clinician-Diagnosed Lyme Disease, United States, 2005–2010</a>) estimated the number of <strong>people diagnosed with Lyme disease</strong> based on medical claims information from a large insurance database. In this study, researchers estimated that 329,000 (range 296,000–376,000) cases of Lyme disease occur annually in the United States.</li>
</ul>

<p>Results of these studies suggest that the number of people diagnosed with Lyme disease each year in the United States is around 300,000. Notably, these estimates <strong>do not</strong> affect our understanding of the geographic distribution of Lyme disease. Lyme disease cases are concentrated in the Northeast and upper Midwest, with 14 states accounting for over 96% of cases reported to CDC. The results obtained using the new estimation methods mirror the geographic distribution of cases that is shown by national surveillance.</p>

    	<p>As with most other <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_nd/" title="MMWR--Summary of Notifiable Diseases">reportable diseases</a>, reporting requirements for Lyme disease are determined by state laws or regulations. In most states, Lyme disease cases are reported by licensed health care providers, diagnostic laboratories, or hospitals. States and the District of Columbia remove all personally identifiable information, then share their data with CDC, which compiles and publishes the information for the Nation. <strong>CDC has no way of linking this information back to the original patient.</strong></p><p>CDC summarizes national surveillance data based on these reports, and publishes results in the CDC publication, the Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report. The latest summary was published in the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/ss5710a1.htm" title="MMWR, Surveillance for Lyme Disease 1992-2006">MMWR Surveillance Summary for Lyme Disease--United States, 1992-2006.</a></p><p>The goal of Lyme disease surveillance is not to capture every case, but to systematically gather and analyze public health data in a way that enables public health officials to look for trends and take actions to reduce disease and improve public health.</p>

<p>Reporting of all nationally notifiable diseases, including Lyme disease, is based on standard surveillance case definitions developed by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) and CDC. The usefulness of public health surveillance data depends on its uniformity, simplicity, and timeliness. Surveillance case definitions establish uniform criteria for disease reporting and should not be used as the sole criteria for establishing clinical diagnoses, determining the standard of care necessary for a particular patient, setting guidelines for quality assurance, or providing standards for reimbursement. <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/lyme-disease/">The national surveillance case definition for Lyme disease is available on CDC' s web site.</a></p>

<p>Prompt diagnosis and proper treatment are critical to preventing medical complications of Lyme disease. CDC is committed to providing patients and health care providers with accurate, evidence-based information on the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.</p>

<h4>What do the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommendations cover?</h4>

<p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America develops <a href="https://www.idsociety.org/Guidelines_Patient_Care/">clinical practice guidelines on various topics.</a> IDSA <a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full">guidelines</a> encompass the full scope of Lyme disease clinical care and management, providing not only descriptions of treatment, but also essential information about the diagnosis and prevention of Lyme disease as well as anaplasmosis and babesiosis (other tickborne diseases). The authors are internationally recognized experts associated with some of the Nation’s leading medical institutions. IDSA guidelines address the full spectrum of disease manifestations including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Early Lyme disease in the absence of erythema migrans (early skin manifestations)</li>

<li>Lyme arthritis</li>

<li>Early neurologic Lyme disease</li>

<li>Late neurologic Lyme disease</li>

<li>Lyme carditis</li>

<li>Borrelial lymphocytosis (a bluish-red skin condition)</li>

<li>Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (a skin condition indicative of late Lyme disease)</li>

<li>Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Are the IDSA guidelines up to date?</h4>

<p>Published in 2006, the IDSA guidelines were reevaluated and upheld by an independent scientific Review Panel whose members were certified to be free from any conflicts of interest by an independent ombudsman. In addition, CDC doctors monitor and evaluate the medical literature, including treatment guidelines, regularly. If new scientific information emerges that conflicts with treatment or management recommendations of the guidelines, CDC will act accordingly to make sure that patients and health care providers are aware. &#160;CDC believes that the current IDSA Lyme disease guidelines, <em><a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/9/1089.full">“The Clinical Assessment, Treatment, and Prevention of Lyme Disease, Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis and Babesiosis: Clinical Practice Guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America,”</a></em> continue to provide comprehensive, accurate information that patients can use in their health care decisions.</p>

<p>Lyme Corps is a train-the trainer approach to Lyme disease prevention and education dedicated to developing a talented, committed team of students and residents who provide Lyme disease education and outreach to both health care providers and the public. The program focuses on prevention and early recognition of Lyme disease and other tickborne diseases.</p>

<p>Lyme Corps is community-based. Members are medical and public health students chosen annually from a selected university system in highly Lyme endemic areas. The members facilitate Lyme disease education in conjunction with local health care systems, health departments, schools, and community events (farmers’ markets, trail runs, etc.). &#160;Universities and states involved in Lyme Corps include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Drexel University/Philadelphia Dept. of Health, 2012-2013</li>

<li>University of Virginia/<a href="http://www.healthsci.jmu.edu/pa/features/lymecorps.html">James Madison University</a>/Virginia Dept. of Health, 2013-2014</li>

<li><a href="https://uvmmedicineblog.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/joining-lyme-corps-to-raise-awareness-in-vermont/">University of Vermont</a>/Vermont Dept. of Health, 2014-2015</li>

<li>University of Maryland/Johns Hopkins University/Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences/ Maryland Dept. of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2015-2016</li>
</ul>

<p>Lyme Corps participants have also assisted with the following research projects:</p>
