Regardless of where they were purchased, all live poultry can carry <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria, even if they look healthy and clean.</li>
<li>This year saw the largest number of illnesses linked to contact with backyard poultry ever recorded. These outbreaks are a reminder to follow <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/features/salmonellapoultry/index.html">steps</a> to keep your family healthy while enjoying your backyard flock.
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>Always wash hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching live poultry or anything in the area where the birds live and roam.</li>
<li>Do not let live poultry inside the house.</li>
<li>Do not let children younger than 5 years handle or touch chicks, ducklings, or other live poultry without adult supervision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>CDC, multiple states, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) investigated eight separate multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to contact with live poultry in backyard flocks.
<ul class="list-bullet">
<li>In the eight outbreaks, 895 people infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> were reported from 48 states.</li>

<h5 class="case-update">Introduction</h5>
<p>As of September 26, 2016, 895 people infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> were reported from 48 states. A list of states and the number of cases in each can be found on the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/live-poultry-05-16/map.html">Case Count Map page</a>.</p>
<p>Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from January 4, 2016 to September 10, 2016. Ill people ranged in age from less than 1 year to 106, with a median age of 27. Of ill people, 52% were female. Among 761 ill people with available information, 209 (27%) reported being hospitalized, and three deaths were reported. <em>Salmonella</em> was considered to be a cause of death for one person in Mississippi. Although the two people who died in Kentucky and New Jersey had a <em>Salmonella</em> infection, the infection was not considered to be a cause of death.</p>
<h5>Investigation of the Outbreak</h5>
<p>Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings linked the eight outbreaks to contact with live poultry, such as chicks and ducklings, from multiple hatcheries.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Contact with live poultry (chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings) in the week before becoming ill was reported by 552 of 745 ill people interviewed, or 74%.</p>
<p>Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several suppliers, including feed supply stores, Internet sites, hatcheries, and friends in multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to produce eggs, learn about agriculture, have as a hobby, enjoy for fun, keep as pets, or to give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported contact with live poultry included their home, someone else’s home, work, or school settings.</p>
<p>Public health officials collected samples from live poultry and the environments where the poultry live and roam from the homes of ill people in several states or at locations of purchase in several states. Laboratory testing isolated five of the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em>.</p>

<br>
<h4 class="case-update">Outbreak Summary Update</h4>
<p>Since the last update on June 2, 2016, one more outbreak was identified, bringing the total to eight outbreaks under investigation. Another 287 ill people have been reported from 45 states for these eight outbreaks.</p>
<p>As of July 14, 2016, 611 people infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> have been reported from 45 states. A list of states and the number of cases in each can be found on the <a href="map.html">Case Count Map page</a>.</p>
<p>Among people for whom information is available, illnesses started on dates ranging from January 4, 2016 to June 25, 2016. Ill people range in age from less than 1 year to 93, with a median age of 20. Of ill people, 52% are female. Among 496 ill people with available information, 138 (28%) reported being hospitalized, and one death was reported. <em>Salmonella</em> was not considered to be a cause of death.</p>
<p>Illnesses that started after June 16, 2016 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of <a href="../reporting-timeline.html">2 to 4 weeks</a>.</p>
<h4>Investigation Update</h4>
<p>Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory findings have linked the eight outbreaks to contact with live poultry such as chicks and ducklings from multiple hatcheries.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Contact with live poultry (chicks, chickens, ducks, ducklings) in the week before becoming ill was reported by 434 of 493 ill people interviewed, or 88%.</p>
<p>Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several suppliers, including feed supply stores, Internet sites, hatcheries, and friends in multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to produce eggs, learn about agriculture, have as a hobby, enjoy for fun, keep as pets, or to give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported contact with live poultry include their home, someone else’s home, work, or school settings.</p>
<p>Public health officials collected samples from live poultry and the environments where the poultry live and roam from the homes of ill people in several states. Laboratory testing isolated four of the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em>.</p>
<p>More information about each outbreak is available in the outbreak summaries below.</p>
</div></div></div><h3>Initial Announcement</h3><div><div class=""><div>
<br>
<h4 class="case-update">Introduction</h4>
<p>CDC is collaborating with public health, veterinary, and agriculture officials in many states, as well as the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS), to investigate seven separate multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Results from these investigations showed that contact with live poultry in backyard flocks was the likely source of these outbreaks.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Features/SalmonellaBabyBirds/">Contact with live poultry</a> (such as chicks, chickens, ducks, and ducklings) and their environment can make people sick with <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Regardless of where they are purchased, live poultry may have <em>Salmonella</em> germs in their droppings and on their bodies (feathers, feet, and beaks) even when they appear healthy and clean. The germs can also get on cages, coops, hay, plants, and soil in the area where the birds live and roam. People, especially children, can be exposed to <em>Salmonella</em> by holding, cuddling, or kissing the birds and by touching things where the bird lives, such as cages or feed and water bowls.</p>
<p>Public health investigators are using the <a href="../../pulsenet/index.html">PulseNet</a> system to identify illnesses that may be part of these outbreaks. PulseNet, coordinated by CDC, is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories. PulseNet performs DNA fingerprinting on <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria isolated from ill people by using techniques called <a href="../../pulsenet/pathogens/pfge.html">pulsed-field gel electrophoresis</a> (PFGE) and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/next-generation.html#next-gen">whole genome sequencing</a> (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these DNA fingerprints to identify possible outbreaks.</p>
<h4>Investigation of the Outbreaks</h4>
<p>In seven separate multistate outbreaks, a total of 324 people infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> were reported from 35 states. Among people who reported the date they became ill, illnesses started on dates ranging from January 4, 2016 to May 11, 2016. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the <a href="map.html">Case Count Map page</a>.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill people answered questions about contact with animals and other exposures in the week before becoming ill; 217 (91%) of the 238 people interviewed reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness. Ill people reported purchasing live baby poultry from several different suppliers, including feed supply stores, Co-Ops, hatcheries, and friends in multiple states. Ill people reported purchasing live poultry to produce eggs, learn about agriculture, have as a hobby,enjoy for fun, keep as pets, or to give as Easter gifts. Some of the places ill people reported contact with live poultry include at their home, someone else’s home, work, or school settings.</p>
<p>The CDC <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/narms/">National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) human surveillance program</a> monitors antibiotic resistance in <em>Salmonella</em> and other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC’s NARMS laboratory conducted antibiotic-resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from three people infected with one of the seven outbreak strains. All three isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. CDC’s NARMS laboratory continues to conduct antibiotic-resistance testing on additional clinical isolates collected from ill persons infected with one of the outbreak strains. Results will be reported when they become available.</p>
<p>NARMS is a U.S. public health surveillance system that tracks antibiotic resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state and local health departments.</p>
