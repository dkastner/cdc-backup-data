<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>CDC collaborated with public health and agriculture officials in many states and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (FDA-CVM) to investigate eight outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to exposure to turtles and their environments. Public health investigators used the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet">PulseNet</a> system to identify cases of illness that were part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA “fingerprints” of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that were part of this outbreak. Outbreak strains were defined by PFGE pattern and serotype.</p>
<p>A total of 473 persons infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> were reported from 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico: Alabama (4), Alaska (2), Arizona (27), Arkansas (4), California (106), Colorado (6), Connecticut (1), Delaware (4), Florida (1), Georgia (10), Illinois (10), Indiana (1), Kansas (2), Kentucky (3), Louisiana (5), Maine (1), Maryland (17), Massachusetts (12), Michigan (5), Minnesota (1), Mississippi (4), Missouri (4), Nevada (11), New Jersey (26), New Mexico (15), New York (55), North Carolina (3), Ohio (6), Oregon (1), Pennsylvania (34), Puerto Rico (1), Rhode Island (1), South Carolina (17), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (7), Texas (45), Utah (1), Vermont (1), Virginia (5), Washington (5), Washington, D.C. (3), Wisconsin (2) and West Virginia (3).</p>
<p>Among 473 persons, reported and estimated illness onset dates ranged from May 23, 2011, to September 9, 2013. Among 462 persons for whom information was available, ill persons ranged in age from less than 1 year to 94 years, with a median age of 4 years. Seventy percent of ill persons were children 10 years of age or younger, and 31% of ill persons were children 1 year of age or younger. Fifty-five percent of ill persons were female. Among 192 persons for whom information was available, 85 (44%) ill persons were of Hispanic ethnicity. Information about the association between reptiles and <em>Salmonella</em> is available in Spanish. Among 272 persons with available information, 78 (29%) were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.</p>
<p>The numbers of new cases have declined substantially since the peak of the outbreak,  which occurred from July 2012 to September 2012, but illnesses are still being reported among people who have contact with small turtles. The outbreak is expected to continue at a low level for the next several months since consumers might be unaware of the risk of <em>Salmonella</em> infection from reptiles including small turtles. If properly cared for, small turtles have a long life expectancy.</p>
<p><a href="../../zoonotic/gi/index.html">Turtles of any size, as well as other reptiles and amphibians</a>, can be a source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections. However, small turtles have been linked to more outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections than other pet reptiles and amphibians. More information about <em>Salmonella</em> from reptiles and amphibians and the steps people can take to reduce their risk of infection is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/features/salmonellafrogturtle/index.html">available</a>.</p>
<h4>Investigation of the Outbreaks</h4>
<p>Epidemiologic, environmental, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies linked these outbreaks to exposure to turtles and their environments.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with animals and foods eaten during the week before becoming ill. One hundred and eighty-seven (69%) of 272 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 141 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtle with which they had contact, 124 (88%) specifically reported exposure to turtles with shell length less than 4 inches. Fifty-five (80%) of 70 ill persons recalled contact with red eared slider turtles, which are commonly owned as pets. Other types of pet turtles such as yellow bellied sliders and mud turtles were also reported by ill people, however in many cases the specific type of turtle was not known.</p>
<p>One hundred and sixteen ill persons reported where they acquired their small turtle. The most common source of small turtle purchase was street vendors, reported by 36 (31%) patients. Turtles were purchased from multiple other sources, including pet stores [21 (18%)], flea markets [14 (12%)], discount stores [8 (7%)], souvenir/gift shops [6 (5%)], other stores [4 (3%)], and online [3 (3%)]. Nineteen (16%) patients received small turtles as gifts, and 5 (4%) patients acquired turtles from a carnival, car show, fair, festival, or swap meet.</p>
<p>State and local public health departments and regulatory agencies collected swab samples from turtles and turtle tank water from turtle habitats at ill persons’ homes and at retail establishments where ill persons reported purchasing turtles. <em>Salmonella</em> with patterns matching outbreak strains were identified from ill persons’ turtles or turtle habitats in seven of the eight outbreaks: outbreaks 1-6 and outbreak 8.  Turtle tank samples from retail stores where turtles in outbreaks 3 and 6 were purchased yielded the outbreak 3 and outbreak 6 strains, respectively. In four outbreaks, turtle tank water yielded one or more outbreak strains.</p>
<p>Information provided by ill persons infected in several outbreaks was used by investigators from multiple state public health and agriculture agencies and FDA to trace the small turtles in ill persons’ households to retail establishments, turtle brokers, and eventually turtle farms. Traceback investigations of turtles purchased from Florida souvenir shops identified two turtle farms in Louisiana as the source of the turtles. The Florida Department of Health and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have collaborated to stop the sale of turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches from these shops. <em>Salmonella</em> with patterns matching outbreak strains 2 and 3 were identified from a turtle pond at one of the Louisiana turtle farms. The Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry issued cease and desist orders in March 2013 for the source farms; therefore, turtles with a shell length of less than 4 inches from these farms are no longer being sold domestically.  The source of turtles in other outbreaks could not be identified because of the challenges of tracing small turtles that are sold illegally by transient vendors.</p>

<h4>Investigation Overview</h4>
<p>Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians (such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can carry <em>Salmonella</em> germs and still appear healthy and clean. <em>Salmonella</em> germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people.</p>
<p>CDC continues to collaborate with public health officials in multiple states and the FDA to investigate 8 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat). Because the majority of ill persons who reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.</p>
<p>Public health investigators are using DNA “fingerprints” of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of these outbreaks. Using this method, a total of 347 persons infected with the outbreak strains of <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, Newport, Pomona, Poona, I 4,[5],12:i:-, and Typhimurium have been reported from 37 states and the District of Columbia in overlapping, multistate outbreaks linked to contact with small turtles and their habitats. Twenty-eight percent of ill persons have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported. Seventy percent of ill persons are children 10 years of age or younger, and 33% of ill persons are children 1 year of age or younger. Forty-four percent of ill persons are of Hispanic ethnicity.</p>
<p>Results of the epidemiologic and environmental investigations indicate exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat) is the source of these outbreaks. Seventy percent of ill persons reported exposure to turtles prior to their illness. Ninety percent of ill persons with turtle exposure specifically reported exposure to small turtles. Thirty-three percent of ill persons with small turtles reported purchasing the turtles from street vendors, and 11% reported purchasing small turtles from pet stores. Illnesses that occurred after January 3, 2013 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.

<h4>Investigation Overview</h4>
<p>Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians (such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can carry <em>Salmonella</em> germs and still appear healthy and clean. <em>Salmonella</em> germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people.</p>
<p>CDC continues to collaborate with public health officials in multiple states and the FDA to investigate 6 overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat). Because the majority of ill persons who reported contact with small turtles purchased the turtles from a street vendor, it is difficult to determine the original source of the turtles.</p>
<p>The 6 multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to small turtles are numbered in the order in which they were identified. The details of each investigation are described below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Outbreak 1: <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, Strain A and <em>Salmonella</em> Newport, Strain A</h4>

One ill person infected with <em>Salmonella</em> Newport was included in the case count based on epidemiologic and laboratory evidence linking them with this outbreak. The 7 new cases are from California (3), New Mexico (1), Nevada (1), and Texas (2).</p>
<p>Illness onset dates range from August 3, 2011 to May 24, 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 year to 86 years, with a median age of 8 years. Sixty-one percent of patients are female. Among 44 persons with available information, 10 (23%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>

<h4>Outbreak 1: <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, Strain A</h4>
<h4 class="case-update">Case Count Update</h4>
<p>A total of 55 individuals infected with <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, strain A have been reported from 13 states. The 5 new cases are from Illinois (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (1), and South Carolina (1).</p>
<p>Illnesses began between August 3, 2011 and April 16, 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 to 86 years, with a median age of 7 years. Sixty-two percent of patients are female. Among 39 persons with available information, 10 (25%) reported being hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>Illnesses that occurred after March 19, 2012, might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.</p>
<h4>Investigation Update</h4>
<p>Among the 41 ill persons for whom information is available, 32 (78%) reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Twenty-two persons who reported contact with turtles also reported the size of the turtle; of these, 21 (95%) reported a turtle with a shell length of less than 4 inches. Among those reporting small turtles, 8 (42%) of the 19 with information available were exposed to turtles purchased from a street vendor. Of the 9 ill persons who reported the type of turtle they had contact with, 8 (89%) reported red-eared slider turtles.</p>
<h4>Environmental Sampling Update</h4>
<p>In March 2012, samples of turtle tank water and turtles from the homes of 2 ill persons in New York yielded the outbreak strain, <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, strain A.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Outbreak 2: <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona, Strain A</h4>
<h4 class="case-update">Case Count Update</h4>
<p>No new cases have been reported since the March 30, 2012 investigation announcement. Among the 9 cases, 3 (33%) have been hospitalized. Illnesses that occurred after March 28, 2012 might not be reported yet due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported.</p>
<h4>Investigation Update</h4>
<p>Among the 5 ill persons who reported contact with turtles before becoming ill, 3 (63%) described the size of the turtle they had contact with. All 3 (100%) identified turtles with shell length of less than 4 inches.</p>
<h4>Environmental Sampling Update</h4>
<p>In March 2012, one sample of turtle tank water from the home of a person in New York who was infected with <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, strain A yielded 2 outbreak strains. These strains were <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona, strain A and <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, strain A. This suggests that the turtles causing Outbreak 1 and Outbreak 2 may originate from a common source.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Outbreak 3: <em>Salmonella</em> Poona, Strain A</h4>
<h4 class="case-update">Case Count Update</h4>
<p>A total of 15 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of <em>Salmonella</em> Poona have been reported from 8 states. The 3 new cases are from Alabama (1), New York (1), and Texas (1).</p>

<h4>Outbreak 1: <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, Strain A</h4>
<h4 class="case-update">Case Count Update</h4>
<p>A total of 50 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The 5 new ill persons have been reported from California (4) and Minnesota (1) and have onset dates in August 2011. The <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego outbreak definition was expanded to include cases whose illness began in August 2011, because new epidemiologic evidence suggested that the outbreak began earlier than what was previously reported. Twenty-eight (82%) of 34 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 19 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, 18 (95%) identified turtles less than four inches in size.

<h4>Initial Announcement</h4>
<p>CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states to investigate three overlapping, multistate outbreaks of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections linked to exposure to turtles or their environments (e.g., water from a turtle habitat). The first is an outbreak of human <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego infections, the second is an outbreak of human <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona infections, and the third is an outbreak of human <em>Salmonella</em> Poona infections. These are rare types of <em>Salmonella</em>. The <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego and <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona outbreaks have similar geographic distributions, with cases occurring in the Northeast and Southwest. The <em>Salmonella</em> Poona outbreak has a slightly different geographic distribution, with cases occurring in the Midwest and Southwest. Public health investigators are using the <a id="anch_46" href="http://www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/" style=" -ms-zoom: 1;">PulseNet</a> system to identify cases of illness that may be part of these outbreaks. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA “fingerprints” of <em>Salmonella</em> bacteria are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.</p>
<p>These outbreaks can be visually described with a chart showing the number of persons who became ill each day. This chart is called an <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/small-turtles-03-12/epi.html">epidemic curve or epi curve</a>. Illnesses that occurred after January 26, 2012 might not yet be reported due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported. This takes an average of 2 to 3 weeks. Please see the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/outbreaks/reporting_timeline.html"><em>Salmonella</em> Outbreak Investigations: Timeline for Reporting Cases</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Contact with reptiles (such as turtles, snakes, and lizards) and amphibians (such as frogs and toads) can be a source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections. Small turtles, with a shell length of less than 4 inches, are a well-known source of human <em>Salmonella</em> infections, especially among young children. Because of this risk, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the sale and distribution of these turtles since 1975. Amphibians and reptiles can carry <em>Salmonella</em> germs and still appear healthy and clean. <em>Salmonella</em> germs are shed in their droppings and can easily contaminate their bodies and anything in areas where these animals live. Reptiles and amphibians that live in tanks or aquariums can contaminate the water with germs, which can spread to people.</p>
<h4>Outbreak 1: <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego, Strain A Outbreak Investigation</h4>
<p>As of March 26, 2012, a total of 45 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of <em>Salmonella</em> Sandiego have been reported from 10 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (3), Georgia (1), Massachusetts (2), Maryland (5), New Jersey (5), New Mexico (3), New York (18), North Carolina (1), Pennsylvania (6), and Virginia (1).</p>
<p>Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between September 1, 2011 and March 16, 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than one year old to 86 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 9 years of age or younger. Fifty-eight percent of patients are female. Among the 25 patients with available information, 7 (28%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Nineteen (76%) of 25 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 13 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, 12 (92%) identified turtles less than four inches in size. Of the 6 ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, 5 (83%) identified red-eared slider turtles.</p>
<p>In February 2012, one sample of turtle tank water from an ill person’s home in Pennsylvania yielded the outbreak strain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Outbreak 2: <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona, Strain A Outbreak Investigation</h4>
<p>As of March 26, 2012, a total of 9 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of <em>Salmonella</em> Pomona have been reported from 8 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: California (2), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), New Jersey (1), New York (1), Pennsylvania (1), Texas (1), and Vermont (1).</p>
<p>Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between December 9, 2011 and February 6, 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than one year old to 90 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 4 years of age or younger. Seventy-five percent of patients are female. Among the 8 patients with available information, 2 (25%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Five (63%) of eight ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the 2 ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, 2 (100%) identified turtles less than four inches in size.</p>
<p>In January 2012, one sample of turtle tank water from the home of 2 ill persons in the same California household yielded the outbreak strain.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Outbreak 3: <em>Salmonella</em> Poona, Strain A Outbreak Investigation</h4>
<p>As of March 26, 2012, a total of 12 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of <em>Salmonella</em> Poona have been reported from 7 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (2), California (3), Indiana (1), Kentucky (1), Michigan (1), New York (2), and Texas (2).</p>
<p>Among the persons who reported the date they became ill, illnesses began between October 20, 2011 and February 18, 2012. Infected individuals range in age from less than one year old to 70 years old, and 50% of ill persons are 4 years of age or younger. Sixty-seven percent of patients are female. Among the 7 patients with available information, 2 (29%) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.</p>
<p>In interviews, ill persons answered questions about contact with turtles and foods consumed during the week before becoming ill. Nine (90%) of 10 ill persons interviewed reported contact with turtles before becoming ill. Of the five ill persons who could recall the size of the turtles with which they had contact, four (80%) described turtles less than four inches in size. Of the 7 ill persons who could recall the type of turtle with which they had contact, 7 (100%) identified red-eared slider turtles.</p>
